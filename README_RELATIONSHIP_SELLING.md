# PREFACE

### Welcome to Relationship Selling through Service
* Obtaining new customers and retaining present ones are the main challenges of salespeople. Increase in sales and profits is up to the sales personnel--the people who represent their employers through interacting with present or prospective customers. Sales professionals strive to create a long-term business relationship, which implies that personal relationships with clients are formed. Consumers want to buy from someone who cares about their needs. People do business with the people they trust, and they trust the people they know.
* A megatrend in today's business world involves going to extreme effort to meet consumer needs. Organizations can not afford to lose customers. It is always easier to sell to a satisfied customer than an unsatisfied one. The cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than keeping a present customer.
* The textbook focuses on taking care of the customer through exceptional customer service. **Service means making a contribution to the welfare of others. Salespeople exist to help others.**

### New Additions, Expansions, and Reexamination to this Edition
* Using this textbook each year in my sales classes has resulted in a constant study of the text by students who provide feedback on its content. Present users of the textbook have offered detailed critiques providing direction for revision of the book, as have the reviewers noted in the Acknowledgements. For this edition, I carefully reread the book to ensure that the text better reflects my thoughts and ideas on the subject. The relationships and interactions in the various steps of the selling process have been carefully examined to form a more seamless flow from one chapter to the next, and special emphasis is placed on the importance of ethical behavior in working with prospects and customers.
* ABC's of Selling trains readers on a specific, yet generic, step-by-step selling process that is universal in nature. Once learned, a student has the basic background to sell any product. Arguably, no other personal selling textbook presents a sales process or system in a logical sequence: from planning and the approach, to closing and follow-up for exceptional customer service. Scores of sales personnel in thee industry today comment on how this textbook reflects what they do on sales calls with prospects and customers. The goal of ABC's of Selling has always been to demonstrate to students the order of steps within the selling process; provide numerous examples of what should be in each step; and explain how the steps within the selling process interact with one another. If students understand the sales system by the end of the course, the class has successfully contribute to their eduction.

### Examples of New Additions
* ABC's of Selling is a market leader in sales classes worldwide, and its materials can be found in four international versions. Numerous sales trainers around the globe use our selling process to prepare their salespeople.

### The Uniqueness of ABC's of Selling
8 The appendix to Chapter 1, "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson," reveals this textbook's unique central focus--serving others unselfishly. To aid in this message, the acclaimed worldwide Golden Rule was incorporated in order to stress treating others as you would like to be treated in the marketplace and workplace.
* The textbook's foundation is based upon service. **Its cornerstone is love (caring) of others.** ABC's of Selling's values are supported by the pillars of an organization's--and individual's--integrity, trustworthiness, and character. The center of business and personal life revoles around personal interactions; as a result, a theme of this textbook is that ethical service, based upon truth between people, build strong long-term relationships.
* ABC's of Selling seeks to prepare people for the 21st century's demand for moral and ethical treatment--a universal declaration for human rights. It is a calling for a higher standard than what previously exists in many organizations worldwide. The General Assembly of the United Unations has proclaimed that humans possess reason and conscience, and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood. **Organizations should not be engaged in war within the marketplace, but committed to serving humanmind.**
* Many people seem to separate their personal life from their business life. Some individuals, when entering the business world, tend to follow the example of others to generate sales. The use of this textbook in your classroom may provide some students with a final opportunity to discuss how to enter the rat race without becoming a rat.

### ABC's Approach
* ABC's of Selling was conceived as a method of providing ample materials that allow readers to construct their own sales presentations after studying the text. This allows the instructor the flexibility of focusing on the "how-to-sell" approach within the classroom. Covering the basic foundations for understanding the concepts and practices of selling in a practical, straightforward, and readable manner, it provides students with a guide to use in preparing sales presentations and role-playing exercises.

### The Philosophy behind This Book
* The title should help you understand the philosophy of this book. A student of sales should understand the fundamentals--the basics--of personal selling. All of them. I do not advocate one way of selling as the best route to success. There are many roads to reaching one's goals.
* I do feel a salesperson should have an assortment of selling skills and should be very knowledgeable, even an expert, in the field. Based on the situation, the salesperson determines the appropriate actions to take for a particular prospect or customer. No matter what the situation, however, the basic fundamentals of selling can be applied.
* There is no place in our society for high-pressure, manipulative selling. The salesperson is a problem solver, a helper, and an advisor to the customer. **If the customer has no need, the salesperson should accept that and move on to help another person or firm.** If the customer has a need, however, the salesperson should and must go for the sale. **All successful salespeople I know feel that once they determine that the customer is going to buy someone's product--and that their product will satisfy that customer's needs--it is their job to muster all their enter, skill, and know-hwo to make that sale. That is what it's all about!**
* It is my sincere hope that after the reader has studied this book, he or she will say, "There's a lot more to selling than I ever imagined." I hope many people will feel that this material can help them earn a living and that selling is a great occupation and career.
* At the end of the course, I hope all the students will have learned how to prepare and give a sales presentation by visually, verbally, and nonverbally communicating their message. I know of no other marketing course whose class project is so challenging and where so much learning takes place.
* Finally, I hope each student realizes that these new communication skills can be applied to all aspects of life. Once learned and internalized, selling skills will help a person be a better commnicator throughout life.

### Basic Organization of the Book
* The publisher and I work hard to ensure that ABC's of Selling would provide students with the basic foundation for understanding all major aspects of selling. The 14 chapters in the text are divided into four parts:

        * Selling as a profession. Emphasizes the history, career, rewards, and duties of the professional salesperson and illustrates the importance of the sales function to the organization's success. It also examines the social, ethical, and legal issues in selling.
        * Preparation for Relationship Selling. Presents the background information salespeople use to deveolop their sales presentations
        * The Relationship Selling Process. At the heart of this book, this part covers the entire selling process from prospecting to follow-up. State-of-the-art selling strategies, practices, and techniques are presented in a "how-to" fashion.
        * Time and Territory Management: Keys to Success. The importance of the proper use and management of one's time and sales territory is given through coverage.

### Special to This Edition
* Ethics Emphasized. Unselfish and ethical service to the customer underscores the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--a sales philosohpy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated without expecting reciprocity. This is how to build long-term relationships with customers.
* The Tree of Business Life Icon. Beginning with Chapter 1, The Tree of Business Life icon is used to remind the reader of one the main themes of the book. This theme emphasizes that by providing ethical service you build true relationships. This section was developed in hopes of having the reader consider how a salesperson would incorporate ethical service into the chpater's topic.
* The Golden Rule Icon. The Golden Rule icon appears in each chapter to help reinforce the Tree of Business Life. The combination of the Golden Rule and the "Tree" guidelines for business and selling forms the core theme of this textbook. Unselfishly treating prosepcts/customers as you would like to be treated without expecting something in return results in ethical service that builds true long-term relationships. If you think about it, this is how you build true personal friends. Why not build your business relationships on this rock?
* Video cases. Cases 2.1, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5A, 7.3, 10.3, 12.4, 13.3 can be used independently or with eight of the videos accompanying this book. Each of the eight cases highlights a tough ethical dilemma often faced by sales personnel in today's competitive marketplace. use any of all of these cases to emphasize ethics in your sales class.
* Sales Call Role-Plays and ProSelling Videos. The first three of the four role-plays in Appendix A at the back of this book have videos created incorporating our selling process. The two people featured in the three role-plays completed my selling course. The professional selling materials in Chapter 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 do a great job in illustrating. Actually usedf in my classes by hundreds of students, these role-plays are created from information used by today's top sales forces.
* Sell Yourself on a Job Interview. The all-time favorite role-play is in Appendix B with other expierential exercises. For years I have used this student pleaser in both my personal selling and sales management classes. When students see themselves on video, they quickly realize what needs to be done for a professional interview. You have to try this exercise one time.
* Student Application Learning Exercises (SALES). Chapters directly related to creating the role-play have SALES that aid students in better understanding how to construct this popular class project. These were first used in my classes in the fall of 1997. Students unaimously felt they were great in helping them correctly construct their role-plays. SALES appear at the end of Chapters 3, 5A, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
* Sales Careers. Career information has been expanded throughout so students will better understand that there are sales jobs in all organizations--business, service, and nonprofit
* Selling Experiential Exercises. These end-of-chapter exercises help students better understand themselves and/or the text material. Many can be done in class or completed outside and discussed in class.
* Selling Globally Appendix. Many of these were writen by friends and colleagues from countries around the world. They are at the back of the book.
* Technology in Selling. A central theme within each chapter shows the use of technology and automation in selling and servicing prospects and customers.

FACING A SALES CHALLEGE
* Debra Hutchins majored in French, with a minor in English literature, at Washiongton University in St. Louis. After graduation she began working as a secretary in the marketing department at Sunwest Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
* "I had never considered a sales job while in school, and sales didn't appeal to me when I began work at the bank. I always felt you would have to be an extrovert. I'm more the shy, intellectual type. I don't see myselfin the role of a salesperson.
* "Someday I do want a more challenging job. I'm a very hard worker, long hours don't bother me. I've always had a need to achieve success. One of the things I like about being a secretary is helping customers when they call the bank. It is important tocarefully listen to their problems or what they want in order to provide good customer service. Maybe one day I'll find a job that has more challenge, professionalism, and reward."
* If youwere in Debra's position, what would you do? What types of jobs would you recommend she consider?

```

* Debra Hutchins is like many people in that while she was in school a career in sales did not seem like the thing to do. Most people are unfamiliar with what salespeople do.
* As you learn more about the world of sales, a career selling goods or services may become appealing. The salesperson makes valuable contribution to our quality of life by selling goods and services that benefit individual and industry. Red Motley, former editor of Parade magazine, once said, "Nothing happens until somebody sells something." Selling brings in the money and causes cash registers across the country to ring. For centuries, the salespeople of the world have caused goods and services to change hands.
* More than ever, today's salespeople are a dynamic power in the business world. They generate more revenue in the U.S. economy than workers in any other profession. The efforts of salespeople have a direct impact on such diverse areas as these:

        * Ensuring the success of new products
        * Keeping existing products on the retailer's shelf
        * Constructing manufacturing facilities
        * Opening businesses and keeping them open
        * Generating sales orders that result in the loading of trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, andpipelines that carry goods to customer all over the world.

* The salesperson is engaged in a highly honorable, challenging, rewarding, and professional career. In this chapter, you are introduced to the career, rewards, and duties of the salesperson. The chapter begins by reltaing an organization's business purpose to its marketing efforts.

## What is the Purpose of Business?
* **The purpose of business is to increase the general well-being of humandkind through the sales of goods and services.** This requires making a profit in order to operate the business and provide beneficial products to the marketplace. Profit is a means to an end. Reduced t obasics, businesses have two major functions: production of goods or creation of services and marketing those goods and services.

## The Primary Goal of Business
* The primary goal of business should be to transform the marketplace and workplace into an environment where everyone is  treated as they would like to be treated. Business should be fair to all parties involved in both the buying and selling of goods and services.

## Marketing's Definition
* There are numerous definition of marketing. Your book will use the American Marketing Association's definition:

        Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.

* The **marketing concept** is a business philosophy that says the customers' want-satisfaction is the economic and social jkustification for a firm's existence. Consequently, all company activities should be devoted to determining customers' wants and then satisfying them, while still making a profit.


## Essentials of a Firm's Marketing Effort
* The essentials of a firm's marketing effort include its ability 1) to determine the needs of its customers and 2) to create and maintain an effective marketing mix that satisfy customer needs. As shown in Exhibit 1.1, **a firm's marketing mix consists of four main elements--product, price, distribution or place, and promotion**--a marketing manager uses to market goods and services. It is the marketing manager's responsibility to determine how best to use each element in the firm's marketing efforts.

## Product: It's More than You Think
* A **good** is a physical object that can be purchased. A radio, a house, and a car are examples of a good. A **service** is an action or activity done for others for a fee. Lawyers, plumbers, teachers, and taxicab drivers perform services. **The term product refers to both goods and services**.
* So, what is a product? When you think of a product, most likely you imagine some tangible object you can touch, such as a radio or automobile. However, there is more to a product than you think.
* A **product** is a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes, including packagin, color, and brand, plus the services and even the reputation of the seller. People buy more than a set of physical attributes. They buy want-satisfaction such as what the product will do, its quality, and the image of owning the product.

## Price: It's Important to Success
* The corporate marketing department also determines each product's initial price. This process involves establishing each product's normal price and possible special discount prices. Since product price often is critical to customers, it is important part of the marketing mix. **Price** refers to the value of worth of a product that attracts the buyer to exchange money or something of value for the product.

```

    * Trade shows

```

## Distribution: It has to be Available
* The marketing manager also determines the best method of distributing the product. Distribution refers to the channel structure used to transfer products from an organization to its customers. It is important to have the product available to custoemrs in a convenient and accessible location when they want it.

## Promotion: You have to Tell People about it
* Promotion, as part of the marketing mix, increases company sales by communicating product information to potential custoemrs. The four basic parts of a firm's promotional effort are 1) personal selling, 2) advertising, 3) public relations, and 4) sales promotion. Example of each marketing mix ingredient are shown in Exhibit 1.2. The company's sales force is one segment of the firm's promotional effort. Salespeople are part of the organization's sales force. So what is the job of the salesperson?

## What is Selling
* Many people consider selling and marketing synonymous terms. However, selling is actually only one of the many marketing components. In business, a traditional definition of personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to persuade a prospective customer to buy something--a good, service, idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.
* This definition of selling involves a person helping another person. The salesperson often works with prospects or customers to examine their needs, provide information, suggest a product to meet their needs, and provide after-the-sale service to ensure long-term satisfaction.
* The definition also involves communications between seller and buyer. **The salesperson and the buyer discuss needs and talk about the product relative to how it will satisfy the person's needs. If the product is what the person needs, then the salesperson attempts to persuade the prospect to buy it.
* Unfortunately this explanation of personal selling does not explain the best selling philosohpy for the 21st century. Why?

## Personal Selling Today
* In the early 2000s the worst side of American business became obvious. Corporate corruption, misstated financials, and the personal profit of chief executives as their companies went out of business all contributed to the public's negative attitude toward most, if not all, business professions. Unethical business practices resulted in bankruptcies, which in turn led to massive layoffs across the country. This had an impact on all Americans and their families, leaving no person or organization untouched.

## How Some Salespeople are Viewed
* Each year, from 1977 to 2001, Gallup (one of America's leading pollsters) has found that insurance salespeople, advertising practitioners, and used car salespeople are the three lowest-rated job categories on perceived honesty and ethical standards. Which of the three would you say rated the lowest each year? Yes, it was the used car salesperson! Unfortunately, people tend to generalize from such research findings that most salespeople are not honest or ethical, which is not the case. I know used car salespeople with the highest of ethical standards. Be careful in making a hasty decision about salesperson. You cannot judge a book by its cover. You may be dealing with a sheep in wolf's clothing.

## What about You?
* How do you view the honesty and ethical standards of today's businesses and salespeople? For the last several years, at the beginning of my classes, I have asked sales students the following three questions on a poll found on my website:

        1. What does the general public think about salespeople? Only 10 percent of the almost 2,000 respondents had a positive attitude
        2. What do you think about salespeople? Thirty-five percent had a positive attitude
        3. After graduation, would you accept a sales job? Forty-five percent said "yes".

* These percentage do not represent high marks from my students. What are your answers to these three questions?
* What would you say is the number one reason for salespeople's low ratings on honesty and ethics? It is trust. Many people feel they may not be able to trust a salesperson. Why? Greed is often the answer! The love of money is the root of all kinds of problems. From the least of us to the greatest, we all seem to be greedy to some extent, and greed can make some people blind to all else around them. Given all that has gone on in America as we are revising this textbook, we will use a different definition of selling in your book from the traditional view. This difference is very important given the present status of business in America and the public's--maybe even your--view of salespeople.

### A New Definition of Personal Selling
* The new deinition inserts the word unselfish into the traditional definition discussed earlier. it is that simple! **Personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to unselfishly persuade a prospective customer to buy somethin--a good, a service, an idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.**
* This definition of selling involves the many things we discussed before, such as a person helping another person through selling. However, when the word unselfishly is added to the definition, it makes a big difference in how someone might look at selling. The word unselfish tells salespeople to be caring toward customers and to serve--help--the person or organization without expecting to get something in return. If you are still wondering about the "unselfish" approach to selling, think of the analogy of selling to your grandmother.

### Think of Your Grandmother
* Think of your, or your best friend's, grandmother. Would you treat her in a selfish manner? Would you sell her something just to make a sale? No way! You would not take advantage of Granny. Salespeople should handle their customers with unselfish and ethical service. How are you going to build a long-term relationship with customers unless you treat them unselfishly by placing their interests first?
* **Tell the truth about what the product will do, give the best price on the best product for the need, deliver on time, and provide outstanding follow-up service to make sure the customer is delighted with the purchase. If it is not the right product for the need expressed, tell the customer. If she or he still wants to buy--sell it to the customer!** After all, you, the saleperson, may be wrong.
* Or would you walk away from the sale as Ann Coombs did with a prospect? The chief executive officer (CEO) of a multinational bank wanted to hire her to boost the productivity of his New York staff--a group of people who were struggling to copy after escaping their World Trade Center offices on September 11, 2001. Ann told the CEo that in order to fix it, she had to know what these people were feeling--they had to be able to talk openly about their grief. The CEO wanted absolutely no discussion of fear or grieving. Coombs says it was a six-figure contract. She turned it down because she felt employees were not being treated as they should be treated.
* What would you do? Sell someone something you feel they do not need or refuse to make the sale? That is what salepeople face in their jobs. Oh, a few months later Ann Coombs was contracted to work with the Bush administration to help government department deal with the post-September 11,2001, world. She took that job!

### The Golden Rule of Personal Selling
* When asked, "What would you like to learn in this course?" Steven Osborne, a student in my personal selling class, said, "I would like to know how to believe in a profession that many people do not trust." I sincerely hope you will be a believer in the value of sales integrity at the end of this sales course and be able to give Steven a positive perspective.
* Part of your answer will involve your understanding the definition of personal selling discussed earlier and the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. A rule is a prescribed guide for conduct or action. The **Golden Rule of Personal Selling** refers to the sales philosophy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated. Reciprocity is not expected. Read the short essay at the back of this chapter in the Appendix titled "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson". This short story illustrates the importance of helping people through our jobs and our lives.
* Exhibit 2.7 in Chapter 2 provides examples of how people around the world view the Golden Rule. As you study the vaiours statements of the Golden Rule in Exhibit 2.7, be sure to note that all are phrased negatively except one--the last one. The negative form would teach behavior in this way: If you do not like to get cheated in a purchase, don't cheat others. The positive form, on the other hand, would say that if you like to receive the best price, then offer the best price to your customers.
* To help you understand the concept better, consider how the Golden Rule applies to a litter of kittens. one child watched in delight as the tiny kittens snuggled together, in the cardboard box where hercat had just delivered the litter. "Aw, isn't that cute?" She exclaimed. "They love each other so much that they're trying to keep each other warm." "Well not exactly", relied her mother. "Actually they're trying to keep themselves warm". The Golden Rule is all about trying to keep somebody else warm, even if it means that we get cold in the process. Stop a minute and think about how this applies to your life and the business world. This important concept will be applied to personal selling throughout the textbook. It is especially effective in explaining differences in salespeople and why so many people may have a negative view of some salespeople and a positive view of other salespeople.

### Salesperson Difference
* Garry Smith, a former consumer goods sales manager, and your author illustrate some of the differences between salespeople's approaches to personal selling today. In general, Exhibit 1.3 shows that differences can be explained by the extent of the person's self-interest. As Gallup's survey poll of Americans indicates, people view traditional salespeople as having their self-interest as a priority. This type of salesperson is preoccupited with his or her well-being--usually defined in terms of making money--and thus is selfish and can not be trusted.
* The salesperson following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. However, places the interests of others before self-interest. Professional salespeople fall somewhere in between the traditional and Golden Rule salesperson in terms of how they view prospects and customers. As Exhibit 1.3 illustrates, as interest in serving others improves, a person's self-interest lessens. The more the salesperson considers the customer's interest, the better customer service.

```
Exhibit 1.3: Interest in serving the customer improves as our self-interst decreases

1. Traditional Salespeople
    * Do what they think they can get away with
    * Guided by self-interests
    * Attribute results to personal efforts
    * Seek recognition for efforts; sharing not important. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is life's main motivator

2. Professional Salespeople
    * Do what they are legally required to do.
    * Take care of customers
    * Attribute results to personal efforts, employer, customers, economy
    * Enjoy recognition, may share if it suits their purpose. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is important, but not to the customer's detriment

3. Golden Rule Salespeople
    * Do the right thing
    * Find others' interests most important
    * Attribute results to others.
    * Feel that an individual's performance is due to others, thus not motived by pride and ego.
    * Service most important, money is to be shared.


```

### Everybody Sells
* If you think about it, everyone sells. From an early age, you develop communication techniques for trying to get your way in life. You are involved in selling when you want someone to do something. For example, if you want to get a date, ask for a pay increase, return merchandise, urge your professor to raise your grade, or apply for a new job, you are selling. You use personal communication skills to persuade someone to act. Your ability to communicate effectively is a key to success in life.
* This is why so many people take sales courses. They want to improve their communication skills to be more successful in both their personal and business lives. The skills and knowledge gained from a selling course can be used by a student who plans to go into virtually any field, such as law, medicine, journalism, the military, or his or her own business.
* Selling is not just for salespeople; it is a must for everyone. In today's competitive environment, where good interpersonal skills are so valued, the lack of selling capability can put anyone at a disadvantage. So as you reat this book and progress through the course, think about how you can use the material both personally and in business.

### What Salespeople are Paid to Do
* In the short term, on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, salespeople are paid to sell--that is their job. When a sales manager sees one of her salespeople, the question is always, "Did you sell anything today?" Salespeople need to sell something "today" to meet the performance goals for:

        * Themselves, in order to serve others, earn a living, and keep their job
        * Their employer, because without the generation of revenues the company fails and thus can not serve others.
        * Their customers, because their products help customers fulfill their needs and help their organization grow.

* In the long run--month to month, year to year--salespeople must build positive long-term relationships with their customers. Why? Because they know, and now you know, that up to 80 percent or more of the future sales of many organizations come from present customers and customer referrals.
* salespeople need to close sales and at the same time maintain a great relationship with the buyer. Think about that last sentence. It is a very important thing to understand and learn. Salespeople want to sell to their present customers today, more tomorrow, and even more the day after that. How do you sell someone something and remain his or her business friend? You need to know how the Golden Rule of Personal Selling applies to the sales job. That is what this textbook is about.

### Why Choose a Sales Career
* Six major reasons for choosing a sales career are 1) service to others; 2) the wide variety of sales jobs available, 3) the freedom of being on your own; 4) the challenge of selling; 5) opportunity for advancement in a company; and 6) the rewards from a sales career

### Service: Helping Others
* When asked what she will look for in a career after graduating from college, a student of your author's, Jackie Pastrano, said, "I'd like to do sommething that helps other people." The sales career provides the opportunity for service and an emotional purpose in life gained from helping others. That is why this book's central core value is "service". Service is a major reason for choosing a sales career. For many, service is the number one reason.
* Service refers to making a contribution to the welfare of others. All of us want to do what Jackie hopes to do--help others! Would you like to help others? There are million of sales jobs and thus many opportunities to help people and organizations.

### A Variety of Sales Job Are Available
* As members of a firm's sales force, salespeople are a vital element in the firm's effort to market goods and services profitably. Personal selling accounts for major expenditures by most companies and presents a large number of career opportunities. There are millions of sales jobs, and the probability that at one time during your life you will have a sales job is high.
* There are also hundreds, maybe thousands, of different types of sales positions. Think about this! Almost every good and service you know of has a salesperson who sells it to one or more people in order to get the product to the final user. That is why so many sales jobs are available.

### Types of Sales jobs--Which is for You?
* Although there are numerous specific types of sales jobs, most salespeople work in one of three categories: as a retail salesperson, a wholesale salesperson, or a manufacturer's sales representative. These categories are classified according to the type of products sold and the salesperson's type of employer.

### Selling in Retail
* A retail salesperson sells goods or services to consumers for their personal, nonbusiness use. Retail selling is so important to a society that this book has numerous examples of it. Three common types of sellers who sell at retail are the 1) in-store salesperson, 2) direct seller who sells face-to-face away from a fixed store location, and 3) telephone salesperson.
* Look back at the definition of a retail salesperson. Think of all the different types of retail organizations selling something--retails such as bakeries, banks, caters, hotels, video stores, and travel agents, and stores selling clothes, electronics, flowers, food, and furniture. Each customer contact person takes your money and provides a good or service in return. Customer contact person is another name for a salesperson. **Although the title may be different, the job is the same--to help you buy.**
* **Direct sellers** sell face-to-face to consumers--typically in their homes--who use the products for their person use. An organization could have one salesperson or 3 million salespeople, like Amway.
* As in any type of job--including accountants, mechanics, and politicians--some retail salespeople do very little to help their customers. However, many retail salespeople are highly skilled professionals, commanding exceptionally high incomes fro their ability to service their customers. I personally know retail salespeople earning 40,000 a year selling shoes; 80,000 selling furniture, 110,000 selling jewelry, and 150,000 selling automobiles.

### Selling for a Wholesaler
* Wholesaler (also called distributors) buy products from manufacturers and other wholesalers and sell to other organizations. A wholesale salesperson sells product to parties for:

        * Resale, such as groccery retailers buying items and selling to consumers
        * use in producing other goods or services, such as a home builder buying electrical and plumbing supplies
        * Operating an organization, such as your school buying supplies

* Firms engaged in wholesaling are called wholesaling middlemen. Classifying wholsaling middlemen is difficult because they vary greatly in 1) the products they sell, 2) the markets to which they sell, and 3) their methods of operation. As there are so many different types, the discussion of types of wholesalers is beyond the scope of this book.

### Selling for a Manufacturer
* Manufacturers' salespeople work for organizations producing the product. The types of **manufacturer's sales representative** positions range from people who deliver milk and bread to the specialized salesperson selling highly technical industrial products. The salesperson working for a manufacturer may sell to other manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, or directly to consumers. There are five main types of manufacturer sales positions:

        1. An account representative calls on a large number of already establish customers in, for example, the food, textile, and apparel industries. This person asks for the order.
        2. A detail salesperson concentrates on performing promotional activities and introducing new products rather than directly soliciting orders. The medical detail salesperson seeks to persuade doctors, the indirect customers, to specify a pharmaceutical company's trade name product for prescriptions. The actual sales is ultimately made through a wholesaler or directly to pharmacists and hospitals that fill prescriptions.
        3. A sales engineer sells products that call for technical know-how and an ability to discuss technical aspects of the product. Expertise in identifying, analyzing, and solving customer problem is another critical factor. This type of selling is common in the oil, chemical, machinery, and heavy equipment industries because of the t echnical nature of their products.

        Greg Munoz, a sales engineer for the Dow Chemical Company, says,

        Our sales technique typically takes the team approach. Several of Dow's finest staff (technical, production, marketing, and support) and I work in unison to address the customer's specific needs. I am responsible for building the business relationship with the customer and directing resources and information toward securing a customer's plastic-resin business. Market managers and district sales managers coordinate pricing and positioning as the customer relates to the industry as a whole. Dow technicians engineer materials to meet or exceed the requirements specified for the application and work with the customer's production department to see that they perform accordingly. Customer service representatives handle order placement and product-delivery logistics while servicing the customer's information needs. Once the sale is closed, I follow up and maintain our profile while serving as the first line of communication and interface for the customer

        4. An industrial products salesperson, nontechnical, sells a tangible product to industrial buyers. No high degree of technical knowledge is required. Packaging materials manufacturers and office equipment sales representatives are nontechnical salespeople.

        5. A service salesperson, unlike the four preceding types of manufacturing salespeople, must sell the benefits of intangible or nonphysical products such as financial, advertising, or computer repair services. Services, like goods, are either technical or nontechnical in nature.

* Selling services is ordinarily more difficult than selling tangibles. The salesperson can show, demonstrate, and dramatize tangible products; the salesperson of intangible product can not. Intangibles often are difficult for the prospect to comprehend. People can not feel, smell, see, hear, or taste intangible products. This makes them more challenging to sell.

### Order-Takers versus Order-Getters
* Sales jobs vary widely in their nature and requipments. Some sales jobs require the salesperson only to take orders. **Order-takers** may ask what the customer wants or wait for the customer to order. They do not have a sales strategy and often use no sales presentation. Order-takers must be employed to bring in additional business that the employer probably would not obtain without their efforts. many never attempt to close the sale. They perform useful service. However, few truly create sales.
* On the other hand, the creative selling of tangible goods or intangible services in highly competitive lines (or where the product has no special advantage) moves merchandise that can not be sole in equal volume without a salesperson. These people are **order-getters**. They get new and repeat business using a creative sales strategy and a well-executed sales presentation. The salesperson has an infinitely more difficult selling situation than that faced by the order-taker. In this sense, the individual is a true salesperson, which is why this person usually earns so much more than the order-taker.
* **This salesperson has two selling challenges. First, the salesperson must often create discontent with what the prospect already has before beginning to sell constructively. Second, the salesperson often has overcome the most powerful and obstinate resistance. For example, the prospect may never have heard of the product and, at the outset, may have no desire whatsoever to purchase it. The prospect may even be prejudiced against it and may resent the intrusion of this stranger. In other instances, the prospect may want it but may want competing products more. Frequently, the prosepct can not afford it. To meet such sales situations successfully requires creative selling of the highest order.**
* Creative salespeople often are faced with selling to numerous people to get one order. This is the most difficult selling situation beccause the representative **may have to win over not only the decision maker, the one who can say yes, but also other persons who can not approve the order but who have the power to veto.**

### Freedom of Action: You're on Your Own
* A second reason why people choose a sales career is the freedom it offers. A sales job provides possibly the greative relative freedom of any career. Experienced employees in outside sales usually receive little direct supervision and may go for days, even weeks, without seeing their bosses.
* Job duties and sales goals are explained by a manager. Salespeople are expected to carry out their job duties and achieve goals with minimum guidance. They usually leave home to contact customers around the corner or around the world.

### Job Challenge is Always There
* Working alone with the responsibility of a territory capable of generating thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars in revenue for your company is a personal challenge. This environment adds great variety to a sales job. Salespeople often deal with hundreds of different people and firms over time. it is much like operating your own business, without the burdens of true ownership.

### Opportunities for Advance are Great
* Successful salespeople have many opportunities to move into top management positions. in many instances, this advancement comes quickly.
* A sales personnel career path, as Exhibit 1.7 depicts, is the upward sequence of job movements during a sales career. Occasionally, people without previous sales experience are promoted into sales management positions. However, 99 percent of the time, a career in sales management begins with an entry-level sales position. Firms believe that an experienced sales professional has the credibility, knowledge, and background to assume a higher position in the company.
* Most companies have two or three successive levels of sales positions, beginning at the junior or trainee level. Beginning as a salesperson allowes a person to:

        * Learn about the attitudes and activities of the company's salespeople
        * Become familiar with customer attitude toward the company, its products, and its salespeople.
        * Gain firsthand knowledge of products and their application, which is most important in technical sales.
        * Become seasoned in the business world

```
Exhibit 1.7: A sales personnel career path
sales trainee->salesperson->key account salesperson->District sales manager->Regional sales manager->Divisional sales manager->National sales manager->Vice president of marketing->President

```

* When asked why they like their jobs, first line sales managers say it is because of the rewards. By rewards, they mean both financial rewards and nonfinancial rewards, such as the great challenge and the feeling of making a valuable contribution to their salespeople and the company. Managers also frequently mention that this position represents their first major step toward the top. They have made the cut and are on the management team. Instead of having responsibility for 1 million in sales, as a salesperson does, the manager is responsible for 10 million.
* With success, various jobs throughout the sales force and in the corporate marketing department open up.  This can include sales training, sales analysis, advertising, and product management. Frequently, traveling the upward career path involves numerous moves from field sales to corporate sales, back to the field, then to corporate, back to the field, and so on. However, sales experience prepares people for more responsible jobs in the company.
* Success also creates financial rewards. The larger a company's revenues, the heavier the responsibility of the chief executive, and teh large the compensation. Today, it's common for a CEO of a large national corporation to receive compensation totaling more than 1 million annually.
* Leaving aside compensation at the top echelons, both corporate and field sales managers typically receive higher salaries than others (such as production, advertising, product, or personnel managers) at the same organizational level. Salary extended vacation and holiday periods; pension programs; health, accident, and legal insurance programs; automobiles and auto expenses; payment of professional association dues; educational assistance for themselves and sometimes for their families; financial planning assistance; company airplanes; home and entertainment expenses; and free country club membership. The higher the sales position, the greater the benefits offered. In addition to performance, salary typically is related to the following factors:

        * Annual sales volume of units managed.
        * Number of salespeople managed
        * Length of experience in sales
        * Annual sales volume of the firm

### Rewards: The Sky's the Limit
* As a salesperson, you can look forward to two types of rewards--nonfinancial and financial.

##### Nonfinancial Rewards
* Sometimes called psychological income or intrinsic rewards, nonfinancial rewards are generated by the individual, not given by the company. You know the job has been done well--for instance, when you have helped the buyer through the purchase of your product.
* Successfully meeting the challenges of the job produces a feeling of self-worth. You realize your job is important. Everyone wants to feel good about their job, and a selling career allows you to experience these good feelings and intrinsic rewards daily. Salespeople often report that the nonfinancial rewards of their jobs are just as important to them as financial rewards.
* After training, a salesperson is often given responsibility for a sales territory. The person then moves into a regular sales position. In a short time, the salesperson can earn the status and financial rewards of a senior sales position by contacting the larger, more important customers. Some companies refer to this function as a key account sales position.

### There are Two Career Paths
* Don't let Exhibit 1.7 mislead you--many salespeople prefer selling over managing people. They want to take care of themselves rather than others. In some companies, a salesperson may earn more money than even the manager, even the firm's president.
* Many companies recognize the value of keeping some salespeople in the field for their entire sales career. They do a good job, know their customers, and love what they are doing--so why promote them if they do not want to move up within the organization? However, many other people work hard to move into management.

### You Can Move Quickly into Management
* The first managerial level is usually the district sales manager's position. It is common for people to be promoted to this position within two or three years after joining the company. From district sales manager, a person may move into higher level of sales management.

### Financial Rewards
* Many are attracted to selling because in a sales career financial rewards are commonly based solely on performance. Many professional salespeople have opportunities to earn large salaries. Their salaries average even higher than salaries for other types of workers at the same organizational level.

### Is a Sales Career Right for You?
* It may be too early in life to determine if you really want to be a salesperson. The balance of this book will aid you in investigating sales as a career. Your search for any career begins with you. In considering a sales career, be honest and realistic. Ask your questions such as these:

        * What are my past accomplishments
        * What are my future goals
        * Do I want to have the responsibility of a sales job
        * Do I mind travel? How much travel is acceptable
        * How much freedom do I want in the job?
        * Do I have the personality characteristics for the job
        * Am I willing to transfer to another city? Another state?

Your answers to these questions can help you analyze the various types of sales jobs and establish criteria for evaluating job openings. Determine the industries, types of products or services, and specific companies in which you have an interest.
* College placement offices, libraries, and business periodicals offer a wealth of information on companies as well as sales positions in them. Conversations with friends and acquaintances who are involved within selling, or have been in sales, can give you realistic insight into what challenges, rewards, and disadvantages the sales vocation offers. To better prepare yourself to obtain a sales job, you must understand what companies look for in salespeople

### A Sales Manager's View of the Recruit
* The following discussion of what sales maanger consider when hiring a salesperson is based on a summary of a talk given by a sales manager to a sales class. It is reasonably representative of what companies look for when hiring salespeople

        We look for outstanding applicants who are mature and intelligent. They should be able to handle themselves well in the interview, demonstrating good interpersonal skills. They should have a well-thought-out career plan and be able to discuss it rationally. They should have a friendly, pleasing personality. A clean, neat appeanrance is a must. They should have a positive attitude, be willing to work hard, be ambitious, and demonstrate a good degree of interest in the employer's business field. They should have good grades and other personal, school, and business accomplishments. Finally, they should have clear goals and objectives in life. The more common characteristics on which applicants for our company are judged are 1) appearnace, 2) self-expression, 3) maturity, 4) personality, 5) experience, 6) enthusiasm, and 7) interest in the job

* People often consider sales career because they have heard that salespeople can earn good salaries. They think anyone can sell. T hese people have not considered all the facts. A sales job has high rewards because it also has many important responsibilities. Companies do not pay high salaries for nothing. As you will see in this book, a sales career involves great challenges that require hard work by qualified individuals. Let us review the characteristics of a successful salesperson.

### Success in Selling--What does it Take?
* Over the years, I have asked many salespeople and sales managers the question, "What helps make a salesperson successful?" The answer is contained in the words love, success, and person, as in the phrase "a person who loves success." As these words will indicate, to be a good salesperson today it helps to be a good person.
* As a student, I love phrases and acronyms to help me remember. That is why I use them here to help you remember and better understand what selling in today's business environment requires. As Exhibit 1.8 shows, the eight most frequently mentioned characteristics necessary to be successful in sales can be found in the words love and success. To help remember, think of the word ssuccess, spelled with four s's.

```

MAKING THE SALE

Don't Quit

        When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
        when the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
        When the funds are low and teh debts are high, 
        And you want to smile but you have to sigh,
        When care is pressing you down a bit--
        Rest if you must but don't you quit
        Life is queer with its twists and turns,
        As every one of us sometimes learns
        And many a person turns about
        When they might have won had they stuck it out
        Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
        You may succeed with another blow.
        Often the struggler has given up
        When he might have captured the victor's cup;
        And he learned too late
        When the night came down
        How close he was to the golden crown.
        Success is failure turned inside out--
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
        It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.

```

* **S--Success Begins with Love** The successful salesperson is an individual who loves selling, finds it exciting, and is strongly convinced that the product being sold offers something of great value. Of the eight work characteristics for sales success, love of selling is clearly number one. Love is at the center of success. It has been said that if you find a job you love, you will never work again

* **S--Service to Others** Today's salespeople make a contribution to the welfare of others through service. They are dream makers. They sell solutions to people's needs that make their dreams come true. Salespeople love to help others fulfill their needs through selling their products.

* **U--Use the Golden Rule of Selling** If salespeople do not know how to place the customer's needs first, how can they build a long-term relationship? People like to buy, not be sold. And they like to buy from people they know and trust. That is one reason today's salesperson needs to treat others as he or she would like to be treated.

* **C-Communication Ability** Good salespeople are good communicators. Great salespeople are great communicators. Whether it involves nonverbal or verbal communications, as discussed in Chapter 4, top salespeople speak the other person's language.

* **Characteristics for the Job** Can anyone be a successful salesperson? It helps to reach that goal if you possess the personal characteristics needed for a sales career. These characteristics are discussed after the remaining work characteristics are introduced. Let's continue our discussion of those work characteristics now.

* **E-Excels at Strategic Thinking** The sixth work characteristic is that high-performing salespeople tend to be strategic problem solvers for their customers. They can match their product's benefits with the customer's needs. Strategic customer sales planning is discussed more in Chapter 7.

* **S-Sales Knowledge at the M.D Level** Top professional salespeople have mastered the basic competencies of selling, which include product knowledge (see Chapter 5) and selling skills. As goods and services become more complex, companies place greater emphasis on training their salespeople and on salespeople training themselves. Salespeople must be experts on everything involved with their products, as a medical doctor is an expert. Remember, however, that knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch.

* **S-Stamina for the Challenge** Today's salesperson needs to be physically, mentally, and spiritually prepared to meet the daily challenges of a sales career. Body, mind, and soul play an important role in the level of a person's stamina. With physical preparedness comes mental strength. Exercise, for example, elevates your mood by increasing energy and simultaneously secreting adrenaline-like substances in the body that act as stimulants and antidepressants, according to the medical community. The increased feeling of well-being transmits itself to the body and mind. In this stressed-out world we all need stress relief. Exercise can help!
* Kenneth H. Cooper, MD, often referred to as the Fater of Aerobic, says, "it is easier to maintain good health through proper exercise, diet, and emotional balance than to regain it once is lost." Aerobic, strength training, and stretching are wonderful tool to reduce stress, help you feel better, focus better, and have more energy. If you are not actively using these techniques, try them for three months. Find out how exercise can help you! Be sure to check with you doctor before starting any exercise problem, though.
* For many people, personal spirituality or belief in a Supreme Being has a great impact upon physical and mental stamina and thus job performance. This is especially true if they feel their sales career is a calling. People's faith may direct everything they do on the job, ranging from how they treat customers to how ethically they act toward their employer.

* **C-Characteristics for the Job Examined** We skipped over the personal characteristics needed for a sales career earlier. Let's discuss them now. Certainly any discussion of what it takes to be successful in a sales job has to include the person's personal characteristics. As we have described selling, the salesperson wants to help people and thus build a long-term relationship. The question has been asked "How do you sell someone something and remain business friends?"
* In the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, his teacher tells Harry that it is not our ability that show who we truly are but our choices. A salesperson can choose to be like the traditional salesperson we all disparage or the salesperson who is truly people oriented.

* **Caring, Job, Harmony** The most important characteristic of a ssuccessful salesperson is a **caring** attitude--caring about the customer's best interest. Many Golden Rule salespeople mean "love" when they say caring. The two terms are interchangeable. They love, and thus care about, everything connected with their work and life. Without caring, it's difficult--if not impossible--to possess the other eight characteristics of a Golden Rule saesperson.
* There is great **joy** in truly caring for one's customers, and this job motivates a salesperson to care for customers continuously. Because the salesperson is concerned with what is best for the customer, there ise a sense of peace or **harmony** in the relationship. The custoemr can trust the salesperson, so all fear of being taken advantage of is removed.

* **Patience, Kindness, Moral Ethics** Salespeople are often under pressure to make the sales today! They need to be able to handle the pressure to sell now using **patience** in their working relationship with the customer. Let the customer decide when to buy instead of pressuring for a quick decision. A buyer needs information to make an educated decision. Often this takes time and great patience. Patience in closing the sale goes a long way toward building a long-term relationship. Buyers do not like to be pressured into making a quick decision. Do you? Neither do I! People like to buy, not be sold.
* Your actions speak louder than your words. People want to see you "walk the talk, not talk the talk." Having patience shows that the salesperson understands the customer's needs and wants to help. This is a display of **kindness**, a kind person is patient and compassionate. Salespeople must be kind to their customers in order to show that they aren't interested solely in making the sale. Remember, we are interested in following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--acting in the best interest of others, not just making sales. A salesperson who follow the Golden Rule is **morally ethical** individual whom the customer can trust.

* **Faithful, Fair, Self-Control** A salesperson who cares, likes the job, is good to work with, and is patient, kind, and morally ethical is certainly someone who will be **faithful** in taking care of customers. The salesperson will spend the time necessary to help, not just make the sale and never be heard from again until the next sales call. We all want to be thought of as ethical. Faithfulness is an ethical virtue. It shows the employer, customers, and competitors that the salesperson is **fair** to all. Customers can trust this salesperson.

* **Self-Control is Most Difficult** Now we come to **self-control**, which is the most difficult trait for a salesperson to develop. This is why we discuss it last. Self-control involves restraining our emotions, passions, and desires usually for self-gain. How do salespeople control themsevles by being patient in closing the sale, for example? Remember, the salesperson must sell to make a living and keep the job. Thus, there is considerable incentive for the salesperson to use pressure or lie, for example, to compel the customer to buy something that may not be needed or that is falsely represented.

* **Self-Control Involves Discipline** Self-control also refers to the needed discipline to rise early, work late, and prepare for the next day in the evening. Often the biggest challenge to success is not out there in the sales territory; it is within us. We can not achieve unless we are willing to pay the price--discipline.
* Discipline also includes creating time for family--parents, spouse, and children. So often we caught up in the American way of wanting to be rich and famous that we forgot about the others in our life. Instead we must discipline ourselves to set priorities. What comes first, your job or your family? For me, it should always be family before job. Setting priorities requires willpower many of us do not have. Do you ever wonder why t here are so many divorces in America and so many children raised in one-parent homes? Misplacing priorities by not putting family first is the number one contributor to the breakdown of American families. Self-control and discipline are thus very important personal characteristics for all of us, no matter what our careers.
As you see in Exhibit 1.10, the list of personal characteristics needed to be a good salesperson in today's marketplace is a long one. No doubht your instructor will add to this list, and you undoubtedly will think of other characteristics as well. These characteristics make salespeople good citizens in the business world. However, sadly, it seems that all of us do not have the ability or desire to place the customer first.

```
Exhibit 1.10: Personal Characteristics needed to sell for building long-term relationships

* Caring for custoemr
* Joy in work
* Harmony in relationship
* Patience in closing the sale
* Kind to people
* morally ethical
* Faithful to word
* Fairness in the sale[
* Self-control in emotions

```

* **One of the Kindest People** Many years ago a man named John Wesley, known as one of the kindest men who ever walked on earth, talked about a simple rule of life. Wesley said he tried to "Do all the good he can by all the means he can in all the places he can at all the times he can to all the people he can as long as ever he can" How would you like to deal with a salesperson who followed both Wesley's rule of life and the Golden Rule? Me too.


### Do Success Characteristics Describe You
* What do you think? Do these success characteristics describe you? Are you willing to incorporate them into your life? You may have to go beyond your normal limits. Only your self-imposed limitation can hold you back. If you fail to realize success or if your success is limited, your own preconceptions may be the cause by throwing an invisible barrier across your path. 

## Relationship Selling
* Salespeople are no longer adversaries who manipulate people for personal gain. They want to be consultants, partners, and problem solvers for customers. Their goal is to build a long-term relationship with clients. Salespeople seek to benefit their employer, themselves, and customers.
* In recent years, the distinction between a salesperson and a professional has blurred because the salesperson of today is a pro. Many salespeople know more about their field and product than the buyer. The expertise enables the seller to become the buyer's partner, a counselor on how to solve problems. Today's salesperson professionally provides information that helps customers make intelligent actions to achieve their short- and long-term objectives. Service and follow-up are then provided to ensure satisfaction with the purchase. This build customer loyalty--a relationship

## Facing a Sales Challange
* As the sales manager of a printing company, you are about to invest in a car leasting program that involves 18 company cars for your sales staff. Together with your comptroller, you have examined several leasing programs. You have narrowed down your selection to two leasing companies that offer very similar terms. You are meeting with the president of Equilease, a company with which you have never done business. You know from your own prospect files that one of your sales representatives has tried to call on the purchasing manager of Equilease before to get some of the company's printing business; however, he could not sell the account.
* As you meet with the president for lunch, you gently steer the conversation in the direction of printing services. Since he is very knowledgeable about printing services and prices, you ask him about ballpark prices charged by his existing sujpplier. You believe you could provide his company with high-quality service in a better price.
* Since the president of Equilease is in a good mood, you think about setting up a win-win situation. You are considering making this offer. Let's make this a double win. I'll give you 100 percent of our leasing business if you'll consider giving us 50 percent of your printing business. Fair enough?
* Is there an ethical conflict in this situation? Would it be ethical to propose such a deal?

---

* Sales personnel constantly are involved with social, ethical, and legal issues. Yet if you think about it, everyone is--including you. If you found a bag full of 100 bills lying on the side of the road, would you keep it? Would you say you were sick to get extra time off work? Would you use the company car to run a personal errand? Have you ever broken the speed limit? Have you ever gone home with one of your emnployer's pens in your purse or jacket pocket?
* These sorts of questions may be difficult to the average person to answer. Some people will respond with an unequivocal yes or no. Others may mull it over awhile. Still others may feel compelled to say "it depends" and qualify their response with a "yes, but..." or "no, but..." Maybe that was what you did with the Sales Challenge feature.
* Newspapers, radio, and television frequently have news stories of individuals and organizations involved in both good and bad practices. This chapter addresses many of the important social, ethical, and legal (SEL) issues in selling. It begins by discussing management's social responsibilities. Then it examines ethical behavior followed by the ethical issues involved in dealing with salespeople, employers, and consumers. The chapter ends by presenting ways an organization can help its sales personnel follow ethical selling practices.

## Social, Ethical, and Legal Influences
* An organization's environment is a major influence on how the firm sells its products. As pictured in Exhibit 2.1, social, ethical, and legal influences and considerations surround the firm's product, price, place, and promotion.
* Due to the environmental turmoil in the world of commerce, this chapter is arguably the most important in the entire book. Let's begin by asking, "Does an organization have any responsibilities to society?"


## Management's Social Responsibilities
* In one sense, the concept of corporate social responsibility is easy to understand; it means distinguishing right from wrong and doing right. It means being a good corporate citizen. The formal definition of social responsibility is management's obligation to make choices and take actions that contribute to the welfare and interests of society as well as to those of the organization.
* As straightforward as this definition seems, social responsibility can be difficult concept to grasp because different people have different opinions as to which actions improve society's welfare. To make matters worse, social responsibility convers a range of issues, many of which have ambiguous boundaries between right and wrong.

## Organizational Stakeholders
* One reason for the difficulty in understanding social responsibility is that managers must confront the question "responsibility to whom?" The organization's environment consists of several sectors both inside and outside the organization. From a social responsibility perspective, enlightened organizations view the internal and external environment as a variety of stakeholders.
* A **stakeholder** is any group within or outside the organization that has a stake in the organization's performance. Each stakeholder has a different interest in the organization.
* Exhibit 2.2 illustrates eight important stakeholders. These are represented by the acronym **CCC GOMES**. The first C refers to customers and the last S refers to suppliers. Owners' creditors', and suppliers' interests are served by managerial efficiency--that is, the use of resources to achieve profits. Managers and salespeople expect work satisfaction, pay, and good supervision. Customers and concerned with decisions about the quality and availability of goods and services.
* Other important stakeholders include the government and the community. Most corporations exist under the proper charter and licenses and operate within the limits of laws and regulations imposed by the government, including safety laws and environmental protection requirements. The community includes local government, the natural and physical environments, and the quality of life provided for residents. Socially responsible organizations pay attention of all stakeholders affected by their actions.

## An Organization's Main Responsibility
* Once a company is aware of its stakeholders, what are its main responsibilities to them? Comapnies have four types of responsibility: 1. economic, 2. legal, 3. ethical, 4. discretionary.


#### Economic Responsibilities
* The business institution is, above all, the basic economic unit of society. Its responsibility is to produce the goods and services that society wants and to maximize profits for its owners and shareholders.
* Quite often, corporations are said to operate solely to maximize profits. Certainly, profit is important to a firm, just as a grade point average is important to a student. Profit provides the capital to stay in business, to expand, and to compensate for the risk of conducting business. Businesses have a responsibility to make a profit to serve society. Imagine what would happen to our society if large corporations did not make a profit and went out of business. Thousands of people and the U.S. economy would be affected. This has happend in the last few years?

#### Legal Responsibilities
* All modern societies lay down ground rules, laws, and regulations that organizations are expected to follow. Legal responsibility defines what society deems as important with respect to appropriate corporate behavior. Organizations are expected to fulfill their economic goals within the legal framework. Legal requirements are imposed by local town councils, state legislators, and federal regulatory agencies.

#### Ethical Responsibilities
* Ethical responsibility includes behaviors that are not necessarily codified into law and may not serve the corporation's direct economic interests. To be thical, organizational decision makers should act with equity, fairness, and impartiality; respect the rights of individuals; and provide different treatment of individuals only when relevant to the organization's goals and tasks. Unethical behaavior occurs when decisions enable an individual or company to gain at the expense of society.

#### Discretionary Responsibilities
* Discretionary responsibility is purely voluntary and guided by a company's desire to make social contributions not mandated by economics, law, or ethics. Discretionary activities include generous philanthropic contributions that offer no monetary return to the company and are not expected.
* discretionary responsibility is the highest criterion of social responsibility, because it goes beyond societal expectations to contribute to the community's welfare. For example, Baxter International, a manufacturer and marketer of medical products, is using its environmental knowledge to help its customers to set up pollution-reduction and recycling programs. Baxter has even set up an alliance with Waste Management to better assist customers in handling environmental problems. Baxter also has studied its own products and packing to find ways to reduce waste. By reducing the waste created by its products, Baxter reduces the environmental problems of its customers.

## How to Demonstrate Social Responsibility
* A corporation can demonstrate social responsibility in numerous ways, including these:

                1. Taking corrective action before it is required
                2. Working with affected constituent to resolve mutual problems
                3. Working to establish industrywide standards and self-regulation
                4. Publicly admitting mistakes
                5. Getting involved in appropriate social programs
                6. Helping correct environmental problems
                7. Monitoring the changing social environment
                8. Establishing and enforcing a corporate code of conduct
                9. Taking needed public stands on social issues
                10. Striving to make profits on an ongoing basis.

* Economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities to stakeholders are important concerns organizations must face. Society is demanding more responsible action of organizations, particularly regarding their ethical conduct.

## What Influences Ethical Behavior
* Organizations are composed of individuals. These individuals' morals and ethical values help shape those of the organization. Critical to making decisions in an ethical manner is the individual integrity of the organization's managers, especially those in top management positions. Thus, two major influences on the ethical behavior of sales personnel are employees and the organization itself.

## The Individual's Role
* All of us, employees and managers alike, bring certain beliefs about the world to a job. These beliefs direct our daily decisions. This "big picture" view of life that directs our behavior is based upon our core belief system. It often is referred to as a person's "worldview".
* Personality, religious background, family upbringing, personal experience, and the situation faced are examples of factors shaping our core belief system. This is why you hear, "no two people are alike". Each one views the world differently than someone else. Your parents probably view many things differently than you do, for example.
* Because people have different beliefs about the world around them, referring to as a person's **worldview**, they tend to have different views on ethics and morality. From an early age, you begin a journey down a road to higher moral development. Research has shown that individuals grow or progress in their ability to understand the "truth" or the ability to show what is right or wrong. People's **moral** are their adherence to right or wrong behavior and right or wrong thinking. As one thinks, one does! That includes you and me.
* Over time moral development gradually matures in many people. With moral maturity many individuals--but not all--adhere to more truthful or stringent moral principles. Often a person's current moral development can be placed into one of the levels shown in Exhibit 2.4.

* **Level One: Preconventional**. At the preconventional moral development level, an individual acts in his or her own best interest and thus follows rules to avoid punishment or receive rewards. This individual would break moral and legal laws. In making an ethical or moral decision, a salesperson at this level might ask, "What can I get away with?"
* Some see them as moral infants with little capacity for self-insight because their genetially installed conscience has hardened over time. They do not see wrong in unethical behavior. If they do, it is rationalized in their favor and quickly forgotten. Whatever happens is someone else's fault.
* **LEvel Two: Conventional** At the conventional moral development level, an individual conforms to the expectations of others, such as family, friends, employer, boss, or society, and upholds moral and legal laws. A salesperson at this level might ask, "What am I legally required to do?" whenmaking an ethical or moral decision.
* **Level Three: Principled** At the principled moral development level, an individual lives by an internal set of morals, values, and ethics regardless of punishments or majority opinion. The individual would disobey orders, laws, and consequences to follow what he or she beliefs is right. This person follows the Golden Rule. When making an ethical or moral decision a salesperson at this level might ask, "What is the right thing to do".

* The majority of sales personnel, as well as people in general, operate at the conventional level. However, a few individuals are at level 1, and it is estimated that less than 20 percent of individual reach level 3.
* As shown in Exhibit 2.5e43, the majority (60 to 80 percent) of sales personnel, as well as people in general, behaves at the conventional level--level 2. However,, approximately 10 to 20 percent of the people behave at each of the other two levels--level 1 and 3. Within each level, there is a lower and higher level of moral development behavior. Some people at level 2, for example, have behavior closer to level 1 people or level 3 people.

## The Organization's Role
* If the vast majority of people in our society are at the preconventional or conventional level, it seems that most employees in an organization would feel they must "go along to get along"; in other words, they acquiesce to questionable ethical standards to keep their jobs. At most, they only follow formal policies and procedures.
* How will sales personnel handle ethical dilemmas? What if there are no policies and procedures pertaining to some sales practices and a superior directs the salesperson to do something that appears unethical? It is no wonder that radio, television, and newspaper reports frequently feature unethical business practices. Following the hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil philosophy can create a preconventional or conventional organizational climate.

## Are There Any Ethical Guidelines?
* The development of sales personnel's moral character can be crucial to a company. The Golden Rule of Selling requires people whose personal character is at level 3, who have caring attitudes and recognize the rights of others, and who act based on personal, independently defined universal principles of justice and values.

## What Does the Research Say?
* The question is, "What should an individual base her or his values upon?" In a Februrary 12, 2002, national poll, American adults said by a 3-to-1 margin that truth is always relative to a person's situation. People are most likely to make their moral and ethical decisions on the basis of whatever feels right or comfortable in a situation.

## What Does One Do?
* Do you face different situations regularly? If the situation is always changing, how do you make a decision over an ethical dilemma? For example, if you found 125,000 in cash that has fallen out of the armored truck at a local bank, would you return it to the bank? But if you found someone's wallet in a parking lot, would you feel compelled to turn it in to a lost-and-found or the police? Why would you decide to keep the 125,000 when you would most likely be willing to turn in the wallet witout taking any money from it? Out of class, it is all right to copy someone's homework assignment even when the course syllabus states you have to do your own work? What keeps you from copying on an exam when your professor is out of the room? With your boss's approval, is it all right to offer a customer a 10,000 trip if the customer purchases a 3 million order, even though it is against company policy? Why would you not even question doing so if a 20 lunch was associated with the purchase?

## Is Your Conscience Reliable?
* Almost every day you have to decide what is the correct thing to do in situations. We all have an internal ultimate moral standard we use to measure good and evil, right and wrong. Some people call that their "conscience". Most of us know we should return the 125,000 or wallet, not copy, or not give someone a bribe. But what would we actually do in these situation?
* A person in these situations may feel there is no way to get caught. You could ask the boss about the 10,000, she might say: "That's what you have to do to get the business. Everyone is doing it." Does that make it all right? Or your college friends cheat. What does it hurt if everyone does it?
* What if a person's value system is at the level 2 stage of moral development? This person makes decisions based upon the "situation" and what others, such as friends, family, boss, or competitors, say or do. A person may do the right thing in one situation after talking it over with her mother, yet take the wrong action in some other situation after talking with the boss. Usually people internally rationalize their actions by saying, for example, "I will copy the homework only this one time."
* Many people are so used to doing things unethically that they think nothing of it. For example, a woman received a telephone call from her husband's sales manager complaining that he was taking home company office supplies. In a rage his wife replied, "I don't believe that! Why does he do that? He knows I bring enough office supplies home from my job for the both of us."
* Yogi Berra, the retired great baseball player, is famous for saying, "When you come to a fork in the road, take it". When you come to a fork in the road, how do you know which road is the ethical one? Are your feelings about a situation an accurate measure of its rightness or wrongness? At times, I am not a good judge of what is best to do in a situation because the outcome involves something I want. Thus, I can not always trust my conscience.

## Sources of Significant Influence
* Think about the next question for a moment before reading on. What do you use to resolve ethical or moral dilemmas that occur in your life? In the margin, make a list of two or three factors that influence your choices when faced with an ethical or moral issue. What do you base your decisions upon? Do your decision factors include your frineds, family, or things you see on television on in the movies? Do their thoughts on what is ethical sometimes change from day to day?
* Barna Research is conducting an ongoing study of sources influencing Americans' ethical and moral decision-making processes. In early returns, Barna found the leading influencers in American society to be movies, television, the Internet, books, music, public policy and law, and family.
* Wouldn't it be nice to be able to base your decisions on something that never chagnes, something that can always be depended upon to provide the correct answer in any situation?
* It is said that Satan greets people in hell by saying, "You'll find that there's no right or wrong here, just what works for you!" Can business and salespeople make ethical choices based on whatever works for them--decisions unique to each situation? We have nothing to help us determine what is really right or wrong no matter what situation you, a businessperson, or a salesperson faces. Or do we?

## Three Guidelines for Making Ethical Decisions
* What do you need to make a decision about the right or wrong action to take in any situation? You need a never-changing fixed point of reference that is separate from you so you, or anyone else, can not influence it. The three guidelines to look for in a standard for making ethical decisions, then, are **that it never changes, offers a fixed point of reference, and is separate.** What does that mean
*A **fixed point of reference** refers to something that provides the correct action to take in any situation and never gets tailored to fit an occasion. This fixed point of reference must be separate from you; otherwise you will be changing the rules based upon your best interest in various situations. This is why your conscience is usually not your best guide to making moral and ethical decisions.
* Let's say you are on one of the survivor television shows popular in the early 2000s. You and your teammate are blindfolded, placed in a boad, and set down in the ocean. You are provided a sextand, which is an instrument for measuring angular distances used in navigation to observe altitudes of celestial bodies, such as stars. Your survivor host tells you there is an island directly sound of you at a certain latitude and longitude. And luckily, your teammate knows how to work the sextant.
* How do you know exactly how to reach this island? you have to have a fixed point of reference that never changes and is 100 percent reliable to point you south to the island. Plus, it can not connect with you, your teammate, or the boad. What fits these requirements for making the correct decision? The position of the stars fits these three requirements. Stars are fixed points of reference that never change and are separate from the two of you.
* Using the sextant and teh stars allows you to sail directly to the island. The stars have the same fixed location today that they had 2000 years ago and that they will have in the future. The unchanging star locations offer a good example of a fixed point of reference.
* How does this relate to a person making ethical, moral decisions in real life? As in the examples of the money, class, and bribe, people need a fixed point of reference separate from them that always provide the same correcte ethical answer. What do most people of the world have that fits these three criteria for making the correct decisions in any situation?

## Will the Golden Rule Help?
* Many people of the world make basic right and wrong decisions based upon their religious principles of faith. All the major religious faiths of the world provide their followers with written doctrine. When these doctrines are compared it is interesting to find out that similar faith-based principles appear in all religion despite the differences among the various religions. 
* The key to understanding the Golden Rule from the perspectives of teh religions mentioned is to realize that the aspect of the Golden Rule they hold in common is that it does not involve reciprocity. Reciprocity says if you do for me, I will do for you. Many people think of this as a use of the Golden Rule. It is not!
* As described in Chapter 1, the Golden Rule means doing for others without expecting something in return. When studying Exhibit 2.7 think in terms of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated.
* In her textbook Perspectives in Business Ethics, Laura Hartman asks this question, "Could the Golden Rule serve as a universal, practical, helpful standard for the businessperson's conduct?" What do you think?
* Former President George W. Bush seems to agree with Professor Hartman's inference that the Golden Rule can guide business decisions. In his April 2002 remarks on faith-based initiatives in America, President Bush talked about people heeding a great call. "A call to love your neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. It is a universal call, and it's a call that has been applicable throughout history. It's really needed right now."
* Do you think faith-based perspectives can help people make decisions in an ethical manner? Would you consider your faith a fixed point of reference that never changes and is separate from you? Could your faith's teachings be your moral compass in both your business and your personal life?

## Management's Ethical Responsibilities
* The concept of ethics, like that of social responsibility, is easy to understand. However, ethics is difficult to define in a precise way. In a general sense, ethics are the codes of moral principles and values that govern the behaviors of a person or a group with respect to what is right or wrong. Ethics set standards for what is good or bad in conduct and decision making.
* Many companies and their sales personnel get into trouble by making the mistaken assumption that if it's not illegal, it must be ethical. Ethics and moral values are a powerful force for good that can regulate behaviors both inside and outside the sales force. As principles of ethics and social responsibility are more widely recognized, companies can use codes of ethics and their corporate cultures to govern behavior, thereby eliminating the need for additional laws governing right and wrong.

## What is Ethical Behavior
* Sales personnel are frequently faced with ethical dilemmas. Ethical behaviors refers to treating others fairly. Specifically, it refers to

                * Being honest and truthful
                * Maintaining confidence and trust
                * Following the rules
                * Conducting yourself in the proper manner
                * Treating others fairly
                * Demonstrating loyalty to company and associates
                * Carrying your share of the work and responsibility with 100 percent effort.

* The definition of ethical behavior, while reasonable specific and easy to understand, is difficult to apply in every situation. In real life, there are always conflicting viewpoints, fuzzy circumstances, and unclear positions. Though difficult, it is critically important to cut through the smoke screen that sometimes exists in such a situation and use 20/20 vision to make an ethical choice.

## What Is an Ethical Dilemma
* Because ethical standards are not classified, disagreements and dilemmas about proper behavior often occur. An ethical dilemma arises in a situation when each alternative choice or behavior has some undesirable elements due to potentially negative ethical or personal conseuqnces. Right or wrong can not be clearly identified. Consider the following examples:

                * Your boss says he can not give you a raise this year because of budget constraints, but because of your good work this pas year, he will look the other way if your expense accounts come in a little high
                * Stationed at the corporate headquarters in Chicago, you have 14 salespeople in countries all over the world. A rep living in another country calls to get approval to pay a government official 10,000 to OK an equipment purchase of 5 million. Such payoffs are part of common business practice in that part of the world
                * An industrial engineer, who is your good friend, tells you three of your competitors have submitted price bids on his company's proposed new construction project. He suggests a price you should submit and mentions certain construction specifications his boss is looking for on the job.

* Managers must deal with these kinds of dilemmas and issues that fall squarely in the domain of ethics. Because of their importance, an Ethical Dilemma feature appears in every chapter. In answering the questions at the end of these features, refer both to this chapter and to the chapter in which the feature appears.
* Now let's turn to the three main ethical areas sales personnel face most frequently. These involve

                1. Salespeopl
                2. Employer
                3. Customers.

* Although not all-inclusive, our discussion gives you a feel for some of the difficult situations sales personnel encounter.

## Ethics in Dealing with Salespeople
* Sales managers have both social and ethical responsibilities to sales personnel. Salespeople are a valuable resource; they are recruited, carefully trained, and given important responsibility. They represent a large financial investment and must be treated in a professional manner. Yet, occasionally a company may place managers and/or salespeople in positions that force them to choose among compromising their ethics, not doing what is required, or leaving the organization. The choice depends on the magnitude of the situation. At times, situations arise wherein it is difficult to say whether a sales practice is ethical or unethical. Many sales practices are in a gray area somewhere between completely ethical and completely unethical. Five ethical considerations sales managers face are the level of sales pressure to place on a salesperson, decisions concerning a salesperson's territory, whether to be honest with the salesperson, what to do with the ill salesperson, and employee rights.

## Level of Sales Pressure
* What is an acceptable level of pressure to place on salespeople? Should managers establish performance goals that they know a salesperson has only a 50-50 chance of attaining? Should the manager acknowledge that goals were set too high? If circumstances change in the salesperson's territory--for example, a large customer goes out of business--should the manager lower sales goals? (See Exhibit 2.8)
* These are questions all managers must consider. There are no right or wrong answers. Managers are responsible for group goals. They have a natural tendency to place pressure on salespeople to reach those goals. Some managers motivate their people to produce at high levels without applying pressure whereas others place tremendous pressure on salespeople to attain sales beyond quotas. However, managers should set realistic and obtainable goals. They must consider individual territory situations. If they do so fairly and sales are still down, then pressure may be applied.

## Decisions Affecting Territory
* Management makes decisions that affect sales territories and salespeople. For example, the company might increase the number of sales territories, which often necessitates splitting a single territory. A salesperson may have spent years building the territory to its current sales volume only to have customers taken away. If the sales person has worked on commission, this would mean a decrease in earnings.
* Consider a situation of reducing the number of sales territories. What procedures would you use? See if the real-world examples in this section follow the Golden Rule. Several years ago, a large manufacturer of health and beauty aids (shaving creaming, toothpaste, shampoo) reduced the number of territories to lower selling costs. So, for example, three territories became two. Here is how one of the company's salespeople described it:

                * I made my plane reservation to fly from Dallas to Florida for our annual national meeting. Beforehand, I was told to bring my records up to date and bring them to the regional office in Dallas; don't fly, drive to Dally. I drove from Louisiana to Dallas with my bads packed to go to the national meeting. I walked into the office with my records under my arm. My district and regional managers were there. They told me of the reorganization and said I was fired. They asked for my car keys. I called my wife, told her what happened, and then caught a bus back home. There were five of us in the region that were called in that day. Oh, they gave us a good job recommendation--it's just the way we were treated. Some people had been with the company for five years or more. They didn't eliminate jobs by tenure but by where territories were located.

* Comapnies must deal with their employees in a fair and straightforward manner. If would have been better for managers of these salespeople to go to their hometowns and explain and changes personally. Instead, they treated the salespeople unprofessionally.
* One decision affecting a territory is what to do with extra-large customers, sometimes called key accounts. After they taken away from the salesperson and made into house accounts? Here, responsibility for contacting the accounts rests on someone from the home office (house) or a key account salesperson. The local salesperson may not get credit for sales to this customer even though the customer is in the salesperson's territory. A salesperson states the problem:

                * I've been with the company 35 years. When I first began, I called on some people who had one grocery store. Today, they have 208. The buyer knows me. He buys all of my regular and special greeting cards. They do whatever I ask. I made $22,000 in commissions from their sales last year. Now, management wants to make it a house account.

* Here, the salesperson loses money. It is difficult to treat the salesperson fairly in this situation. The company does not want to pay large commissions, and 90 percent of the 208 stores are located out of the salesperson's territory. Management should carefully explain this to the salesperson. Instead of taking the full 22,000 away from the salesperson, they could pay a one-time bonus as a reward for building up the account.

## To Tell the Truth?
* Should salespeople be told they are not promotable, that they are marginally performer, or that they are being transferred to the poorest territory in the company so that they will quit? Good judgment must prevail. Sales managers prefer to tell the truth.
* Do you tell the truth when you fire a salesperson? If a fired employee has tried and has been honest, many sales managers will tell prospective employers that the person quit voluntarily rather than being fired. One manager put it this way: "I feel he can do a good job for another company. I don't want to hurt his future."

## The Ill Salesperson
* How much help do you give to a salesperson who is addicted to alcohol or drugs, or who is physically or mentally ill? Many companies require salespeople to seek professional help for substance abuse. If they improve, companies offer support and keep them in the field. Yet, there ise only so far the company can go. The firm can not have an intoxicated or high salesperson calling on customers. Once the illness has a negative effect on business, the salesperson is taken out of the territory. Sick leave and workers' compensation often ocver expenses until the salesperson recovers. The manager who shows a sincere, personal interest in helping the ill salesperson greatly contributes to the person's chances of recovery.

## Employee Rights
* The sales manager must be current on ethical and legal considerations regaring employee rights and must develop strategies for the organization in addressing those rights. Here are several important questions that all managers should be able to answer:

                * Under what conditions can an organization fire sales personnel with committing a violation of the law?
                * What rights do and should sales personnel have regarding the privacy of their employment records and access tothem?
                * What can organizations do to prevent sexual and racial harassment and other forms of bias in the workplace?

* **Employee rights** are rights desired by employees regarding their job security and their treatment by employers while on the job, irrespective of whether those rights are currently protected by law or collective bargaining agreements of labor unions. Let's briefly examine three employee-rights questions.

#### Termination-at-Will
* Early in the 20th century, many courts were adamant in strictly applying the common law rule to terminate at will. For example, the **termination-at-will rule** was used in a 1903 case, Boyer v. Western Union Tel. Col, in which the court upheld the company's right to discharge its employees for union activities and indicated that the results would be the same if the company's employees were discharged for being Presbyterians
* Later on, in Lewis v. Minnesota Mutual Life Ins. Co., the termination-at-will rule was used to uphold the dismissal of the life insurance company's best salesperson--even though no apparent cause for dismissal was given and the company had promised the employee lifetime employment in return for his agreement to remain with the company.
* In the early 1980s, court decisions and legislative enactments moved the pendulum of protection away from the employer and toward the rights of the individual employee through limitations on the termination-at-will rule.
* Although many employers claim that their rights have been taken away, they still retain the right to terminate sales personnel for poor performance, excessive absenteeism, unsafe conduct, and poor organizational citizenship. It is crucial, however, for employers to maintain accurate records of these events for employees and to inform employees about where they stand. To be safe, it is also advisable for employers to have an established grievance procedure for employees to ensure that due process is respected. These practices are particularly useful in discharge situations that involve members of groups protected by Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, or the Vietnam Era Veterans Act.

#### Privacy
* Today it is more important than ever to keep objective and orderly personnel files. They are critical evidence that employers have treated their employees fairly and with respect, and have not violated any laws. Without these files, organizations may get caught on the receiving end of a lawsuit.
* Although several federal laws influence record keeping, they are primarily directed at public employers. However, many private employers are giving employees the right to access their personnel files and to prohibit the file information from being given to others without their consent. In addition, employers are casting from their personnel files any non-job related information and ending hiring practices that solicit such information.

#### Harassment
* **Cooperative acceptance** refers to the right of employees to be treated fairly and with respect regardless of race, sex, national origin, physical disability, age, or religion while on the job (as well as in obtaining a job and maintaining job security). Not only does this mean that employees have the right not to be discriminated against in employment practices and decisions, but it also means that employees have the right to be free of sexual and racial harassment.

Facing a Sales Challenge
* Five years ago John Sally graduated with a computer science degree from MIT. One year later, he earned his MBA from Texas A&M University with a perfect "A" average. John was on every campus recruiter's list as an outstanding applicant. He had the brains, personality, looks, and motivation of a winner. IBM convinced him to take a sales job.
* John was at the top of his class in the IBM sales training program. However, his first two years in sales resulted in an average performance. He could not understand why, because his knowledge of the product was outstanding. John could discuss in great depth the most technical aspects of his products. He was not used to being average. John loved sales but felt things had to change.
* If you were in John's position, what would you do?

```

John Sally is like many people who do everything it takes to be successful in sales. Yet for some reason, they never reach their maximum performance potential. To be successful, salespeople need to be knowledgeable, even experts, on everything discussed in Part II, "Preparation for Relationship Selling".
* Chapter 3 examines why and how an individual buys. Numerous influences determine why people buy one product over another. We discuss these reasons and apply them to the various steps in the customer's buying process. This chapter presents selling techniques that will aid you later in developing your sales presentation. They also can help John Salley in his efforts to improve his sales performance. He needs to know why people buy.

The Tree of Business Life: Benefits
* As you learn about the psychology of selling, why people buy, and emphasize benefits in your sales presentation in this chapter, keep the Golden Rule in mind. Customers want to trust you! They depend upon you to tell the truth. Use your selling skills learned in this chapter to help people by being a better communicator. Periodically asking a person about what you have just said is a great way to find out what they think about your talk. Do the right thing for the person, even if it means a "no sale". After all, you are with the person to unselfishly help that person make the correct buying decision for his or her need, not your need to make a sale. Ethical service builds relationships and is based upon the truth.
```

## Why People Buy--The Black Box Approach
* The question of why people buy has interested salespeople for many people. Salespeople know that some customers buy their product after the presentation, yet they wonder what thought process resulted in the decision to buy or not to buy. Prospective buyers are usually exposed to various sales presentations. In some manner, a person internalizes or considers this information and then makes a buying decision. This process of internalization is referred to as a **black box** because we can not see into the buyer's mind--meaning that the salesperson can apply the stimuli (a sales presentation) and observe the behavior of the prospect but can not witness the prospect's actual decision-making process.
* The classic model of buyer behavior shown in Exhibit 3.1 is caclled a **stimulus--response** model. A stimulus (sales presentation) is applied, resulting in a response (purchase decision). This model assumes that prospects respond in some predictable manner to the sales presentation. Unfortunately, it does not tell us why they uby or do not buy the product. This information is concealed in the black box.
* Salespeople seek to understand as much as they can about the mental processes that yield the prospects' responses. We do know:

                * That people buy for both practical (rational) and psychological (emotional) reasons
                * The salespeople can use specific methods to help determine the prospects' thoughts during sales presentations
                * The buyers consider certain factors in making purchase decisions

* This chapter introduces these t hree important topics. Each topic emphasizes the salesperson's need to understand people's behavior.

## Psychological Influences on Buying
* Since personal selling requires understanding human behavior, each salesperson must be concerned with a prospective customer's motivations, perceptions, learning, attitudes, and personality. Furthermore, the salesperson should know how each type of behavior might influence a customer's purchase decision.

## Motivation to Buy Must be There
* Human beings are motivated by needs and wants. These needs and wants build up internally, which causes people to desire to buy a product--a new car or a new duplicating machine. Peoples' **needs** result from a lack of something desirable. **Wants** are needs learned by the person. For example, people need transportation--but some want a BMW while others prefer a Ford Mustang.
* This example illustrates that both practical or rational reasons (the need for transportation) and emotional or psychological reasons (the desire for the prestige of owning a BMW) influence the buying decision. Different individuals have different reasons for wanting to buy. The salesperson must determine a prospect's needs and t hen match the product's benefits to the particular needs and wants of the prospect (see Exhibit 3.2)

## Economic Needs: The Best Value for the Money
* **Economic needs** are the buyer's need to purchase the most satisfying product for the money. Economic needs include price, quality (performance, dependability, durability), convenience of buying, and service. Some people's purchases are based primarily on economic needs. However, most people consider the economic implications of all their purchases along with other reasons for buying.
* Many salespeople mistakenly assume that people base their buying decision solely on price. This is not always correct. A higher product price relative to competing goods often can be offset by such factors as service, quality, better performance, friendliness of the salesperson, and convenience of purchase.
* Whatever a person's need might be, it is important for a salesperson to uncover it. Once you determine the individual's need, you are better prepared to develop your sales presentation in a manner relating your product's benefits to that particular need.

## Awareness of Needs: Some Buyers Are Unsure
* You have seen that people purchase products to satisfy various needs. Often, however, these needs are developed over such a long period that people may not be fully conscious of their reasons for buying or not buying a product. Three levels of need awareness have been identified--conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.
* At the first level, the **conscious need level**, buyers are fully aware of their needs. These are the easiest people to sell to because they know what products they want and are willing to talk about their needs. A customer might say to the salesperson, "I'd like to buy a new car and I want a BMW loaded with accessories. What can you show me?"
* At the second level, the **preconscious need level**, buyers may not be fully aware of their needs. Needs may not be fully developed in the conscious mind. They know what general type of product they want but may not wish to discuss it fully. For example, a buyer may want to buy a certain product because of a strong ego need yet be hesitant about telling you. If you don't make a sale and ask why, this buyer may present false reasons, such as saying your price is too high, rather than revealing the real motivation. Falsification is much easier than stating the t rue reasons for not buying your product--thus getting into a long conversation with you, arguing with you, or telling you that your product is unsatisfactory. **You must avoid this brush-off by determining a buyer's real needs first and then relating your product's benefits to these needs.**
* At the third level, the **unconscious need level**, people do not know why they buy a product--only that they do buy. When people say, "I really don't know what I want to buy." It may be true. **Their buying motives might have developed years earlier and may have been repressed. In this case, the salesperson needs to determine the needs that are influential. Often, this is accomplished by skillful questioning to draw out prospective buyers' unconscious needs.** An awareness of the types of needs that buyers may have will allow you to present your product as a vehicle for satisfaction of those needs. Several methods of presenting a product's benefits are available.

## A Fabulous Approach to Buyer Need Satisfaction
* A most powerful selling technique used by successful salespeople today is benefit selling. In benefit selling, the salesperson relates a product's benefits to the customer's needs using the product's features and advantages as support. This technique is often referred to as the FAB selling technique (Feature, Advantage, and Benefit). These key terms are defined as follows:

                * A product **feature** is any phyiscal characteristic of a product
                * A product **advantage** is the performance characteristic of a product that describes how it can be used or will help the buyer
                * A product **benefit** is a favorable result the buyer receives from the product because of a particular advantage that has the ability to satisfy a buyer's need.

## The Product's Features: SO What?
* All product have features or physical characteristics such as the following: **size, terms, packaging, color, quantity, flavor, taste, price, service, quality, shape, uses delivery, ingredients, technology**
* Descriptions of a product's features answer the question, What is it? Typically, when used alone in the sales presentation, features have little persuasive power because buyers are interested in specific benefits rather than features.
* When discussing a product's features alone, imagine the customer is thinking, "So what? So your product has this shape or quality; how does it perform and how will it benefit me?" That is why you have to discuss the product's advantages as they relate to the buyer's needs.

## The Product's Advantages: Prove It!
* Once a product feature is presented to the customer, the sealeperson normally begins to discuss the advantages that product's physical characteristics provide. This is better than discussing only its features. Describing the product's advantages, how a product can be used, or how it will help the buyer increase the chances of making a sale. Examples of product advantages (performance characteristics) follow:

                * It is the fastest-selling soap on the market
                * You can store more information and retrieve it more rapidly with our computer
                * This machine will copy on both sides of the pages instead of only one

* How does the prospective customer know that your claims for a product are true? Imagine a prospect thinking. "Prove it!" By prepared to substantiate any claims you make.
* Companies typically train their salespeople thoroughly on the product's phyiscal and performance characteristics. A salesperson may have excellent knowledge of the product yet be unable to describe it in terms that allow the prospect to visualize the benefit of purchasing it. This is because many salespeople present only a product's features and advantages--leaving the buyer to imagine the benefits.
* While your chances of helping the customer increase when you discuss both the features and the advantages of your product, you must learn how to stress product benefits that are important to the prospect in your presentation. Once you have mastered this selling technique, your sales will increase.

## The Product's Benefits: What's in It for Me?
* People are interested in what the product will do for them. Emphasizing benefits appeals to the customer's personal motives by answering the question. What's in it for me? In your presentation, stress how the person will benefit from the purchase rather than the features and advantages of your product as shown in Exhibit 3.3
* To illustrate the idea of buying benefits instead of only features or advantages, consider four items: 1. a diamond ring, 2. a camera, 3. STP motor oil, and 4. movie tickets. Do people buy these products or services for their features or advantages? No; people buy the product's benefits such as these:

                * A diamond ring-- image of success, investment, or to please a loved one
                * A camera--memories of places, friends, and family
                * STP motor oil--engine protection, car investment, or peace of mind
                * Movie tickets--entertainment, escape from reality, or relaxation

* As you can see, people are buying benefits--not a product's features or advantages. These benefits can be both practical, such as an investment, and psychological, such as an image of success. The salesperson needs to discuss benefits to answer the prospect's question, What's in it for me?

```
Example
* Vacuum-cleaner salesperson to householder: "This vacuum cleaner's high-speed motor (feature) works twice as fast (advantage) with less effort (advantage), which saves you 15 to 30 minutes in cleaning time (benefit) and the aches and pains of pushing a heavy machine (benefit)"
* Sporting goods salesperson to customer: "With this ball, you'll get an extra 10 to 20 yards on your drives (advantage), helping to reduce your score (benefit) because of its new solid core (feature)
* Salesperson to buyer of grocery store heal and beauty aids: "Prell's economy size (feature) sells the best of all brands (advantage) in stores like yours. You can increase store traffic 10 to 20 percent (benefit) and build your sales volume by at least 5 percent (benefit) by advertising and reducing its normal price (feature) in next Wednesday's ad"

```
* New salespeople frequently are not accustomed to using feature, advantage, and benefit phrases. To use them regularly in your sales conversation, a standardized FAB Sequence can be used as following

**The ...(feature)...means you (advantage)... with the real benefit to you being ...(benefit)...**

* The FAB Sequence allows you to easily remember to state the product's benefit in a natural, conversational manner. For example, "The new solid core center of the Gunshot Gold Ball means you will have an extra 10 or 20 yards on your drives with the real benefit to you being a lower score." You can substitute any features, advantages, and benefits between these transition phrases to develop FAB sequences. Several sequences can be used one after another to emphasize your product's benefits.
* Try it. Out loud, read the golf ball FAB Sequence. Then do it again using your own phrasing. Create several variations until finding one you would feel comfortable using in a conversation.
* Why should you emphasize benefits? There are two reasons (see Exhibit 3.4). First, by emphasizing benefits customers can better understand if your product will satisfy their need(s). Your primary purpose is to help the person. Second, stressing benefits in your presentation, rather than features or advantages, will bring success. You will satisfy more people's needs and thus your sales will increase.
* Given that people make a buying decision based on whether they believe a product's benefits will satisfy their needs, how can you uncover a buyer's needs?

## How to Determine Important Buying Needs--A Key to Success
* Your initial task when first meeting the customer to differentiate between important buying needs and needs of lesser of no importance. Exhibit 3.4 illustrates the concept that buyers have both important needs and needs that are not major reasons for buying a product (relatively unimportant buying needs)
* Determine buyers' important needs and concentrate on emphasizing product benefits that will satisfy those needs. Benefits that would satisfy buyers' unimportant needs should be deemphasized in the sales presentation. Suppose your product had benefits involving service, delivery, time savings, and cost reductions. Is the buyer interested in all four benefits? Maybe not. If you determine that delivery is not important, concentrate on discussing service, time savings, and cost reductions. This selling strategy is important to your success in helping the buyer.
* Elmer Wheeler, a famouse sales speaker, said, "Sell the sizzle, not the steak!" Wheeler is saying that people buy for reasons other than what the product will actually do or its price. They have both practical (rational) and psychological (emotional) reasons for buying. Customers may not buy the product to solve the rational need that the salesperson perceives as important. They may buy to satisfy an emotional need not easily recognized. It is important to understand this sales concept and learn to determine the buyer's important buying needs. A list of common psychological buying needs include these

                * Fear
                * Vanity (keep up with the Joneses)
                * Security
                * Love of family
                * Personal pleasure
                * Desire to succeed
                * Comfort or luxury
                * Self-preservation
                * Prevention of loss

* You must determine the buying needs that are most important to the customer. How can you do this? Several methods are frequently used to uncover important needs. These methods create the acronym **L-O-C-A-T-E**:

                * Listen: Prospect may drop leading remarks like "I wish I had a television like this one"
                * Observe: Look at prospects; study their surroundings. Experienced salespeople can determine much about people by observaing the way they dress or where they live and work
                * Combine: A skillful salesperson may talk to others, listen to a prospect, probe with questions, make careful observations, and emphathize--all in an effort to uncover the prospect's needs
                * Ask questions: Questions often bring out needs that the prospect would not reveal or does not know. The salesperson asks, "Is a quiet celling fan important to you?" "Yes, it is," says the buyer. "If I could provide you with the quiested ceiling fan on the market, would you be interested?"
                * Talk to others: Ask others about a prospect's needs. For instance, ask an office manager's secretary about the manager's satisfaction with a copy machine
                * Emphasize: look at the situation from the customer's point of view.

* Once you determine the major buying need, you are ready to relate the person's needs to your product's benefits. Like the television camera that transmits images to the television receiver, buyers picture desired products in their minds. Before they focus the picture, buyers often need to be turned on and tuned in. Once you find their real reasons for wanting a particular product or identify major problems that they want to solve, you have uncovered the key to helping them.
* Uncovering these important buying needs is pushing the button that turns on a machine. You have just pushed the customer's hot button. You have awakened a need, and customers realize that you understand their problems. **Basically, this is what selling is all about--determining needs and skillfully relating your product's benefits to show how its purchase will fulfill customers' needs.**
* This is not always easy. As we have seen, people have a multitude of different needs and may not understand or see their unconscious needs or problems. **In this situation, your challenge is to convert customers' apparently unconscious needs into recognized and understood needs. One of the best ways to uncover needs is to ask questions at certain times during the sales presentation. The questions is referred toas a trial close.**

## The Trial Close--A Great Way to Uncover Needs and Sell
* The **trial close** is one of the best selling techniques to use in your sales presentation. It checks the pulse or attitude of your prospect toward the sales presentation. The trial close should be used at these four important times:

                1. After making a strong selling point in the presentation
                2. After the presentation
                3. After answering an objection
                4. Immediately before you move to close the sale

* The trial close allows you to determine 1. whether the prospect likes your product's feature, advantage, or benefit; 2. whether you have successfully answered the objection; 3. whether an objections remain; and 4. whether the prospect is ready for you to close the sale. It is a powerful technique to induce two-way communication (feedback) and participation from the prospect. The Selling Tip box gives example of trial closes. Learn these--you'll use them throughout the course.
* If, for example, the prospect says little while you make your presentation, and if you get a "no" when you come to the close, you may find it difficult to change the prospect's mind. You have not learned the real reasons why the prospect says no. To avoid this, salespeople use the trial close to determine the prospect's attitude toward the product throughout the presentation.
* The trial close asks for the prospect's opinion, not a decision to buy. It is a direct question that can be answered with few words. Look at the trial close examples shown in Selling Tips.
* Remember the prospect's position reactions. use them later to help overcome objections and in closing the sale. Also remember the negative comments. You may need to offset the negatives with the positives later in the presentation. Generally, however, you will not discuss the negative again.
* Here is an example of using the prospect's positive comments to ask for the order. Assume that during the presentation you have learned from the prospect that she likes the product's profit margin, fast delivery, and credit policy. You can summarize these benefits in a positive manner such as this:

                * Salesperson: Ms. Stevenson, you say you like our profit margin, fast delivery, and credit policy. Is that right [Summary and trial close.]
                * Prospect: Yes, I do.
                * Salesperson: With the number of customers coming into your store and our expected sales of the products due to normal turnover, along with our marketing, I suggest you buy ... [State the products and their quantities]. This will provide sufficient quantities to meet customer demand for the next two months, plus provide you with the profit you expect from your products. i can have the order to you early next week. [Now wait for her response]

* Note that the prospect has said there are three things she likes about what you are selling. If the prospect responds favorably to your trial close, then you are to agreement or you have satisfactorily answered an objection. Thus, the prospect may be ready to buy. However, if you receive a negative response, do not close. Either you have not answer some objection or the prospect is not interestd in the feature, advantage, or benefit you are discussing. This feedback allows you to better uncover what your prospect thinks about your product's potential for satisfying needs.

```
Selling Tips

Using Trial Closes
* The trial close is an important part of the sales presentation. It asks for the prospect's opinion concerning what you have just said. The trial close does not ask the person to buy directly. Here are examples:

                * How does that sound to you?
                * What do you think?
                * Are these the features you are looking for?
                * That's great--isn't it
                * Is this important to you?
                * Does that answer your concern?
                * I have a hunch that you like the money-saving features of the product? Did I guess right?
                * It appears that you have a preference for this model. Is that what you had in mind.
                * I can see that you are excited about this product. On a scale from 1 to 10, how do you feel it will fit your needs?
                * I notice your smile. What do you think about...?
                * Am I on the right tract with this proposal?

```

## Sell Sequence
* One way to remember to incorporate a trial close into your presentation is the SELL Sequence. Exhibit 3.5 shows how each letter of the word sell stands for a sequence of things to do and say to stress benefits important to the customer. By remembering the word sell, you remember to show the feature, explain the advantage, lead into the benefit, and then let the customer talk about asking a question about the benefit (trial close)

EXAMPLE
* Industrial salesperson to industrial purchasing agent: "This equipment is made of stainless steel (feature), which means it won't rust (advantage). The real benefit is that it reduces your replacement costs, thus saving you money (benefit)! That's what you're interested in--right? (trial close)

EXAMPLE
* Beecham salesperson to consumer goods buyer: "Beecham will spend an extra 1 million in the next two months advertising Cling Free fabric software (feature). Plus, you can take advantage of this month's 1.20 per dozen price reduction (feature). This means you will sell 15 to 20 percent more Cling Free in the next two months (advantage), thus making higher profits and pulling more customers into your store (benefit). How does that sound (trial close)?

* Once you use a trial close, carefully listen to what the customer says and watch for nonverbal signals to determine if what you said has an impact. If you receive a positive response to your trial close, you are on the right track.
* Remember, the trial close does not ask the customer to buy or make any type of purchase decision. It asks only for an opinion. **The trial close is a trial question to determin the customer's opinion toward the salesperson's proposition to know if it is time to close the sale. Thus, its main purpose is to induce feedback from the buyer.**

# Chapter 4: Communication for Relationship Building: It's Not All Talk

## Facing a Sales Challenge
* Amos Skaggs, purchasing agent, stands as a salesperson enters his office. "Hi, Mr Skaggs," the salesperson says, offering his hand. Skaggs returns a limp, one-second handshake and sits down behind his desk. He begins to open his afternoon mail, almost as though no one else was in the room.
* The salesperson sits down and begins his canned sales talk by saying, "Mr Skaggs, I'm here to show you how your company can lower manufacturing costs by 10 percent" Skaggs lays his mail down on his desk, leans back in his chair, crosses his arms, and with a growl says: "I'm glad to hear that. You know something, young fellow, pretty soon it won't cost us anything to manufacture our product." "Why is that?" the salesman mumbles, meekly looking down to the floor. "Well, you are the ninth person I've seen today who has offered to save us 10 percent on our costs."
* Skaggs stands up, leans over the table, and while peering over his glasses says slowly. "I believe I've heard enough sales pitches for one day." The initially enthusiastic salesperson now apologetically says, "If this is not a good time for you, sir, I can come back at a later date."
* The problem facing the salesperson is common. The buyer has been seeing salespeople all day. Basically, they say the same thing. "Buy from me and I'll save you money" The buyer has communicated his feelings toward the salesperson both verbally and nonverbally. What message has Skaggs sent to the salesperson? If you were the salesperson, what might you do now?

* Although many other factors are crucial to sales success, the ability to communicate effectively is of prime importance. To convincingly convey this important sales skill, this chapter directly applies a basic communication model to the buyer-seller interaction. We describe several factors influencing communication along with possible barriers to effective communication. We also examine the often ignored--though always critical--topic of nonverbal communication. The balance of this chapter relates some techniques to improve sales communication.

## The Tree of Business Communication
* What if you could read someone's mind? What if you could tell what he or she is thinking? Wow, wouldn't that be cool! How would you use the knowledge of what is going on in a person's mind about what you are saying--for helping or selling purposes? For the other person's best interst or your best interest? People have ears, but can not hear. People have eyes, but can not see. People have two ears and one mouth but do more talking than listening. What are your answers for these four questions? How do the three "People have..." sayings relate to your life.
* This chapter, and the last chapter, provides several of the little known secrets about how to read people's minds. Body language, coupled with asking questions periodically as you talk with someone and listening to his or her replies, is a great way to better understand what is going on in someone's mind. Questions, watching nonverbals, listening, talking as needed are secrets to successfully helping others in a sales situation. It also works in your everyday life. Try them! use these secrets of effective communication for building long-term relationships based on the Golden Rule of Selling. Ethical service builds relationships and is based on the truth.

## Communication: It Takes Two
* **Communication**, in a sales context, is the act of transmitting verbal and nonverbal information and understanding between seller and buyer. This definition presents communication as an exchange process of sending and receiving messages with some type of response expected between seller and buyer.
* This sound simple, right? But have you ever had someone talk to you and realize you did not hear what was said? "You have eyes but do not see; you have ears but do not hear" is a saying that dates back thousands of years. The wise saying is important to all of us, including salespeople, in our daily living. Salespeople have to understand the many ways people communicate with them.
* Communication channels during the sales presentation take many forms. Ideas and attitude can be effective communicated by media other than language. Actually, in a normal two-person conversation, less than 35 percent of the social meaning utilizes verbal components. Said another way, much of the social meaning in a conversation is converyed nonverbally. Furthermore, what you say verbally is not always what you actually mean. Exhibit 4.1 expands on this point by illustrating the psychological though processes of both the speaker and the listener.
* Research has found that face-to-face communication is composed of verbal, vocal, and facial communication messages. One equation presents the total impact of commmunicated messages as equal to 7 percent verbal, 38 percent tone of voice, and 55 percent nonverbal expressions. If one recognizes these findings as a reasonable approximation of the total communicative process, then uninformed salespeople actually ignore a major part of the communication process that occurs during buyer-seller interaction. How the sales message is given can be as important as making the sale as what is said. Thus, nonverbal communication are important in communication between buyer and seller. An awareness of nonverbal communication is a valuable tool in successfully making a sale.
* Vocal communication includes such factors as voice quality, pitch, inflection, and pauses. A salesperson's use of vocal factors can aid in sales presentation, too. Along with verbal, vocal, and nonverbal communication, many other elements also are involved in sales communication.

## Salesperson-Buyer Communication Process Requires Feedback
* A basic communication model that depicts how the salesperson-buyer communication process is shown in Exhibit 4.2. Basically, communication occurs when a sender transmit a message through some type of medium to a receive who responds to that message. Exhibit 4.2 presents a model that contains eight major communication elements. These elements are defined as follows:

        * Source. The source of communication (also called the communicator); in our case, it's the salesperson
        * Encoding process. The salesperson's conversion of ideas and concepts into the language and materials used in the sales presentation
        * Message. The information intended to be conveyed in the sales presentation
        * Medium. The form of communication used in the sales presentation and discussion; most frequently words, visual materials, and body language
        * Decoding process. Receipt and translation (interpretation) of the information by the receiver (prospective buyer)
        * Receiver. The person the communication is intended for; in our case, it's the prospect or buyer
        * Feedback. Reaction to the communication as transmitted to the sender. This reaction may be verbal, nonverbal, or both.
        * Noise. Factors that distort communication between buyer and seller. Noise includes barriers to communication, which we will discuss later.

* This model portrays the communication process. A salesperson should know how to develop a sales presentation (encoding) so that the buyer obtains maximum understanding of the message (decoding). The salesperson should use communication media that most effectively communicate a specific sales message. Clear verbal discussion, visual aids such as pictures or diagrams, and models or samples of the product are several types of media a salesperson might use in communicating a sales message.
* Studies have shown that people retain 10 percent of what they read, 20 percent of what they see, 30 percent of what they hear, and 50 percent of what they hear and see. If possible, it is important to incorporate into your presentation communication that appeals to all five senses (sight, hearing, smell, feel, taste). This is challenging to do!
* One-way communication occurs when the salesperson talks and the buyer only listens. The salesperson needs a response or feedback from the buyer to know if communication occurs. Does the buyer understand the message? Once feedback or interaction and understanding between buyer and seller exist in a commmunication process, two-way communication has been established.
* Two-way communication is essentialy to make the sale. The buyer must understand your message's information to make a buying decision. Two-way communication gives the salesperson the ability to present a product's benefit, instantly receive buyer reactions, and answer questions. Buyer usually react both verbally and nonverbally to your presentation

```
Say What You Mean
* At least six message are involved in the communication process.

        1. What you mean to say
        2. What you really say
        3. What the other person hears
        4. What the other person thinks is heard
        5. What the other person says about what you said
        6. What you think the other person said about what you said

* It gets complicated, doesn't Sue and I were looking at a gorgeous moon together under romantic circumstances. As we shared the moment, how was i actually feeling? I was feeling romantic. If we followed the six messages, the incident would have looked something like this:

        1. What you mean to say ("the moon puts me in a romantic mood")
        2. What you really say ("Isn't that a brilliant moon?")
        3. What the other person hears ("The moon is bright")
        4. What the other person thinks she hears. ("Yes, it's bright enough for a walk")
        5. What the other person says about what you said. ("Yes, it's bright eough to hit a gold ball by")
        6. What you think the other person said about what you said. ("I don't feel romantic")

* We can miss each other's wavelengths completely by the time the six message are completed with even realizing what has happened. All of us are constantly in the process of encoding and decoding messages.
* We need to learn to ask questions or restate the point to clarify meaning. To say what we mean straightforwardly must be our constant goal in order for those around us to discard all decoding devices.

## Nonverbal Communication: Watch for It
* Recognition and analysis of nonverbal communication in sales transactions is relatively new. Only in the past 10 to 15 years has the subject been formally examined in detail. The presence and use of nonverbal communication, however, has been acknowledged for years. In the early 1900s, Sigmund Freud noted that people can not keep a secret even if they do not speak. A person's gestures and actions reveal hidden feelings about something.
* People communicate nonverbally in several ways. Four major **nonverbal** communication channels are the physical space between buyer and seller, appearance, handshake, and body movements.

## Concept of Space
* The concept of **territorial space** refers to the area around the self that a person will not allow another person to enter without consent. Early experiments in territorial space dealt with animals. These experiments determined that higher-status members of a group often are affored a freedom of movement that is less available to those of lower status. This idea has been applied to socially acceptable distance of space that human being keep between themselves in certain situations. Territorial space can easily be related to the selling situation.
* Space considerations are important to salespeople because violations of territorial space without customer consent may set off the customer's deense mechanisms and create a barrier to communications. A person (buyer) has four main types of distance to consider--intimate (up to 2 feet); personal (2 to 4 feet); social (4 to 12 feet); and public (greater than 12 feet)
* **Intimate space** of up to 2 feet, or about arm's length, is the most sensitive zone, since it is reserved for close friends and loved ones. To enter intimate spacein the buyer-seller relationship, for some prospects, could be socially unacceptable--possibly offensive.
* During the presentation, a salesperson should carefully listen and look for signs that indicate the buyer feels uncomfortable--perhaps that the salesperson is too close. A buyer may deduce from such closeness that the salesperson is attempting to dominate or overpower the buyer. This feeling can result in resistance to the salesperson. If such uneasiness is detected, the salesperson should move back, which reassures the customer.
* **Personal space** is the closest zone a stranger or business acquaintance is normally allowed to enter. Even in this zone, a prospect may be uncomfortable. Barriers, such as a desk, often reduce the threat implied when someone enters this zone.
* **Social space** is the area normally used for a sales presentation. Again, the buyer often uses a desk to maintain a distance of 4 feet or more between buyer and seller. Standing while facing a seated prospect may communicate to the buyer that the salesperson seems too dominating. Thus, the salesperson should normally stay seated to convey a relaxed manner.
* A salesperson should consider beginning a presentation in the middle of the social distance zone, 6 to 8 feet, to avoid the prospect's erecting negative mental barriers. This is especially true if the salesperson is not a friend of the prospect.
* **Public space** can be used by the salesperson making a presentation to a group of people. It is similar to the distance between teacher and student in a classroom. People are at east, and thus easy to communicate with, at this distance because they do not feel threatened by the salesperson.

### Space Threats
* The territorial imperative causes people to feel that they should defned their space or territory against **space threats**. The salesperson who pulls upa chair too close, takes over all or part of the prospect's desk, leans on or over the desk, or touches the objects on the desk runs the risk of invading a prospect's territory. Be careful not to create defensive barriers. However, should you sense a friendliness between yourself and the prospect, use territorial space to your benefit.

### Space Invasion
* The prospect who allows you to enter or invade personal and intimate space is saying, "Come on into my space; let's be friends." Now you can use space to your advantage.
* In most offices, the salesperson sits directly across the desk from the prospect. The prospect controls the space arrangement. This defensive barrier allows the prospect to control much of the conversation and remain safe from **space invation.** often, seating in prearranged and it could be a space threat if you moved your chair when calling on a prospect for the first time.
* However, if you have a choice between a chair across the desk or beside the desk, take the latter seat, as shown in Exhibit 4.3. Sitting beside the prospect lowers the desk communication barrier. If you are friends with the buyer, move your chair to the side of the desk. This helps create a friendly, cooperative environment between you and the buyer.

## Communication through Appearance and the Handshake
* Often common methods of nonverbal communication are signals conveyed by a person's physical appearance and handshake. Once territorial space has been established, general appearance is the next medium of nonverbal communication a salesperson conveys to a customer. Appearance not only conveys information such as age, sex, height, weight, and physicaly characteristics, but it also provides much data on personality. For instance, hairstyle is one of the first things a buyer notices about a salesperson.

### Style Hair Carefully
* Hairstyle traditionally has been important in evaluating personal appearance. Today's salespeople must consider the type of customer they call and adjust their hairstyles accordingly. Both male and female salespeople should visit a hairstylist. Though recently decreasing somewhat in popularity, some male salepeople wear facial hair. Salespeople should carefully consider their grooming and its impact on customers' perceptions. Some companies ask males salespersons to be clean shaven and wear conservative haircuts. Their female salespersons are asked to choose a simple, business like, shoulder-length hairstyle. Other companies leave grooming up to each individual. Your grooming objective is to eliminate communication barriers. Your grooming can convey a favorable first impression. Should your company not have a policy on grooming, examining your customers' grooming before deciding on your style.

### Dress as a Professional
* Wardrobe has always been a major determinant of sales success, and today it is emphasized as never before. A variety of books and articles have appeared on proper dress for businesspeople. These books espouse the doctrine that men and women sales representatives should wear conservative, serious clothing that projects professionalism, just the right amound of authority, and a desire to please the customer. Sporty clothing is believe to accentuate sales aggressiveness, which can place a purchasing agent on the defensive and result in lost sales.
* Many companies believe that decision rules exist for every major clothing item and accessory, but these are derivatives of one basic commandment--dress in a simple, elegant style. Xerox, IBM, and other large companies have incorporated these ideas into their sales training and daily policies. These firms encourage sales personnel to wear dark, conservative clothing. This practice is designed to project conservative, stable corporate image to both customers and the general public.
* Exhibit 4.4 and the "Dress for Success" appendix at the end of this chapter illustrate several key considerations for appropriate dress and grooming. Before reading on, look over the appendix at the end of this chapter to better prepare you for the business world.
* If you are uncertain about what to do, visit several retailers. Make sure at least one retailer is a specialty store. They will have the latest styles and spend time with you. Tell the salespeople what you are looking for and see what they say. Think of this as an investment in yourself because it is expensive to build a wardrobe. However, you are worth it!
* Clothes, accessories, and shoes are important, but do not forget personal grooming, such as skin care and hairstyle, as noted above. Learn to recognize image symbols in business dress and use them to your advantage. Be cautious about becoming too individualistic--the unspoken message in most companies is that freedom in dress may be a privilege of rank. Remember, too, that these guides for dress, including the remainder of the chapter, also apply to selling yourself in job interviews.
* The nonverbal messages that salespeople emit through appearance should be positive in all sales situations. Characteristics of the buyer, cultural aspects of a sales territory, and the type of product being sold all determine a mode of dress. In considering these aspects, create a business wardrobe that sends positive, nonverbal messages in every sales situation.

### Shake Hands Firmly and Look People in the Eye
* Once you have determine appropriate dress and hairstyle, the next nonverbal communication channel to consider is your contact with a prospect through the handshake. The handshake is said to have evolved from a gesture of peace between warriors. By joining hands, two warriors were unable to bear arms against one another (assuming that a shield--not a weapon--was held in the other hand)
* Today, a handshake is the most common way for two people to touch one another in a business situation, and some people feel that it is a revealing gesture. A firm handshake is more intense and is indicative of greater liking and warmer feelings. A prolong handshake is more intimate than a brief one, and it could cause the customer discomfort, especially in a sales call on a new prospect. A loosely clasped, col, or limp handshake is usually interpreted as indicating that someone is aloof and unwilling to become involved. This cold fish handshake is also perceived as unaffectionate and unfriendly.
* General rules for a successful handshake include extending your hand first--if appropriate. Remember, however, a few people may be uncomfortable shaking hands with a stranger. At times, you may want to allow your customer to initiate the gesture. Maintain eye contact with the customer during the handshake, gripping the hand firmly. These actions allow you to initally establish an atmosphere of honesty and mutual respect--starting the presentation in a positive manner.

Exhibit 4.5: Five tips for international handshaking
1. International protocol dictates that you shake hands with everyone in a room--omissions are noticed, and are considered a rejection.
2. Women should initiate handshakdes, and shake hands with other women and men. Not extending her hand to a European male will cause an American businesswoman to lose credibility
3. Western and Eastern European reshake hands whenever they 're apart for even a shorter period of time
4. French and Japanese businesspeople shake hands with one firm gesture. In Japan, the handshake may be combined with a slight bow, which should be returned.
5. In Arab countries, handshakes are a bit limp and last longer than typical American handshakes. Latin Americans also tend to use a lighter, longering handshake. In all cases, don't pull your hand away too soon, such a gesture will be interpreted as a rejection.
```

### Body Language Gives You Clues
* From birth, people learn to communicate their needs, likes, and dislikes through nonverbal means. The salesperson can learn much from a prospect's raised eyebrow, a smile, a touch, a scowl, or reluctance to make eye contact during a sales presentation. The prospect can communicate with you literally without uttering a word. An ability to interpret these signals is an invaluable tool to the successful sales professional. In conjunction with interpretation of body language, the salesperson's skillful use and control of physical actions, gestures, and overall body position also are helpful.
* The buyer can send nonverbal signals via five communication modes. They are the body angle, facial expression and movement or position, hand movements or position, and leg position. (Exhibit 4.6 shows examples). These modes generally send three types of messages: 1. acceptance, 2. caution, 3. disagreement

* **Acceptance signals** indicate that your buyer is favorably inclined toward you and your presentation. These signals give you the green light to proceed. While this may not end in a sale, at the least the prospect is saying, "I am willing to listen" What you are saying is both acceptable and interesting. Some common acceptance signals include these:

        * Body angle: Leaning forward or upright at attention
        * Face. Smailing, pleasant expression, relaxed, eyes examining visual aids, direct eye contact, positive voice tones
        * Hands. Relaxed and generally open, perhaps performing business calculations on paper, holding on as you attempt to withdraw a product sample or sales materials, firm handshake
        * Arms. Relaxed and generally open
        * Legs. Crossed and pointed toward you or uncrossed.

* Salespeople frequently rely only on facial expression as indicators of acceptance. This practice may be misleading since buyers may consciously control their facial expressions. Scan each of the five key body areas to verify your interpretation of facial signals. A buyer who increases eye contact, maintain a relaxed position, and exhibits positive facial expressions gives excellent acceptance signals.
* Acceptance signals indicate the buyers perceive that your product might meet their needs. You have obtain their attention and interest. You are free to continue with your planned sales presentation.
* **Caution signals** should alert you that buyers are either neutral or skeptical toward what you say. Caution signals are indicated by these characteristics:

        * Body angle. Leaning away from you
        * Face. Puzzled, little or no expression, averted eyes or little eye contact, neutral or questioning voice tone, saying little, and then asking only a few questions.
        * Arms. Crossed, tense
        * Hands. Moving, fidgeting with something, clasped, weak handshake
        * Legs. Moving, crossed away from you

* Caution signals are important for you to recognize and adjust to for two main reasons. First, they indicate blocked communication. Buyers' perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs regarding your presentation may cause them to be skeptical, judgmental, or uninterestedin your product. Even though you may have their attention, they show little interest in or desire for your product.
* Second, if caution signals are not handled properly, they may evolved into disagreement signals, which causes a communication breakdown and makes a sale difficult. Proper handling of caution signals requires that you

        * Adjust to the situation by slowing down or departing from your planned presentation
        * Use open-ended questions to encourage your buyers to talk and express their attitudes and beliefs. How might we improve the efficiency of your workforce? and What do you think about this benefit? are examples of open-ended querstions.
        * Carefully listen to what buyers say, and respond directly
        * Project acceptance signals. Be positive, enthusiatic, and smile. Remember, you are glad to be there to help buyers satisfy their needs. Refrain from projecting caution signals even if a buyer does so. if you project a positive image in this situation, there is greater probability that you will change a caut ion light to a green one and make the sale.

* Your objective in using these techiques is to chagne the yellow caution signal to the green go-ahead signal. If you continue to receive caution signals, proceed carefully with your presentation. Be realistic and alert to the possibility that the buyer may begin to believe that your product is not beneficial and begin sending disagreement or red-light signals
* **Disagreement signals** tell you immediately to stop the planned presentation and quickly adjust to the situation. Disagreements, or red-light signals, indicate that you are dealing with a person becoming uninterested in your product. Anger or hostility may develop if you continue the presentation. Your continuation can cause a buyer to feel an unacceptable level of sales pressure, resulting in a complete communication breakdown. Disagreement signals may be indicated by these signs:

        * Body angle. Retracted shoulders, leaning away from you, moving the entire body back from you, or wanting to move away
        * Face. Tense, showing anger, wrinkled face and brow, little eye contact, negative voice tones, or sudden silence.
        * Arms. Tense, crossed over chest.
        * Hands. Motions of rejection or disapproval, tense and clenched, weak handshake.
        * Legs. Crossed and away from you

* You should handle disagreement signals as you did caution signals, by using open-ended questions and projecting acceptance signals. There are four additional techniques to use. First, stop your planned presentation. There is no use in continuing until you have changed disagreement signals into caution or acceptance signals. Second, temporarily reduce or eliminate any pressure on the person to buy or to participate in the conversation. Let the buyer relax as you slowly move back to your presentation. Third, let your buyer know you are aware that something upsetting has occured. Show that you are there to help, not to sell at any cost. **Finally, use direct questions to determine a buyer's attitudes and beliefs such as "What do you think of...?" or "Have I said something you do not agree with?"**

#### Body Guidelines
* Over time, you will know customers well enough to understand the meaning of their body movements. Although a prospect may say no to making a purchase, body movement may indicate uncertainty.
* Exhibit 4.7 relates some common nonverbal signals that buyers may project. The interpretation of most body language is obvious. Be cautious in interpreting an isolated gesture, such as assuming that little eye contact means the prospect is displeased with what you are saying. Instead, concentrate on nonverbal cues that are part of a cluster or pattern. Let's say your prospect begins staring at the wall. That is a clue that may mean nothing. You continue to talk. Now, the prospect leans back in the chair. That is another clue. By itself, it may be meaningless, but in conjunction with the first clue, it begins to take on meaning. Now, you see the prospect turn away, legs crossed, brow wrinkled. You now have a cluster of clues forming a pattern. it is time to adjust or change your presentation.
* In summary, remember that nonverbal communication is well worth considering in selling. A salesperson ought to

        * Be able to recognize nonverbal signals
        * Be able to interpret them correctly
        * Be prepared to alter a selling strategy by slowing, changing, or stopping a planned presentation
        * Respond nonverbally and verbally to a buyer's nonverbal signals.

* Effective communication is essential in making a sale. Nonverbal communication signals are an important part of the total communication process between buyer and seller. Professional salespeople seek to learn and understand nonverbal communication to increase their sales success.


### Barriers to Communication
* Like the high hurdler, a salesperson often must overcome a multit ude of obstacles. These obstacles are more aptly called barriers to communication. Consider this example:
* Salesperson Joe Jones heard that the XYZ Company buyer, Jake Jackson, was displeased with the company's present supplier. Jones had analyzed XYZ's operation and knew that his product could save the company thousands of dollars a year. Imagine Jones's surprise when Jackson terminated the visit quickly with no sale and no mention of a future appointment
* Jones told his boss about the interview: "Jackson kept asking me where I went to schokol, whether I want coffee, and how I liked selling while i was trying to explain to him the features, advantages, and benefits of our product. Suddenly, Jackson stopped the interview". Jones asked the boss, "What did I do wrong? I know he needed our product."
* The buyer was sending Jones signals that he likes doing business with people he knows. He was a "feeler", as discussed in Chapter 3. The buyer did not watn to get get down to business immediately. He wanted to visit for a while. No true communication was ever established between Jackson and Jones, which caused Jones to misread the customer and incorrectly handle the situation.
* Salespeople, as illustrated in this example, often lose sales by failing to recognize3 communication barriers between buyer and seller. The main reasons communication breaks down in the sales situation include these (see Exhibit 4.8)

1. **Differences in perception.** If the buyer and seller do not share a common understanding of information contained in the presentation, communication breaks down. The closer a buyer's and seller's perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs, are the stronger communication will be between them. Cultural differences are easily misperceived by buyers and sellers.
2. **Buyer does not recognize a need for product** Communication barriers exist if the salesperson is unable to convince the buyer of a need, and/or that the salesperson represents the best supplier to buy from.
3. **Selling pressure** There is a fine line between what is acceptable sales pressure or enthusiasm and what the buyer perceives as a high-pressure sales technique. A pushy, arrogant selling style can quickly cause the prospect to erect a communication barrier.
4. **Information overload.** You may present the buyer with an excess of information. The overload may cause confusion, perhaps offend, and the buyer will stop listening. For example, the engineer making a presentation to a buyer who is not an engineer may concentrate on the technical aspects of a product when the buyer only wants a small amount of information.
5. **Disorganized sales presentation** Sales presentations that seem unorganized to the buyer tend to cause frustration or anger. Buyers commonly expect you to understand their needs or problems and to customize your sales presentation to their individual situations. If you fail to do this, communication can fall apart.
6. **Distraction** When a buyer receives a telephone call or someone walks into the office, distractions occur. A buyer's thoughts may become sidetracked, and it may be difficult to regain attention and interest.
7. **Poor listening**. At times, the buyer may not listen to you. This often occurs if you do all or most of the talking--not allowing the buyer to participate in the conversation
8. **How and what you say**. What we say probably affects more people than any other action we take. Here are four common speech patterns. The first two should be copied, and the last two should be avoided

        a. The Controlled Talk--those with this speech pattern think before speaking, know when silence is best, and give wise advice
        b. The Caring Talk--those with this speech pattern speak truthfully while seeking to encourage
        c. The Conniving Talk--those with this speech pattern are filled with wrong motive, gossip, slander, and a desire to twist truth
        d. The Careless Talk--those with this speech pattern are filled with lies, salty language, and quick-tempered words--which can lead to self-destruction in sales

9. **Not adapting to buyer's style** sitting in on a sales call with a young salesperson selling high-priced industrial equipment, it became clear that the two were not communicating. The salesperson, who preferred telling to showing, kept talking about the product. But the visually oriented client wanted to see a picture of it. Eventually, the conversation deteriorated into a show versus tell confrontation.

        It was the classic sales miscommunication. Amazingly, the rep had product brochures in his briefcase. But he didn't bring them out because he was locked into his own form of communication. It is critical for salespeople to use different communication styles as discussed in Chapter 3. Most successful salespeople have learned to match their customers' communication styles. Remember the Golden Rule and adjust to the other peron.

* The nine barriers to communication just listed are not the only ones that may occur. As in the examnple of Joe Jones, the buyer may actually need the product and the salesperson may have excellenet product knowledge and believe that the sales presentation was good, yet because of communication barriers, the buyer reject the salesperson and the product. As a salesperson, constantly seek ways to recognize and overcome communication barriers, and identify and satisfy buyer needs t hrough persuasive communication.

## Master Persuasive Communication to Maintain Control
* To become a better communicator, consider two major element of communication. First, always strive to improve the message and its delivery in the sales presentation. You need to be a capable encoder. Second, improve your ability to determine what the buyer is communicating to you. To do so, you need to be a good listener or decoder. A good sales communicator knows how to effectively encode and decode during a presentation.
* Salespeople want to be good communicators to persuade people to purchase their products. **Persuasion** means the ability to change a person's belief, position, or course of action. The more effective you are at communicating, the greater your chances of being successful at persuasion.
* The chapters on the selling process go into greater detail on specific persuasion techniques. For now, let's review several factors to develop persuasive communications. These factors relate to several components of the communication model shown in Exhibit 4.2: feedback, empathy, simplicity, listening, attitude, and proof statements.

## Feedback Guides Your Presentation
* Learn how to generate feedback to determine whether your listener has received your intended message. Feedback does not refer to any specific type of listening behavior by the buyer but rather to a recognizable response. A shake of the head, a frown, or an effort to say something are all signals to the salesperson. If the salesperson fails to notice or respond to these signals, no feedback can occur, which means faulty or incomplete communication. A salesperson's observation of feedback is like an auto racer's glances at the tachometer. Both aid in ascertaining a receiver's response.
* Often, feedback must be sought openly because the prospect does not always give it voluntarily. By interjecting into the presentation questions that require the customer to give a particular response, you can stimulate feedback. Questioning, sometimes called probing, allows the salesperson to determine the buyer's attitude toward the sales presentation. **Probing** refers to gathering information and uncovering customer needs using one or more questions.

``` 
Don't Complicate Things
* How can you simplify the following statements

1. A mass of concentrated earthly material perennially rotating on its axis will not accumulate an accretion of bryophytic vegetation
2. Individuals who are perforce constrained to be domiciled in vitreous structures of patent frangibility should on no account employ petrous formations as projectils.
3. A superabundance of talent skilled in the preparation of gastronomic concoctions will impair the quality of certain potable solution made by immensing a gallinaceous bird in embullient Adam's ale

Answers
1. A rolling stone gathers no moss
2. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
3. Too many cooks spoil the broth

```

* MCI Communication included this type of feedback in their sales training sessions. MCI sales trainers suggested to their salespeople that they use questions in their presentations. These were some of the questions:

        * Do you think you are paying too much for telecommunications equipment?
        * Are you happy with the service now being provided
        * Are you happy with the equipment your present supplier has installed for your company

* These questions were intended to draw negative responses from the customers concerning the relationship with their present supplier. They provided the MCI salespeople with a method of determining how the prospect felt about the competitor. These responses allow the salesperson to discuss the specific features, advantages, and benefits of MCI products relative to the products the prosepct currently used. Future chapters will fully discuss questioning techniques to use during your presentation.

### Remember the Trial Close
* In planning your presentation, it is important to predetermine when and what feedback producing questions to ask. Remember to use the trial close as part of your SELL Sequence, as discussed in Chapter 3. The use of a question after discussing a benefit is a great method of obtaining feedback. Another way to create positive feedback is through empathy.

## Empathy Puts You in Your Customer's Shoes
* **Empathy** is the ability to identify and understand the other person's feelings, ideas, and situation. As a salesperson, you need to be interested in what the buyer is saying--not just in giving a sales presentation. Many of the barriers to communication mentioned earlier can be overcome when you place yourself in the buyer's shoes. Empathy is saying to a prospect, "I'm here to help you," or "Tell me your problems and needs so I can help you". Empathy is also evidenced by a salesperson's display of sincerity and intereset in the buyer's situation.
* This may mean acknowledging at times that a prospect may not need your product. Take, for example, the Scott Paper Company salesperson who finds that the customer still have 90 percent of the paper towels purchased three months ago. There is no reason to sell this customer more paper towels. It is time to help the customer sell the paper towels now on hand by suggesting displays, price reductions, and formats for newspaper advertisement. it is always wise to adopt your customer's point of view to meet the customer's needs best.

```
Do you Have Any of These Listening Habits
* No one is perfect. We all have some bad listening habits that we get away with when we talk to our family and friends. In a business context, however, leave these bad habits behind and practice active listening. To gain insight into your listening habits, read through this list of common irritating listening habits and be honest with yourself; notice what you are guilty of and use this awareness to begin eliminating them:

        1. You do all the talking
        2. You interrupt when people talk
        3. You never look at the person talking or indicate that you are listening
        4. You start argue before the other person has a chance to finish.
        5. Everything that is said reminds you of an experience you've had, and you feel obligated to digress with a story
        6. You finish sentences for people if they pause too long
        7. You wait impatiently for people to finish so that you can interject something
        8. You work too hard at maintaining eye contact and make people uncomfortable.
        9. You look as if you are appraising the person talking to you, looking him or her up and down as if considering the person for a modeling job
        10. You overdo the feedback you give--too many nods of your head and "uh-huh's".


```

## Keep It Simple
* The new salesperson was sitting in a customer's office waiting for the buyer. his boss was with him. As they heard the buyer come into the office, the sales manager said, "Remember, a KISS for him". No, he was not saying to give the buyera kiss, but to use the old selling philosophy of keep it simple, salesperson.
* The story is told of a little old lady who went into a hardware store. The clerk greeted her and offered her some help. She replied that she was looking for a heater. So the clerk said, "Gee, are you lucky! We have a big sale on these heaters, and a tremendous selection. Let me show you" So after maybe 30 or 45 minutes of discussiing duothermic controls, heat induction, and all the factors involved with how a heater operates, including the features and advantages of each of the 12 models, he turned to the little old lady and said, "Now, do you have any questions" To which she replied, "Yes, just one, Sonny. Which one of these things will keep a little old lady warm?"
* An overly complex, technical presentation should be avoided when it is unnecessary. Use words and materials that the buyer can understand easily. The skilled salesperson can make a prospect feel comfortable with a new product or complex technology through the subtle use of nontechnical information and a respectful attitude.
* Three literary masterpieces, the Lod's Prayer, The Twenty-Third Psalm, and Mr. Lincoln's Gettysbury Address, had few words and no long ones. Recall their phraseology:

        * Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name
        * The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want
        * Four score and seven years ago

* Not a single three-syllable word; hardly any two-syllable words. All of the great things in human life are one-syllable things--love, home, child, wife, trust, faith. As part of your study, watch television, listen to the radio, and read magazine advertisements. All of the great advertisements, generally speaking, use simple, small words. So keep it simple--KISS

## Creating Mutual Trust Develops Friendship
* Salespeople who develop a mutual, trusting relationship with their customers can not help being successful. This type of relationship eventually results in high source credibility and even friendship.
* If a buyer realizes that in the past she was sold products that performed to expectations, the products were worth their price, and the salesperson did everything promsied, she will trust the salesperson in the future. Building mutual trust is important to effective long-run communication.

## Listening Clues You In
* **Hearing** refers to being able to deetct sounds. **Listening** is deriving meaning from sounds that are heard. Everything you hear is not worth your undivided attention; for the salesperson, however, listening is a commuunication skill critical to success.
* Salespeople often believe that their job is to talk rather than to listen. If they both talk and listen, their persuasive powers increase. Since people can listen (about 400 words per minute) roughly twice as fast as the average rate of speech, it is understandable that a person's mind may wander while listening to a salesperson's presentation or that the salesperson may tune out a prospect. To keep the buyer listening, ask questions, get the buyer involved in the conversation, and show visual aids. Once you ask a question, carefully listen to the response.

#### Listen to Words, Feelings, and Thoughts
* This may seem obvious, but when someone speaks to you, the person is expressing thoughts and feelings. Despite the logic of this statement, most of us listen only to the words. Spoken language is an inexact form of communication, but it is the best we have in this stage of human evolution. If you come back 2,000 years from now, perhaps you will communicate with your prospects via mental telepathy. For now, given the limitation of words, look beyond them to hear the entire story.
* Listen behind the words for the emotional content of the message. This is conveyed in the nuances of voice and body language. Some people, such as sensers (discussed in Chapter 3), give you little emotional information. That's all right, because you deal with them in a factual, business-only style. Feelers, on the other hand, reveal their emotions, and in turn, they appreciate your acknowledgement of their feelings. It is appropriate to discuss their feelings and treat them more as friends than as strict busienss associates.
* You can hear the emotion behind the words in several ways. First, look for changes in eye contact. After establishing a comfortable and natural level of eye contact, and sudden deviations from the norm tip you off to emotional content in the message. People tend to look away from you when they talk about something embarrassing. When this happens, make a quick mental note of what it pertained to and treat the subject delicately. Also, give a person the courtesy of looking away momentarily yourself--as if you are saying, "I respect your privacy".
* Listen between the words for what is not said. Some people reveal more in what they don't say. Part of this is due to the emotional content of the message and part is due to the information they give you. A story illustrates this point.
* A salesperson was talking to the president of a large paper mill. "I simply asked him what kind of training he had for his salespeople. He went into a long discourse on all the seminars, training films, videotapes, and cassettes they had from the parent company, suppliers, industry associations, and in-house programs. I sad, listening, and took notes. At the end of his speech I said to him, 'I notice you didn't mention anything about time management for salespeople' He raise his voice and emphatically said, 'You know, just this morning I was talking to a guy and I told him we have to have some time-management training for our salespeople'''
* The lesson here is to get the prospect talking and listening actively--concentrate. Take notes, look for clues to emotions, and don't interrupte or start thinking about your next question.

#### The Three Levels of Listening
* Whenver people listen, they are at one of three basic levels of listening. These levels require various degrees of concentration by the listener. As you move from the first to the third level, the potential for understanding and clear communication increases.

* **Marginal Listening** Marginal listening, the first and lowest level, involves the least concentration, and typically listeners are easily distracted by their thoughts. During periods of marginal listening, a listener exhibits blank stares, nervous mannerism, and gestures that annoy the prospect and ccause communication barriers. The salesperson hears the message but it doesn't sink in. There is enormous room for misunderstanding when a salesperson is not concentrating on what is said. Moreover, the prospect can not help but feel the lack of attention, which may be insulting and diminishes trust. It may be funny when family members continually patronize each other with "Yes dear" regardless of what is said. In real life, however, it is not funny.

        Prospect: What I need, really, is a way to reduce the time lost due to equipment breakdowns
        Salesperson: Yeah, OK. Let's see, uh, the third feature of our product is the convenient sizes you can get

* Salespeople of all experience levels are guilty of marginal listening. Beginners who lack confidence and experience may concentrate so intensely on what they are supposed to say next that they stop listening. Old pros, by contrast, have heard it all before. They have their presentations memorized and want the prospect to hurry and finish talking so the important business can continue. These traditional salespeople forget that the truly important information lies in what the prospect says.

* **Evaluative Listening** Evaluative listening, the second level of listening, requires more concentration and attention to the speaker's words. At this level, the listener actively tries to hear what the prospect says but isn't making an effort to understand the intent. Instead of accepting and trying to understand a prospect's message, the evaluative listener categorizes the statement and concentrates on preparing a response.
* The evaluative listening phenomenon is a result of the tremendous speed at which a human can listen and think. it is no surprise that evaluative listening is the level of listening used most of the tim. Unfortunately, it is a difficult habit to break, but it can be done with practice.

        Prospect: What I need, really, is a way to reduce the time lost due to equipment breakdown.
        Salesperson: (defensively) We have tested our machines in the field, and they don't break down often.

* In this example, the salesperson reacted to one aspect of the prospect's statement. Had the salesperson withheld judgment until the end of the statement, he could have responded more objectively and informatively.
* In evaluative listening, it is easy to be distracted by emotion-laden words. At that point, you aren't listening to the prospect. Instead, you are obsessed with the offensive word and wondering what to do about it. This is a waste of time for both you and the prospect. It increases personal and relationship tension and throws your communication off course. To avoid the problems of marginal and evaluative listening, practice active listening.

SELLING TIPS

Listening Guidelines
* Here are several things to do to improve your listening skills:

        * Stop talking
        * Show the prospect you want to listen
        * Watch for nonverbal messages and project positive signals
        * Recognize feelings and emotions
        * Ask questions to clarify meaning
        * If appropriate, restate the prospect's position for clarification
        * Listen to the full story

```

* **Active Listening** Active listening is the third and most effective level of listening. The active listener refrains from evaluating the message and tries to see the other person's point of view. Attention is not only on the words spoken but also on the thoughts, feelings, and meaning conveyed. Listening in this way means the listener puts herself into someone else's shoes. it requires the listener to give the other person verbal and nonverbal feedback.

        Prospect: What I need is a way to reduce the time lost to equipment breakdowns
        Salesperson: Could you tell me what kind of breakdowns you have experienced.
    
* In this example, the salesperson spoke directly to the prospect's concerns--not around them. Her desire to make a presentation was deferred so she could accomplish a more important task--effectively communicating with the prospect.
* Active listening is a skill that takes practice in the beginning, but after a while, it beomces second nature. The logic behind active listening is based on courtesy and concentration.
* Active listening is sometimes difficult to do, especially for the novice salesperson. The novice may continue to talk about a particular situation or problem. However, the salesperson must learn to listen. it is a key to sales success. People like and appreciate a listener.

#### Technology Helps to Remember
* A distinction must be drawn between listening and remembering. Listening is the process of receiving the message the way the speaker intended to send it. **Memory** is recall over time. Listening and time have profound effects on memory. An untrained listener is likely to understand retain only about 50 percent of a conversation. After 48 hours, the retention rate drops to 25 percent. Think of the implications. Memory of a conversation that occurred more than two days ago may be incomplete and inaccurate. 
* After you leave the prospect's office, take a few minutes to write down, or log in your computer, what occurred during the sales call. This is valuable information for doing what you promised and planning the next sales call. Chapter 5 will discuss much more about the use of technology in communicating with customers.

```
It's Party Time
* You are part of a sales district containing six salespeople. At least once a month, everyone gets together for dinner and sometimes entertainment. This is an aggressive group, very spirited in their discussion of any topic.
* Tonight you sit and listen to one of the salespeople maliciously and wrongfully attack your company and your boss. You can tell that this person is serious and has strong feelings about what is being said.
* What would be the most ethical action to take?

1. Interject with your opinion. This might start a heated debate, but at least you did not compromise your ideals
2. Interject with your opinion during dinner and leave dinner if the negative conversation continues. Sit down with your boss the next day and suggest that he bring the other salesperson in to discuss what the underlying problems are and how they might be resolved.
3. Let him talk. Everybody is entitled to his/her own opinions.

```

#### Your Attitude Makes the Difference
* Although a variety of methods and techniques exist in selling, truly effective sales persuasion is based on the salesperson's attitude toward the sales job and customers. What is the secret of a great sales atttitude? The checklist (see "Today I choose" in margin on page 142) shows you a variety of factors that show customers your attitude toward them. Which of these factors have you chosen to use today?
* Surround these nine factors with **enthusiasm** in yourself to show your excitement toward the customer. Truly being a person radiating these attitudes will create genuine interest in other people. You will be welcomed anywhere. When you walk into the buyer's office, you'll light it up with your selling spirit!

#### Proof Statements Make You Believable
* Salespeople who have established **credibility** with their customers through continued empathy, willingness to listen to specific needs, and continual enthusiasm toward their work and customers' busienss can make claims that some customers may treat as gospel. Enthusiasm combined with proof statements greatly improves a salesperson's persuasive ability.
* Salespeople have known for years that using highly credible sources can improve the persuasiveness of teh sales presentation message. **Proof statements** are statements that substantiate the salesperson's claims. Pharmaceutical companies often quote research studies performed by outstanding physicians at prestigious medical schools to validate claims of product benefits. These proo statements add high credibility to a sales message.
* Salespeople sometimes quote acknowledged experts in a field on the use of products. By demonstrating that other customers or respected individuals use the products, they encourage customer belief in the validity of information presented in a sales presentation. People place greater confidence in a trustworthy, objective source (particularly one not associated with the salesperson's firm) and are therefore more receptive to what the salesperson say.

# Appendix: Dress for Success... and to Impress for Business Professional and Casual Occasions
* You have only one chance to make a favorable first impression. Impressions of you are based upon your appearance. How you are dressed makes a first and lasting impression on those you meet in any situation. The following dress guidelines come from Texas A&M University's Center for Retailing Studies. For men and women you learn the basic guidelines for both business professional and business casual attire.

Busienss Casual Attire:

    The Coat & Shirt: Depending on the occasion, a sport coat with a nice solid or striped button-down shirt is appropriate. Be cautious not to pick anything too loud. Go with conservative colors. If you pick a striped shirt, be sure the stripes are subtle. The coat should be black, navy, gray, or tweed

    The Slacks: Choose a pair of slacks that is equally as professional as your suit pants. They should fit appropriately and coordinate with your shirt. They should be a neutral color such as black, brown, tan, grey, or navy

    The Shoes: Business casual shoes are similar to business professional shoes. They should match your outfit and preferably be leather. Although the shoes are not necessary, be sure to pick a style that is conservative and still professional looking.

    Accessories: Accessories should always be used moderately. A tie is not necessary for business casual attire. The only jewelry you should wear is a gold or silver watch, a wedding band and/or a class ring. Also, always wear dark color socks and be sure the leather of your belt matches your shoes.

    Tips to Remember: The main difference between busienss casual and business professional is that you may not be wearing a suit jacket. Even thouogh it is called business casual, it is important to still look extremely professional. Remember to avoid loud colors. When in doubt, always dress up rather than down.
