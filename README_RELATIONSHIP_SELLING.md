# PREFACE

### Welcome to Relationship Selling through Service
* Obtaining new customers and retaining present ones are the main challenges of salespeople. Increase in sales and profits is up to the sales personnel--the people who represent their employers through interacting with present or prospective customers. Sales professionals strive to create a long-term business relationship, which implies that personal relationships with clients are formed. Consumers want to buy from someone who cares about their needs. People do business with the people they trust, and they trust the people they know.
* A megatrend in today's business world involves going to extreme effort to meet consumer needs. Organizations can not afford to lose customers. It is always easier to sell to a satisfied customer than an unsatisfied one. The cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than keeping a present customer.
* The textbook focuses on taking care of the customer through exceptional customer service. **Service means making a contribution to the welfare of others. Salespeople exist to help others.**

### New Additions, Expansions, and Reexamination to this Edition
* Using this textbook each year in my sales classes has resulted in a constant study of the text by students who provide feedback on its content. Present users of the textbook have offered detailed critiques providing direction for revision of the book, as have the reviewers noted in the Acknowledgements. For this edition, I carefully reread the book to ensure that the text better reflects my thoughts and ideas on the subject. The relationships and interactions in the various steps of the selling process have been carefully examined to form a more seamless flow from one chapter to the next, and special emphasis is placed on the importance of ethical behavior in working with prospects and customers.
* ABC's of Selling trains readers on a specific, yet generic, step-by-step selling process that is universal in nature. Once learned, a student has the basic background to sell any product. Arguably, no other personal selling textbook presents a sales process or system in a logical sequence: from planning and the approach, to closing and follow-up for exceptional customer service. Scores of sales personnel in thee industry today comment on how this textbook reflects what they do on sales calls with prospects and customers. The goal of ABC's of Selling has always been to demonstrate to students the order of steps within the selling process; provide numerous examples of what should be in each step; and explain how the steps within the selling process interact with one another. If students understand the sales system by the end of the course, the class has successfully contribute to their eduction.

### Examples of New Additions
* ABC's of Selling is a market leader in sales classes worldwide, and its materials can be found in four international versions. Numerous sales trainers around the globe use our selling process to prepare their salespeople.

### The Uniqueness of ABC's of Selling
8 The appendix to Chapter 1, "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson," reveals this textbook's unique central focus--serving others unselfishly. To aid in this message, the acclaimed worldwide Golden Rule was incorporated in order to stress treating others as you would like to be treated in the marketplace and workplace.
* The textbook's foundation is based upon service. **Its cornerstone is love (caring) of others.** ABC's of Selling's values are supported by the pillars of an organization's--and individual's--integrity, trustworthiness, and character. The center of business and personal life revoles around personal interactions; as a result, a theme of this textbook is that ethical service, based upon truth between people, build strong long-term relationships.
* ABC's of Selling seeks to prepare people for the 21st century's demand for moral and ethical treatment--a universal declaration for human rights. It is a calling for a higher standard than what previously exists in many organizations worldwide. The General Assembly of the United Unations has proclaimed that humans possess reason and conscience, and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood. **Organizations should not be engaged in war within the marketplace, but committed to serving humanmind.**
* Many people seem to separate their personal life from their business life. Some individuals, when entering the business world, tend to follow the example of others to generate sales. The use of this textbook in your classroom may provide some students with a final opportunity to discuss how to enter the rat race without becoming a rat.

### ABC's Approach
* ABC's of Selling was conceived as a method of providing ample materials that allow readers to construct their own sales presentations after studying the text. This allows the instructor the flexibility of focusing on the "how-to-sell" approach within the classroom. Covering the basic foundations for understanding the concepts and practices of selling in a practical, straightforward, and readable manner, it provides students with a guide to use in preparing sales presentations and role-playing exercises.

### The Philosophy behind This Book
* The title should help you understand the philosophy of this book. A student of sales should understand the fundamentals--the basics--of personal selling. All of them. I do not advocate one way of selling as the best route to success. There are many roads to reaching one's goals.
* I do feel a salesperson should have an assortment of selling skills and should be very knowledgeable, even an expert, in the field. Based on the situation, the salesperson determines the appropriate actions to take for a particular prospect or customer. No matter what the situation, however, the basic fundamentals of selling can be applied.
* There is no place in our society for high-pressure, manipulative selling. The salesperson is a problem solver, a helper, and an advisor to the customer. **If the customer has no need, the salesperson should accept that and move on to help another person or firm.** If the customer has a need, however, the salesperson should and must go for the sale. **All successful salespeople I know feel that once they determine that the customer is going to buy someone's product--and that their product will satisfy that customer's needs--it is their job to muster all their enter, skill, and know-hwo to make that sale. That is what it's all about!**
* It is my sincere hope that after the reader has studied this book, he or she will say, "There's a lot more to selling than I ever imagined." I hope many people will feel that this material can help them earn a living and that selling is a great occupation and career.
* At the end of the course, I hope all the students will have learned how to prepare and give a sales presentation by visually, verbally, and nonverbally communicating their message. I know of no other marketing course whose class project is so challenging and where so much learning takes place.
* Finally, I hope each student realizes that these new communication skills can be applied to all aspects of life. Once learned and internalized, selling skills will help a person be a better commnicator throughout life.

### Basic Organization of the Book
* The publisher and I work hard to ensure that ABC's of Selling would provide students with the basic foundation for understanding all major aspects of selling. The 14 chapters in the text are divided into four parts:

        * Selling as a profession. Emphasizes the history, career, rewards, and duties of the professional salesperson and illustrates the importance of the sales function to the organization's success. It also examines the social, ethical, and legal issues in selling.
        * Preparation for Relationship Selling. Presents the background information salespeople use to deveolop their sales presentations
        * The Relationship Selling Process. At the heart of this book, this part covers the entire selling process from prospecting to follow-up. State-of-the-art selling strategies, practices, and techniques are presented in a "how-to" fashion.
        * Time and Territory Management: Keys to Success. The importance of the proper use and management of one's time and sales territory is given through coverage.

### Special to This Edition
* Ethics Emphasized. Unselfish and ethical service to the customer underscores the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--a sales philosohpy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated without expecting reciprocity. This is how to build long-term relationships with customers.
* The Tree of Business Life Icon. Beginning with Chapter 1, The Tree of Business Life icon is used to remind the reader of one the main themes of the book. This theme emphasizes that by providing ethical service you build true relationships. This section was developed in hopes of having the reader consider how a salesperson would incorporate ethical service into the chpater's topic.
* The Golden Rule Icon. The Golden Rule icon appears in each chapter to help reinforce the Tree of Business Life. The combination of the Golden Rule and the "Tree" guidelines for business and selling forms the core theme of this textbook. Unselfishly treating prosepcts/customers as you would like to be treated without expecting something in return results in ethical service that builds true long-term relationships. If you think about it, this is how you build true personal friends. Why not build your business relationships on this rock?
* Video cases. Cases 2.1, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5A, 7.3, 10.3, 12.4, 13.3 can be used independently or with eight of the videos accompanying this book. Each of the eight cases highlights a tough ethical dilemma often faced by sales personnel in today's competitive marketplace. use any of all of these cases to emphasize ethics in your sales class.
* Sales Call Role-Plays and ProSelling Videos. The first three of the four role-plays in Appendix A at the back of this book have videos created incorporating our selling process. The two people featured in the three role-plays completed my selling course. The professional selling materials in Chapter 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 do a great job in illustrating. Actually usedf in my classes by hundreds of students, these role-plays are created from information used by today's top sales forces.
* Sell Yourself on a Job Interview. The all-time favorite role-play is in Appendix B with other expierential exercises. For years I have used this student pleaser in both my personal selling and sales management classes. When students see themselves on video, they quickly realize what needs to be done for a professional interview. You have to try this exercise one time.
* Student Application Learning Exercises (SALES). Chapters directly related to creating the role-play have SALES that aid students in better understanding how to construct this popular class project. These were first used in my classes in the fall of 1997. Students unaimously felt they were great in helping them correctly construct their role-plays. SALES appear at the end of Chapters 3, 5A, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
* Sales Careers. Career information has been expanded throughout so students will better understand that there are sales jobs in all organizations--business, service, and nonprofit
* Selling Experiential Exercises. These end-of-chapter exercises help students better understand themselves and/or the text material. Many can be done in class or completed outside and discussed in class.
* Selling Globally Appendix. Many of these were writen by friends and colleagues from countries around the world. They are at the back of the book.
* Technology in Selling. A central theme within each chapter shows the use of technology and automation in selling and servicing prospects and customers.

FACING A SALES CHALLEGE
* Debra Hutchins majored in French, with a minor in English literature, at Washiongton University in St. Louis. After graduation she began working as a secretary in the marketing department at Sunwest Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
* "I had never considered a sales job while in school, and sales didn't appeal to me when I began work at the bank. I always felt you would have to be an extrovert. I'm more the shy, intellectual type. I don't see myselfin the role of a salesperson.
* "Someday I do want a more challenging job. I'm a very hard worker, long hours don't bother me. I've always had a need to achieve success. One of the things I like about being a secretary is helping customers when they call the bank. It is important tocarefully listen to their problems or what they want in order to provide good customer service. Maybe one day I'll find a job that has more challenge, professionalism, and reward."
* If youwere in Debra's position, what would you do? What types of jobs would you recommend she consider?

```

* Debra Hutchins is like many people in that while she was in school a career in sales did not seem like the thing to do. Most people are unfamiliar with what salespeople do.
* As you learn more about the world of sales, a career selling goods or services may become appealing. The salesperson makes valuable contribution to our quality of life by selling goods and services that benefit individual and industry. Red Motley, former editor of Parade magazine, once said, "Nothing happens until somebody sells something." Selling brings in the money and causes cash registers across the country to ring. For centuries, the salespeople of the world have caused goods and services to change hands.
* More than ever, today's salespeople are a dynamic power in the business world. They generate more revenue in the U.S. economy than workers in any other profession. The efforts of salespeople have a direct impact on such diverse areas as these:

        * Ensuring the success of new products
        * Keeping existing products on the retailer's shelf
        * Constructing manufacturing facilities
        * Opening businesses and keeping them open
        * Generating sales orders that result in the loading of trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, andpipelines that carry goods to customer all over the world.

* The salesperson is engaged in a highly honorable, challenging, rewarding, and professional career. In this chapter, you are introduced to the career, rewards, and duties of the salesperson. The chapter begins by reltaing an organization's business purpose to its marketing efforts.

## What is the Purpose of Business?
* **The purpose of business is to increase the general well-being of humandkind through the sales of goods and services.** This requires making a profit in order to operate the business and provide beneficial products to the marketplace. Profit is a means to an end. Reduced t obasics, businesses have two major functions: production of goods or creation of services and marketing those goods and services.

## The Primary Goal of Business
* The primary goal of business should be to transform the marketplace and workplace into an environment where everyone is  treated as they would like to be treated. Business should be fair to all parties involved in both the buying and selling of goods and services.

## Marketing's Definition
* There are numerous definition of marketing. Your book will use the American Marketing Association's definition:

        Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.

* The **marketing concept** is a business philosophy that says the customers' want-satisfaction is the economic and social jkustification for a firm's existence. Consequently, all company activities should be devoted to determining customers' wants and then satisfying them, while still making a profit.


## Essentials of a Firm's Marketing Effort
* The essentials of a firm's marketing effort include its ability 1) to determine the needs of its customers and 2) to create and maintain an effective marketing mix that satisfy customer needs. As shown in Exhibit 1.1, **a firm's marketing mix consists of four main elements--product, price, distribution or place, and promotion**--a marketing manager uses to market goods and services. It is the marketing manager's responsibility to determine how best to use each element in the firm's marketing efforts.

## Product: It's More than You Think
* A **good** is a physical object that can be purchased. A radio, a house, and a car are examples of a good. A **service** is an action or activity done for others for a fee. Lawyers, plumbers, teachers, and taxicab drivers perform services. **The term product refers to both goods and services**.
* So, what is a product? When you think of a product, most likely you imagine some tangible object you can touch, such as a radio or automobile. However, there is more to a product than you think.
* A **product** is a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes, including packagin, color, and brand, plus the services and even the reputation of the seller. People buy more than a set of physical attributes. They buy want-satisfaction such as what the product will do, its quality, and the image of owning the product.

## Price: It's Important to Success
* The corporate marketing department also determines each product's initial price. This process involves establishing each product's normal price and possible special discount prices. Since product price often is critical to customers, it is important part of the marketing mix. **Price** refers to the value of worth of a product that attracts the buyer to exchange money or something of value for the product.

```

## Distribution: It has to be Available
* The marketing manager also determines the best method of distributing the product. Distribution refers to the channel structure used to transfer products from an organization to its customers. It is important to have the product available to custoemrs in a convenient and accessible location when they want it.

## Promotion: You have to Tell People about it
* Promotion, as part of the marketing mix, increases company sales by communicating product information to potential custoemrs. The four basic parts of a firm's promotional effort are 1) personal selling, 2) advertising, 3) public relations, and 4) sales promotion. Example of each marketing mix ingredient are shown in Exhibit 1.2. The company's sales force is one segment of the firm's promotional effort. Salespeople are part of the organization's sales force. So what is the job of the salesperson?

## What is Selling
* Many people consider selling and marketing synonymous terms. However, selling is actually only one of the many marketing components. In business, a traditional definition of personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to persuade a prospective customer to buy something--a good, service, idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.
* This definition of selling involves a person helping another person. The salesperson often works with prospects or customers to examine their needs, provide information, suggest a product to meet their needs, and provide after-the-sale service to ensure long-term satisfaction.
* The definition also involves communications between seller and buyer. **The salesperson and the buyer discuss needs and talk about the product relative to how it will satisfy the person's needs. If the product is what the person needs, then the salesperson attempts to persuade the prospect to buy it.
* Unfortunately this explanation of personal selling does not explain the best selling philosohpy for the 21st century. Why?

## Personal Selling Today
* In the early 2000s the worst side of American business became obvious. Corporate corruption, misstated financials, and the personal profit of chief executives as their companies went out of business all contributed to the public's negative attitude toward most, if not all, business professions. Unethical business practices resulted in bankruptcies, which in turn led to massive layoffs across the country. This had an impact on all Americans and their families, leaving no person or organization untouched.

## How Some Salespeople are Viewed
* Each year, from 1977 to 2001, Gallup (one of America's leading pollsters) has found that insurance salespeople, advertising practitioners, and used car salespeople are the three lowest-rated job categories on perceived honesty and ethical standards. Which of the three would you say rated the lowest each year? Yes, it was the used car salesperson! Unfortunately, people tend to generalize from such research findings that most salespeople are not honest or ethical, which is not the case. I know used car salespeople with the highest of ethical standards. Be careful in making a hasty decision about salesperson. You cannot judge a book by its cover. You may be dealing with a sheep in wolf's clothing.

## What about You?
* How do you view the honesty and ethical standards of today's businesses and salespeople? For the last several years, at the beginning of my classes, I have asked sales students the following three questions on a poll found on my website:

        1. What does the general public think about salespeople? Only 10 percent of the almost 2,000 respondents had a positive attitude
        2. What do you think about salespeople? Thirty-five percent had a positive attitude
        3. After graduation, would you accept a sales job? Forty-five percent said "yes".

* These percentage do not represent high marks from my students. What are your answers to these three questions?
* What would you say is the number one reason for salespeople's low ratings on honesty and ethics? It is trust. Many people feel they may not be able to trust a salesperson. Why? Greed is often the answer! The love of money is the root of all kinds of problems. From the least of us to the greatest, we all seem to be greedy to some extent, and greed can make some people blind to all else around them. Given all that has gone on in America as we are revising this textbook, we will use a different definition of selling in your book from the traditional view. This difference is very important given the present status of business in America and the public's--maybe even your--view of salespeople.

### A New Definition of Personal Selling
* The new deinition inserts the word unselfish into the traditional definition discussed earlier. it is that simple! **Personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to unselfishly persuade a prospective customer to buy somethin--a good, a service, an idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.**
* This definition of selling involves the many things we discussed before, such as a person helping another person through selling. However, when the word unselfishly is added to the definition, it makes a big difference in how someone might look at selling. The word unselfish tells salespeople to be caring toward customers and to serve--help--the person or organization without expecting to get something in return. If you are still wondering about the "unselfish" approach to selling, think of the analogy of selling to your grandmother.

### Think of Your Grandmother
* Think of your, or your best friend's, grandmother. Would you treat her in a selfish manner? Would you sell her something just to make a sale? No way! You would not take advantage of Granny. Salespeople should handle their customers with unselfish and ethical service. How are you going to build a long-term relationship with customers unless you treat them unselfishly by placing their interests first?
* **Tell the truth about what the product will do, give the best price on the best product for the need, deliver on time, and provide outstanding follow-up service to make sure the customer is delighted with the purchase. If it is not the right product for the need expressed, tell the customer. If she or he still wants to buy--sell it to the customer!** After all, you, the saleperson, may be wrong.
* Or would you walk away from the sale as Ann Coombs did with a prospect? The chief executive officer (CEO) of a multinational bank wanted to hire her to boost the productivity of his New York staff--a group of people who were struggling to copy after escaping their World Trade Center offices on September 11, 2001. Ann told the CEo that in order to fix it, she had to know what these people were feeling--they had to be able to talk openly about their grief. The CEO wanted absolutely no discussion of fear or grieving. Coombs says it was a six-figure contract. She turned it down because she felt employees were not being treated as they should be treated.
* What would you do? Sell someone something you feel they do not need or refuse to make the sale? That is what salepeople face in their jobs. Oh, a few months later Ann Coombs was contracted to work with the Bush administration to help government department deal with the post-September 11,2001, world. She took that job!

### The Golden Rule of Personal Selling
* When asked, "What would you like to learn in this course?" Steven Osborne, a student in my personal selling class, said, "I would like to know how to believe in a profession that many people do not trust." I sincerely hope you will be a believer in the value of sales integrity at the end of this sales course and be able to give Steven a positive perspective.
* Part of your answer will involve your understanding the definition of personal selling discussed earlier and the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. A rule is a prescribed guide for conduct or action. The **Golden Rule of Personal Selling** refers to the sales philosophy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated. Reciprocity is not expected. Read the short essay at the back of this chapter in the Appendix titled "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson". This short story illustrates the importance of helping people through our jobs and our lives.
* Exhibit 2.7 in Chapter 2 provides examples of how people around the world view the Golden Rule. As you study the vaiours statements of the Golden Rule in Exhibit 2.7, be sure to note that all are phrased negatively except one--the last one. The negative form would teach behavior in this way: If you do not like to get cheated in a purchase, don't cheat others. The positive form, on the other hand, would say that if you like to receive the best price, then offer the best price to your customers.
* To help you understand the concept better, consider how the Golden Rule applies to a litter of kittens. one child watched in delight as the tiny kittens snuggled together, in the cardboard box where hercat had just delivered the litter. "Aw, isn't that cute?" She exclaimed. "They love each other so much that they're trying to keep each other warm." "Well not exactly", relied her mother. "Actually they're trying to keep themselves warm". The Golden Rule is all about trying to keep somebody else warm, even if it means that we get cold in the process. Stop a minute and think about how this applies to your life and the business world. This important concept will be applied to personal selling throughout the textbook. It is especially effective in explaining differences in salespeople and why so many people may have a negative view of some salespeople and a positive view of other salespeople
