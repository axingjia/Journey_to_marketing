# PREFACE

### Welcome to Relationship Selling through Service
* Obtaining new customers and retaining present ones are the main challenges of salespeople. Increase in sales and profits is up to the sales personnel--the people who represent their employers through interacting with present or prospective customers. Sales professionals strive to create a long-term business relationship, which implies that personal relationships with clients are formed. Consumers want to buy from someone who cares about their needs. People do business with the people they trust, and they trust the people they know.
* A megatrend in today's business world involves going to extreme effort to meet consumer needs. Organizations can not afford to lose customers. It is always easier to sell to a satisfied customer than an unsatisfied one. The cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than keeping a present customer.
* The textbook focuses on taking care of the customer through exceptional customer service. **Service means making a contribution to the welfare of others. Salespeople exist to help others.**

### New Additions, Expansions, and Reexamination to this Edition
* Using this textbook each year in my sales classes has resulted in a constant study of the text by students who provide feedback on its content. Present users of the textbook have offered detailed critiques providing direction for revision of the book, as have the reviewers noted in the Acknowledgements. For this edition, I carefully reread the book to ensure that the text better reflects my thoughts and ideas on the subject. The relationships and interactions in the various steps of the selling process have been carefully examined to form a more seamless flow from one chapter to the next, and special emphasis is placed on the importance of ethical behavior in working with prospects and customers.
* ABC's of Selling trains readers on a specific, yet generic, step-by-step selling process that is universal in nature. Once learned, a student has the basic background to sell any product. Arguably, no other personal selling textbook presents a sales process or system in a logical sequence: from planning and the approach, to closing and follow-up for exceptional customer service. Scores of sales personnel in thee industry today comment on how this textbook reflects what they do on sales calls with prospects and customers. The goal of ABC's of Selling has always been to demonstrate to students the order of steps within the selling process; provide numerous examples of what should be in each step; and explain how the steps within the selling process interact with one another. If students understand the sales system by the end of the course, the class has successfully contribute to their eduction.

### Examples of New Additions
* ABC's of Selling is a market leader in sales classes worldwide, and its materials can be found in four international versions. Numerous sales trainers around the globe use our selling process to prepare their salespeople.

### The Uniqueness of ABC's of Selling
8 The appendix to Chapter 1, "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson," reveals this textbook's unique central focus--serving others unselfishly. To aid in this message, the acclaimed worldwide Golden Rule was incorporated in order to stress treating others as you would like to be treated in the marketplace and workplace.
* The textbook's foundation is based upon service. **Its cornerstone is love (caring) of others.** ABC's of Selling's values are supported by the pillars of an organization's--and individual's--integrity, trustworthiness, and character. The center of business and personal life revoles around personal interactions; as a result, a theme of this textbook is that ethical service, based upon truth between people, build strong long-term relationships.
* ABC's of Selling seeks to prepare people for the 21st century's demand for moral and ethical treatment--a universal declaration for human rights. It is a calling for a higher standard than what previously exists in many organizations worldwide. The General Assembly of the United Unations has proclaimed that humans possess reason and conscience, and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood. **Organizations should not be engaged in war within the marketplace, but committed to serving humanmind.**
* Many people seem to separate their personal life from their business life. Some individuals, when entering the business world, tend to follow the example of others to generate sales. The use of this textbook in your classroom may provide some students with a final opportunity to discuss how to enter the rat race without becoming a rat.

### ABC's Approach
* ABC's of Selling was conceived as a method of providing ample materials that allow readers to construct their own sales presentations after studying the text. This allows the instructor the flexibility of focusing on the "how-to-sell" approach within the classroom. Covering the basic foundations for understanding the concepts and practices of selling in a practical, straightforward, and readable manner, it provides students with a guide to use in preparing sales presentations and role-playing exercises.

### The Philosophy behind This Book
* The title should help you understand the philosophy of this book. A student of sales should understand the fundamentals--the basics--of personal selling. All of them. I do not advocate one way of selling as the best route to success. There are many roads to reaching one's goals.
* I do feel a salesperson should have an assortment of selling skills and should be very knowledgeable, even an expert, in the field. Based on the situation, the salesperson determines the appropriate actions to take for a particular prospect or customer. No matter what the situation, however, the basic fundamentals of selling can be applied.
* There is no place in our society for high-pressure, manipulative selling. The salesperson is a problem solver, a helper, and an advisor to the customer. **If the customer has no need, the salesperson should accept that and move on to help another person or firm.** If the customer has a need, however, the salesperson should and must go for the sale. **All successful salespeople I know feel that once they determine that the customer is going to buy someone's product--and that their product will satisfy that customer's needs--it is their job to muster all their enter, skill, and know-hwo to make that sale. That is what it's all about!**
* It is my sincere hope that after the reader has studied this book, he or she will say, "There's a lot more to selling than I ever imagined." I hope many people will feel that this material can help them earn a living and that selling is a great occupation and career.
* At the end of the course, I hope all the students will have learned how to prepare and give a sales presentation by visually, verbally, and nonverbally communicating their message. I know of no other marketing course whose class project is so challenging and where so much learning takes place.
* Finally, I hope each student realizes that these new communication skills can be applied to all aspects of life. Once learned and internalized, selling skills will help a person be a better commnicator throughout life.

### Basic Organization of the Book
* The publisher and I work hard to ensure that ABC's of Selling would provide students with the basic foundation for understanding all major aspects of selling. The 14 chapters in the text are divided into four parts:

        * Selling as a profession. Emphasizes the history, career, rewards, and duties of the professional salesperson and illustrates the importance of the sales function to the organization's success. It also examines the social, ethical, and legal issues in selling.
        * Preparation for Relationship Selling. Presents the background information salespeople use to deveolop their sales presentations
        * The Relationship Selling Process. At the heart of this book, this part covers the entire selling process from prospecting to follow-up. State-of-the-art selling strategies, practices, and techniques are presented in a "how-to" fashion.
        * Time and Territory Management: Keys to Success. The importance of the proper use and management of one's time and sales territory is given through coverage.

### Special to This Edition
* Ethics Emphasized. Unselfish and ethical service to the customer underscores the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--a sales philosohpy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated without expecting reciprocity. This is how to build long-term relationships with customers.
* The Tree of Business Life Icon. Beginning with Chapter 1, The Tree of Business Life icon is used to remind the reader of one the main themes of the book. This theme emphasizes that by providing ethical service you build true relationships. This section was developed in hopes of having the reader consider how a salesperson would incorporate ethical service into the chpater's topic.
* The Golden Rule Icon. The Golden Rule icon appears in each chapter to help reinforce the Tree of Business Life. The combination of the Golden Rule and the "Tree" guidelines for business and selling forms the core theme of this textbook. Unselfishly treating prosepcts/customers as you would like to be treated without expecting something in return results in ethical service that builds true long-term relationships. If you think about it, this is how you build true personal friends. Why not build your business relationships on this rock?
* Video cases. Cases 2.1, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5A, 7.3, 10.3, 12.4, 13.3 can be used independently or with eight of the videos accompanying this book. Each of the eight cases highlights a tough ethical dilemma often faced by sales personnel in today's competitive marketplace. use any of all of these cases to emphasize ethics in your sales class.
* Sales Call Role-Plays and ProSelling Videos. The first three of the four role-plays in Appendix A at the back of this book have videos created incorporating our selling process. The two people featured in the three role-plays completed my selling course. The professional selling materials in Chapter 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 do a great job in illustrating. Actually usedf in my classes by hundreds of students, these role-plays are created from information used by today's top sales forces.
* Sell Yourself on a Job Interview. The all-time favorite role-play is in Appendix B with other expierential exercises. For years I have used this student pleaser in both my personal selling and sales management classes. When students see themselves on video, they quickly realize what needs to be done for a professional interview. You have to try this exercise one time.
* Student Application Learning Exercises (SALES). Chapters directly related to creating the role-play have SALES that aid students in better understanding how to construct this popular class project. These were first used in my classes in the fall of 1997. Students unaimously felt they were great in helping them correctly construct their role-plays. SALES appear at the end of Chapters 3, 5A, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
* Sales Careers. Career information has been expanded throughout so students will better understand that there are sales jobs in all organizations--business, service, and nonprofit
* Selling Experiential Exercises. These end-of-chapter exercises help students better understand themselves and/or the text material. Many can be done in class or completed outside and discussed in class.
* Selling Globally Appendix. Many of these were writen by friends and colleagues from countries around the world. They are at the back of the book.
* Technology in Selling. A central theme within each chapter shows the use of technology and automation in selling and servicing prospects and customers.

FACING A SALES CHALLEGE
* Debra Hutchins majored in French, with a minor in English literature, at Washiongton University in St. Louis. After graduation she began working as a secretary in the marketing department at Sunwest Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
* "I had never considered a sales job while in school, and sales didn't appeal to me when I began work at the bank. I always felt you would have to be an extrovert. I'm more the shy, intellectual type. I don't see myselfin the role of a salesperson.
* "Someday I do want a more challenging job. I'm a very hard worker, long hours don't bother me. I've always had a need to achieve success. One of the things I like about being a secretary is helping customers when they call the bank. It is important tocarefully listen to their problems or what they want in order to provide good customer service. Maybe one day I'll find a job that has more challenge, professionalism, and reward."
* If youwere in Debra's position, what would you do? What types of jobs would you recommend she consider?

```

* Debra Hutchins is like many people in that while she was in school a career in sales did not seem like the thing to do. Most people are unfamiliar with what salespeople do.
* As you learn more about the world of sales, a career selling goods or services may become appealing. The salesperson makes valuable contribution to our quality of life by selling goods and services that benefit individual and industry. Red Motley, former editor of Parade magazine, once said, "Nothing happens until somebody sells something." Selling brings in the money and causes cash registers across the country to ring. For centuries, the salespeople of the world have caused goods and services to change hands.
* More than ever, today's salespeople are a dynamic power in the business world. They generate more revenue in the U.S. economy than workers in any other profession. The efforts of salespeople have a direct impact on such diverse areas as these:

        * Ensuring the success of new products
        * Keeping existing products on the retailer's shelf
        * Constructing manufacturing facilities
        * Opening businesses and keeping them open
        * Generating sales orders that result in the loading of trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, andpipelines that carry goods to customer all over the world.

* The salesperson is engaged in a highly honorable, challenging, rewarding, and professional career. In this chapter, you are introduced to the career, rewards, and duties of the salesperson. The chapter begins by reltaing an organization's business purpose to its marketing efforts.

## What is the Purpose of Business?
* **The purpose of business is to increase the general well-being of humandkind through the sales of goods and services.** This requires making a profit in order to operate the business and provide beneficial products to the marketplace. Profit is a means to an end. Reduced t obasics, businesses have two major functions: production of goods or creation of services and marketing those goods and services.

## The Primary Goal of Business
* The primary goal of business should be to transform the marketplace and workplace into an environment where everyone is  treated as they would like to be treated. Business should be fair to all parties involved in both the buying and selling of goods and services.

## Marketing's Definition
* There are numerous definition of marketing. Your book will use the American Marketing Association's definition:

        Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.

* The **marketing concept** is a business philosophy that says the customers' want-satisfaction is the economic and social jkustification for a firm's existence. Consequently, all company activities should be devoted to determining customers' wants and then satisfying them, while still making a profit.


## Essentials of a Firm's Marketing Effort
* The essentials of a firm's marketing effort include its ability 1) to determine the needs of its customers and 2) to create and maintain an effective marketing mix that satisfy customer needs. As shown in Exhibit 1.1, **a firm's marketing mix consists of four main elements--product, price, distribution or place, and promotion**--a marketing manager uses to market goods and services. It is the marketing manager's responsibility to determine how best to use each element in the firm's marketing efforts.

## Product: It's More than You Think
* A **good** is a physical object that can be purchased. A radio, a house, and a car are examples of a good. A **service** is an action or activity done for others for a fee. Lawyers, plumbers, teachers, and taxicab drivers perform services. **The term product refers to both goods and services**.
* So, what is a product? When you think of a product, most likely you imagine some tangible object you can touch, such as a radio or automobile. However, there is more to a product than you think.
* A **product** is a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes, including packagin, color, and brand, plus the services and even the reputation of the seller. People buy more than a set of physical attributes. They buy want-satisfaction such as what the product will do, its quality, and the image of owning the product.

## Price: It's Important to Success
* The corporate marketing department also determines each product's initial price. This process involves establishing each product's normal price and possible special discount prices. Since product price often is critical to customers, it is important part of the marketing mix. **Price** refers to the value of worth of a product that attracts the buyer to exchange money or something of value for the product.

```

    * Trade shows

```

## Distribution: It has to be Available
* The marketing manager also determines the best method of distributing the product. Distribution refers to the channel structure used to transfer products from an organization to its customers. It is important to have the product available to custoemrs in a convenient and accessible location when they want it.

## Promotion: You have to Tell People about it
* Promotion, as part of the marketing mix, increases company sales by communicating product information to potential custoemrs. The four basic parts of a firm's promotional effort are 1) personal selling, 2) advertising, 3) public relations, and 4) sales promotion. Example of each marketing mix ingredient are shown in Exhibit 1.2. The company's sales force is one segment of the firm's promotional effort. Salespeople are part of the organization's sales force. So what is the job of the salesperson?

## What is Selling
* Many people consider selling and marketing synonymous terms. However, selling is actually only one of the many marketing components. In business, a traditional definition of personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to persuade a prospective customer to buy something--a good, service, idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.
* This definition of selling involves a person helping another person. The salesperson often works with prospects or customers to examine their needs, provide information, suggest a product to meet their needs, and provide after-the-sale service to ensure long-term satisfaction.
* The definition also involves communications between seller and buyer. **The salesperson and the buyer discuss needs and talk about the product relative to how it will satisfy the person's needs. If the product is what the person needs, then the salesperson attempts to persuade the prospect to buy it.
* Unfortunately this explanation of personal selling does not explain the best selling philosohpy for the 21st century. Why?

## Personal Selling Today
* In the early 2000s the worst side of American business became obvious. Corporate corruption, misstated financials, and the personal profit of chief executives as their companies went out of business all contributed to the public's negative attitude toward most, if not all, business professions. Unethical business practices resulted in bankruptcies, which in turn led to massive layoffs across the country. This had an impact on all Americans and their families, leaving no person or organization untouched.

## How Some Salespeople are Viewed
* Each year, from 1977 to 2001, Gallup (one of America's leading pollsters) has found that insurance salespeople, advertising practitioners, and used car salespeople are the three lowest-rated job categories on perceived honesty and ethical standards. Which of the three would you say rated the lowest each year? Yes, it was the used car salesperson! Unfortunately, people tend to generalize from such research findings that most salespeople are not honest or ethical, which is not the case. I know used car salespeople with the highest of ethical standards. Be careful in making a hasty decision about salesperson. You cannot judge a book by its cover. You may be dealing with a sheep in wolf's clothing.

## What about You?
* How do you view the honesty and ethical standards of today's businesses and salespeople? For the last several years, at the beginning of my classes, I have asked sales students the following three questions on a poll found on my website:

        1. What does the general public think about salespeople? Only 10 percent of the almost 2,000 respondents had a positive attitude
        2. What do you think about salespeople? Thirty-five percent had a positive attitude
        3. After graduation, would you accept a sales job? Forty-five percent said "yes".

* These percentage do not represent high marks from my students. What are your answers to these three questions?
* What would you say is the number one reason for salespeople's low ratings on honesty and ethics? It is trust. Many people feel they may not be able to trust a salesperson. Why? Greed is often the answer! The love of money is the root of all kinds of problems. From the least of us to the greatest, we all seem to be greedy to some extent, and greed can make some people blind to all else around them. Given all that has gone on in America as we are revising this textbook, we will use a different definition of selling in your book from the traditional view. This difference is very important given the present status of business in America and the public's--maybe even your--view of salespeople.

### A New Definition of Personal Selling
* The new deinition inserts the word unselfish into the traditional definition discussed earlier. it is that simple! **Personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to unselfishly persuade a prospective customer to buy somethin--a good, a service, an idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.**
* This definition of selling involves the many things we discussed before, such as a person helping another person through selling. However, when the word unselfishly is added to the definition, it makes a big difference in how someone might look at selling. The word unselfish tells salespeople to be caring toward customers and to serve--help--the person or organization without expecting to get something in return. If you are still wondering about the "unselfish" approach to selling, think of the analogy of selling to your grandmother.

### Think of Your Grandmother
* Think of your, or your best friend's, grandmother. Would you treat her in a selfish manner? Would you sell her something just to make a sale? No way! You would not take advantage of Granny. Salespeople should handle their customers with unselfish and ethical service. How are you going to build a long-term relationship with customers unless you treat them unselfishly by placing their interests first?
* **Tell the truth about what the product will do, give the best price on the best product for the need, deliver on time, and provide outstanding follow-up service to make sure the customer is delighted with the purchase. If it is not the right product for the need expressed, tell the customer. If she or he still wants to buy--sell it to the customer!** After all, you, the saleperson, may be wrong.
* Or would you walk away from the sale as Ann Coombs did with a prospect? The chief executive officer (CEO) of a multinational bank wanted to hire her to boost the productivity of his New York staff--a group of people who were struggling to copy after escaping their World Trade Center offices on September 11, 2001. Ann told the CEo that in order to fix it, she had to know what these people were feeling--they had to be able to talk openly about their grief. The CEO wanted absolutely no discussion of fear or grieving. Coombs says it was a six-figure contract. She turned it down because she felt employees were not being treated as they should be treated.
* What would you do? Sell someone something you feel they do not need or refuse to make the sale? That is what salepeople face in their jobs. Oh, a few months later Ann Coombs was contracted to work with the Bush administration to help government department deal with the post-September 11,2001, world. She took that job!

### The Golden Rule of Personal Selling
* When asked, "What would you like to learn in this course?" Steven Osborne, a student in my personal selling class, said, "I would like to know how to believe in a profession that many people do not trust." I sincerely hope you will be a believer in the value of sales integrity at the end of this sales course and be able to give Steven a positive perspective.
* Part of your answer will involve your understanding the definition of personal selling discussed earlier and the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. A rule is a prescribed guide for conduct or action. The **Golden Rule of Personal Selling** refers to the sales philosophy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated. Reciprocity is not expected. Read the short essay at the back of this chapter in the Appendix titled "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson". This short story illustrates the importance of helping people through our jobs and our lives.
* Exhibit 2.7 in Chapter 2 provides examples of how people around the world view the Golden Rule. As you study the vaiours statements of the Golden Rule in Exhibit 2.7, be sure to note that all are phrased negatively except one--the last one. The negative form would teach behavior in this way: If you do not like to get cheated in a purchase, don't cheat others. The positive form, on the other hand, would say that if you like to receive the best price, then offer the best price to your customers.
* To help you understand the concept better, consider how the Golden Rule applies to a litter of kittens. one child watched in delight as the tiny kittens snuggled together, in the cardboard box where hercat had just delivered the litter. "Aw, isn't that cute?" She exclaimed. "They love each other so much that they're trying to keep each other warm." "Well not exactly", relied her mother. "Actually they're trying to keep themselves warm". The Golden Rule is all about trying to keep somebody else warm, even if it means that we get cold in the process. Stop a minute and think about how this applies to your life and the business world. This important concept will be applied to personal selling throughout the textbook. It is especially effective in explaining differences in salespeople and why so many people may have a negative view of some salespeople and a positive view of other salespeople.

### Salesperson Difference
* Garry Smith, a former consumer goods sales manager, and your author illustrate some of the differences between salespeople's approaches to personal selling today. In general, Exhibit 1.3 shows that differences can be explained by the extent of the person's self-interest. As Gallup's survey poll of Americans indicates, people view traditional salespeople as having their self-interest as a priority. This type of salesperson is preoccupited with his or her well-being--usually defined in terms of making money--and thus is selfish and can not be trusted.
* The salesperson following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. However, places the interests of others before self-interest. Professional salespeople fall somewhere in between the traditional and Golden Rule salesperson in terms of how they view prospects and customers. As Exhibit 1.3 illustrates, as interest in serving others improves, a person's self-interest lessens. The more the salesperson considers the customer's interest, the better customer service.

```
Exhibit 1.3: Interest in serving the customer improves as our self-interst decreases

1. Traditional Salespeople
    * Do what they think they can get away with
    * Guided by self-interests
    * Attribute results to personal efforts
    * Seek recognition for efforts; sharing not important. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is life's main motivator

2. Professional Salespeople
    * Do what they are legally required to do.
    * Take care of customers
    * Attribute results to personal efforts, employer, customers, economy
    * Enjoy recognition, may share if it suits their purpose. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is important, but not to the customer's detriment

3. Golden Rule Salespeople
    * Do the right thing
    * Find others' interests most important
    * Attribute results to others.
    * Feel that an individual's performance is due to others, thus not motived by pride and ego.
    * Service most important, money is to be shared.


```

### Everybody Sells
* If you think about it, everyone sells. From an early age, you develop communication techniques for trying to get your way in life. You are involved in selling when you want someone to do something. For example, if you want to get a date, ask for a pay increase, return merchandise, urge your professor to raise your grade, or apply for a new job, you are selling. You use personal communication skills to persuade someone to act. Your ability to communicate effectively is a key to success in life.
* This is why so many people take sales courses. They want to improve their communication skills to be more successful in both their personal and business lives. The skills and knowledge gained from a selling course can be used by a student who plans to go into virtually any field, such as law, medicine, journalism, the military, or his or her own business.
* Selling is not just for salespeople; it is a must for everyone. In today's competitive environment, where good interpersonal skills are so valued, the lack of selling capability can put anyone at a disadvantage. So as you reat this book and progress through the course, think about how you can use the material both personally and in business.

### What Salespeople are Paid to Do
* In the short term, on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, salespeople are paid to sell--that is their job. When a sales manager sees one of her salespeople, the question is always, "Did you sell anything today?" Salespeople need to sell something "today" to meet the performance goals for:

        * Themselves, in order to serve others, earn a living, and keep their job
        * Their employer, because without the generation of revenues the company fails and thus can not serve others.
        * Their customers, because their products help customers fulfill their needs and help their organization grow.

* In the long run--month to month, year to year--salespeople must build positive long-term relationships with their customers. Why? Because they know, and now you know, that up to 80 percent or more of the future sales of many organizations come from present customers and customer referrals.
* salespeople need to close sales and at the same time maintain a great relationship with the buyer. Think about that last sentence. It is a very important thing to understand and learn. Salespeople want to sell to their present customers today, more tomorrow, and even more the day after that. How do you sell someone something and remain his or her business friend? You need to know how the Golden Rule of Personal Selling applies to the sales job. That is what this textbook is about.

### Why Choose a Sales Career
* Six major reasons for choosing a sales career are 1) service to others; 2) the wide variety of sales jobs available, 3) the freedom of being on your own; 4) the challenge of selling; 5) opportunity for advancement in a company; and 6) the rewards from a sales career

### Service: Helping Others
* When asked what she will look for in a career after graduating from college, a student of your author's, Jackie Pastrano, said, "I'd like to do sommething that helps other people." The sales career provides the opportunity for service and an emotional purpose in life gained from helping others. That is why this book's central core value is "service". Service is a major reason for choosing a sales career. For many, service is the number one reason.
* Service refers to making a contribution to the welfare of others. All of us want to do what Jackie hopes to do--help others! Would you like to help others? There are million of sales jobs and thus many opportunities to help people and organizations.

### A Variety of Sales Job Are Available
* As members of a firm's sales force, salespeople are a vital element in the firm's effort to market goods and services profitably. Personal selling accounts for major expenditures by most companies and presents a large number of career opportunities. There are millions of sales jobs, and the probability that at one time during your life you will have a sales job is high.
* There are also hundreds, maybe thousands, of different types of sales positions. Think about this! Almost every good and service you know of has a salesperson who sells it to one or more people in order to get the product to the final user. That is why so many sales jobs are available.

### Types of Sales jobs--Which is for You?
* Although there are numerous specific types of sales jobs, most salespeople work in one of three categories: as a retail salesperson, a wholesale salesperson, or a manufacturer's sales representative. These categories are classified according to the type of products sold and the salesperson's type of employer.

### Selling in Retail
* A retail salesperson sells goods or services to consumers for their personal, nonbusiness use. Retail selling is so important to a society that this book has numerous examples of it. Three common types of sellers who sell at retail are the 1) in-store salesperson, 2) direct seller who sells face-to-face away from a fixed store location, and 3) telephone salesperson.
* Look back at the definition of a retail salesperson. Think of all the different types of retail organizations selling something--retails such as bakeries, banks, caters, hotels, video stores, and travel agents, and stores selling clothes, electronics, flowers, food, and furniture. Each customer contact person takes your money and provides a good or service in return. Customer contact person is another name for a salesperson. **Although the title may be different, the job is the same--to help you buy.**
* **Direct sellers** sell face-to-face to consumers--typically in their homes--who use the products for their person use. An organization could have one salesperson or 3 million salespeople, like Amway.
* As in any type of job--including accountants, mechanics, and politicians--some retail salespeople do very little to help their customers. However, many retail salespeople are highly skilled professionals, commanding exceptionally high incomes fro their ability to service their customers. I personally know retail salespeople earning 40,000 a year selling shoes; 80,000 selling furniture, 110,000 selling jewelry, and 150,000 selling automobiles.

### Selling for a Wholesaler
* Wholesaler (also called distributors) buy products from manufacturers and other wholesalers and sell to other organizations. A wholesale salesperson sells product to parties for:

        * Resale, such as groccery retailers buying items and selling to consumers
        * use in producing other goods or services, such as a home builder buying electrical and plumbing supplies
        * Operating an organization, such as your school buying supplies

* Firms engaged in wholesaling are called wholesaling middlemen. Classifying wholsaling middlemen is difficult because they vary greatly in 1) the products they sell, 2) the markets to which they sell, and 3) their methods of operation. As there are so many different types, the discussion of types of wholesalers is beyond the scope of this book.

### Selling for a Manufacturer
* Manufacturers' salespeople work for organizations producing the product. The types of **manufacturer's sales representative** positions range from people who deliver milk and bread to the specialized salesperson selling highly technical industrial products. The salesperson working for a manufacturer may sell to other manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, or directly to consumers. There are five main types of manufacturer sales positions:

        1. An account representative calls on a large number of already establish customers in, for example, the food, textile, and apparel industries. This person asks for the order.
        2. A detail salesperson concentrates on performing promotional activities and introducing new products rather than directly soliciting orders. The medical detail salesperson seeks to persuade doctors, the indirect customers, to specify a pharmaceutical company's trade name product for prescriptions. The actual sales is ultimately made through a wholesaler or directly to pharmacists and hospitals that fill prescriptions.
        3. A sales engineer sells products that call for technical know-how and an ability to discuss technical aspects of the product. Expertise in identifying, analyzing, and solving customer problem is another critical factor. This type of selling is common in the oil, chemical, machinery, and heavy equipment industries because of the t echnical nature of their products.

        Greg Munoz, a sales engineer for the Dow Chemical Company, says,

        Our sales technique typically takes the team approach. Several of Dow's finest staff (technical, production, marketing, and support) and I work in unison to address the customer's specific needs. I am responsible for building the business relationship with the customer and directing resources and information toward securing a customer's plastic-resin business. Market managers and district sales managers coordinate pricing and positioning as the customer relates to the industry as a whole. Dow technicians engineer materials to meet or exceed the requirements specified for the application and work with the customer's production department to see that they perform accordingly. Customer service representatives handle order placement and product-delivery logistics while servicing the customer's information needs. Once the sale is closed, I follow up and maintain our profile while serving as the first line of communication and interface for the customer

        4. An industrial products salesperson, nontechnical, sells a tangible product to industrial buyers. No high degree of technical knowledge is required. Packaging materials manufacturers and office equipment sales representatives are nontechnical salespeople.

        5. A service salesperson, unlike the four preceding types of manufacturing salespeople, must sell the benefits of intangible or nonphysical products such as financial, advertising, or computer repair services. Services, like goods, are either technical or nontechnical in nature.

* Selling services is ordinarily more difficult than selling tangibles. The salesperson can show, demonstrate, and dramatize tangible products; the salesperson of intangible product can not. Intangibles often are difficult for the prospect to comprehend. People can not feel, smell, see, hear, or taste intangible products. This makes them more challenging to sell.

### Order-Takers versus Order-Getters
* Sales jobs vary widely in their nature and requipments. Some sales jobs require the salesperson only to take orders. **Order-takers** may ask what the customer wants or wait for the customer to order. They do not have a sales strategy and often use no sales presentation. Order-takers must be employed to bring in additional business that the employer probably would not obtain without their efforts. many never attempt to close the sale. They perform useful service. However, few truly create sales.
* On the other hand, the creative selling of tangible goods or intangible services in highly competitive lines (or where the product has no special advantage) moves merchandise that can not be sole in equal volume without a salesperson. These people are **order-getters**. They get new and repeat business using a creative sales strategy and a well-executed sales presentation. The salesperson has an infinitely more difficult selling situation than that faced by the order-taker. In this sense, the individual is a true salesperson, which is why this person usually earns so much more than the order-taker.
* **This salesperson has two selling challenges. First, the salesperson must often create discontent with what the prospect already has before beginning to sell constructively. Second, the salesperson often has overcome the most powerful and obstinate resistance. For example, the prospect may never have heard of the product and, at the outset, may have no desire whatsoever to purchase it. The prospect may even be prejudiced against it and may resent the intrusion of this stranger. In other instances, the prospect may want it but may want competing products more. Frequently, the prosepct can not afford it. To meet such sales situations successfully requires creative selling of the highest order.**
* Creative salespeople often are faced with selling to numerous people to get one order. This is the most difficult selling situation beccause the representative **may have to win over not only the decision maker, the one who can say yes, but also other persons who can not approve the order but who have the power to veto.**

### Freedom of Action: You're on Your Own
* A second reason why people choose a sales career is the freedom it offers. A sales job provides possibly the greative relative freedom of any career. Experienced employees in outside sales usually receive little direct supervision and may go for days, even weeks, without seeing their bosses.
* Job duties and sales goals are explained by a manager. Salespeople are expected to carry out their job duties and achieve goals with minimum guidance. They usually leave home to contact customers around the corner or around the world.

### Job Challenge is Always There
* Working alone with the responsibility of a territory capable of generating thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars in revenue for your company is a personal challenge. This environment adds great variety to a sales job. Salespeople often deal with hundreds of different people and firms over time. it is much like operating your own business, without the burdens of true ownership.

### Opportunities for Advance are Great
* Successful salespeople have many opportunities to move into top management positions. in many instances, this advancement comes quickly.
* A sales personnel career path, as Exhibit 1.7 depicts, is the upward sequence of job movements during a sales career. Occasionally, people without previous sales experience are promoted into sales management positions. However, 99 percent of the time, a career in sales management begins with an entry-level sales position. Firms believe that an experienced sales professional has the credibility, knowledge, and background to assume a higher position in the company.
* Most companies have two or three successive levels of sales positions, beginning at the junior or trainee level. Beginning as a salesperson allowes a person to:

        * Learn about the attitudes and activities of the company's salespeople
        * Become familiar with customer attitude toward the company, its products, and its salespeople.
        * Gain firsthand knowledge of products and their application, which is most important in technical sales.
        * Become seasoned in the business world

```
Exhibit 1.7: A sales personnel career path
sales trainee->salesperson->key account salesperson->District sales manager->Regional sales manager->Divisional sales manager->National sales manager->Vice president of marketing->President

```

* When asked why they like their jobs, first line sales managers say it is because of the rewards. By rewards, they mean both financial rewards and nonfinancial rewards, such as the great challenge and the feeling of making a valuable contribution to their salespeople and the company. Managers also frequently mention that this position represents their first major step toward the top. They have made the cut and are on the management team. Instead of having responsibility for 1 million in sales, as a salesperson does, the manager is responsible for 10 million.
* With success, various jobs throughout the sales force and in the corporate marketing department open up.  This can include sales training, sales analysis, advertising, and product management. Frequently, traveling the upward career path involves numerous moves from field sales to corporate sales, back to the field, then to corporate, back to the field, and so on. However, sales experience prepares people for more responsible jobs in the company.
* Success also creates financial rewards. The larger a company's revenues, the heavier the responsibility of the chief executive, and teh large the compensation. Today, it's common for a CEO of a large national corporation to receive compensation totaling more than 1 million annually.
* Leaving aside compensation at the top echelons, both corporate and field sales managers typically receive higher salaries than others (such as production, advertising, product, or personnel managers) at the same organizational level. Salary extended vacation and holiday periods; pension programs; health, accident, and legal insurance programs; automobiles and auto expenses; payment of professional association dues; educational assistance for themselves and sometimes for their families; financial planning assistance; company airplanes; home and entertainment expenses; and free country club membership. The higher the sales position, the greater the benefits offered. In addition to performance, salary typically is related to the following factors:

        * Annual sales volume of units managed.
        * Number of salespeople managed
        * Length of experience in sales
        * Annual sales volume of the firm

### Rewards: The Sky's the Limit
* As a salesperson, you can look forward to two types of rewards--nonfinancial and financial.

##### Nonfinancial Rewards
* Sometimes called psychological income or intrinsic rewards, nonfinancial rewards are generated by the individual, not given by the company. You know the job has been done well--for instance, when you have helped the buyer through the purchase of your product.
* Successfully meeting the challenges of the job produces a feeling of self-worth. You realize your job is important. Everyone wants to feel good about their job, and a selling career allows you to experience these good feelings and intrinsic rewards daily. Salespeople often report that the nonfinancial rewards of their jobs are just as important to them as financial rewards.
* After training, a salesperson is often given responsibility for a sales territory. The person then moves into a regular sales position. In a short time, the salesperson can earn the status and financial rewards of a senior sales position by contacting the larger, more important customers. Some companies refer to this function as a key account sales position.

### There are Two Career Paths
* Don't let Exhibit 1.7 mislead you--many salespeople prefer selling over managing people. They want to take care of themselves rather than others. In some companies, a salesperson may earn more money than even the manager, even the firm's president.
* Many companies recognize the value of keeping some salespeople in the field for their entire sales career. They do a good job, know their customers, and love what they are doing--so why promote them if they do not want to move up within the organization? However, many other people work hard to move into management.

### You Can Move Quickly into Management
* The first managerial level is usually the district sales manager's position. It is common for people to be promoted to this position within two or three years after joining the company. From district sales manager, a person may move into higher level of sales management.

### Financial Rewards
* Many are attracted to selling because in a sales career financial rewards are commonly based solely on performance. Many professional salespeople have opportunities to earn large salaries. Their salaries average even higher than salaries for other types of workers at the same organizational level.

### Is a Sales Career Right for You?
* It may be too early in life to determine if you really want to be a salesperson. The balance of this book will aid you in investigating sales as a career. Your search for any career begins with you. In considering a sales career, be honest and realistic. Ask your questions such as these:

        * What are my past accomplishments
        * What are my future goals
        * Do I want to have the responsibility of a sales job
        * Do I mind travel? How much travel is acceptable
        * How much freedom do I want in the job?
        * Do I have the personality characteristics for the job
        * Am I willing to transfer to another city? Another state?

Your answers to these questions can help you analyze the various types of sales jobs and establish criteria for evaluating job openings. Determine the industries, types of products or services, and specific companies in which you have an interest.
* College placement offices, libraries, and business periodicals offer a wealth of information on companies as well as sales positions in them. Conversations with friends and acquaintances who are involved within selling, or have been in sales, can give you realistic insight into what challenges, rewards, and disadvantages the sales vocation offers. To better prepare yourself to obtain a sales job, you must understand what companies look for in salespeople

### A Sales Manager's View of the Recruit
* The following discussion of what sales maanger consider when hiring a salesperson is based on a summary of a talk given by a sales manager to a sales class. It is reasonably representative of what companies look for when hiring salespeople

        We look for outstanding applicants who are mature and intelligent. They should be able to handle themselves well in the interview, demonstrating good interpersonal skills. They should have a well-thought-out career plan and be able to discuss it rationally. They should have a friendly, pleasing personality. A clean, neat appeanrance is a must. They should have a positive attitude, be willing to work hard, be ambitious, and demonstrate a good degree of interest in the employer's business field. They should have good grades and other personal, school, and business accomplishments. Finally, they should have clear goals and objectives in life. The more common characteristics on which applicants for our company are judged are 1) appearnace, 2) self-expression, 3) maturity, 4) personality, 5) experience, 6) enthusiasm, and 7) interest in the job

* People often consider sales career because they have heard that salespeople can earn good salaries. They think anyone can sell. T hese people have not considered all the facts. A sales job has high rewards because it also has many important responsibilities. Companies do not pay high salaries for nothing. As you will see in this book, a sales career involves great challenges that require hard work by qualified individuals. Let us review the characteristics of a successful salesperson.

### Success in Selling--What does it Take?
* Over the years, I have asked many salespeople and sales managers the question, "What helps make a salesperson successful?" The answer is contained in the words love, success, and person, as in the phrase "a person who loves success." As these words will indicate, to be a good salesperson today it helps to be a good person.
* As a student, I love phrases and acronyms to help me remember. That is why I use them here to help you remember and better understand what selling in today's business environment requires. As Exhibit 1.8 shows, the eight most frequently mentioned characteristics necessary to be successful in sales can be found in the words love and success. To help remember, think of the word ssuccess, spelled with four s's.

```

* Stamina for the job
* Use of Golden Rule
* Communication Ability
* Personal Characteristics

* Sales Knowledge

MAKING THE SALE

Don't Quit

        When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
        when the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
        When the funds are low and teh debts are high, 
        And you want to smile but you have to sigh,
        When care is pressing you down a bit--
        Rest if you must but don't you quit
        Life is queer with its twists and turns,
        As every one of us sometimes learns
        And many a person turns about
        When they might have won had they stuck it out
        Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
        You may succeed with another blow.
        Often the struggler has given up
        When he might have captured the victor's cup;
        And he learned too late
        When the night came down
        How close he was to the golden crown.
        Success is failure turned inside out--
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
        It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.

```

* **S--Success Begins with Love** The successful salesperson is an individual who loves selling, finds it exciting, and is strongly convinced that the product being sold offers something of great value. Of the eight work characteristics for sales success, love of selling is clearly number one. Love is at the center of success. It has been said that if you find a job you love, you will never work again

* **S--Service to Others** Today's salespeople make a contribution to the welfare of others through service. They are dream makers. They sell solutions to people's needs that make their dreams come true. Salespeople love to help others fulfill their needs through selling their products.

* **U--Use the Golden Rule of Selling** If salespeople do not know how to place the customer's needs first, how can they build a long-term relationship? People like to buy, not be sold. And they like to buy from people they know and trust. That is one reason today's salesperson needs to treat others as he or she would like to be treated.

* **C-Communication Ability** Good salespeople are good communicators. Great salespeople are great communicators. Whether it involves nonverbal or verbal communications, as discussed in Chapter 4, top salespeople speak the other person's language.

* **Characteristics for the Job** Can anyone be a successful salesperson? It helps to reach that goal if you possess the personal characteristics needed for a sales career. These characteristics are discussed after the remaining work characteristics are introduced. Let's continue our discussion of those work characteristics now.

* **E-Excels at Strategic Thinking** The sixth work characteristic is that high-performing salespeople tend to be strategic problem solvers for their customers. They can match their product's benefits with the customer's needs. Strategic customer sales planning is discussed more in Chapter 7.

* **S-Sales Knowledge at the M.D Level** Top professional salespeople have mastered the basic competencies of selling, which include product knowledge (see Chapter 5) and selling skills. As goods and services become more complex, companies place greater emphasis on training their salespeople and on salespeople training themselves. Salespeople must be experts on everything involved with their products, as a medical doctor is an expert. Remember, however, that knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch.

* **S-Stamina for the Challenge** Today's salesperson needs to be physically, mentally, and spiritually prepared to meet the daily challenges of a sales career. Body, mind, and soul play an important role in the level of a person's stamina. With physical preparedness comes mental strength. Exercise, for example, elevates your mood by increasing energy and simultaneously secreting adrenaline-like substances in the body that act as stimulants and antidepressants, according to the medical community. The increased feeling of well-being transmits itself to the body and mind. In this stressed-out world we all need stress relief. Exercise can help!
* Kenneth H. Cooper, MD, often referred to as the Fater of Aerobic, says, "it is easier to maintain good health through proper exercise, diet, and emotional balance than to regain it once is lost." Aerobic, strength training, and stretching are wonderful tool to reduce stress, help you feel better, focus better, and have more energy. If you are not actively using these techniques, try them for three months. Find out how exercise can help you! Be sure to check with you doctor before starting any exercise problem, though.
* For many people, personal spirituality or belief in a Supreme Being has a great impact upon physical and mental stamina and thus job performance. This is especially true if they feel their sales career is a calling. People's faith may direct everything they do on the job, ranging from how they treat customers to how ethically they act toward their employer.

* **C-Characteristics for the Job Examined** We skipped over the personal characteristics needed for a sales career earlier. Let's discuss them now. Certainly any discussion of what it takes to be successful in a sales job has to include the person's personal characteristics. As we have described selling, the salesperson wants to help people and thus build a long-term relationship. The question has been asked "How do you sell someone something and remain business friends?"
* In the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, his teacher tells Harry that it is not our ability that show who we truly are but our choices. A salesperson can choose to be like the traditional salesperson we all disparage or the salesperson who is truly people oriented.

* **Caring, Job, Harmony** The most important characteristic of a ssuccessful salesperson is a **caring** attitude--caring about the customer's best interest. Many Golden Rule salespeople mean "love" when they say caring. The two terms are interchangeable. They love, and thus care about, everything connected with their work and life. Without caring, it's difficult--if not impossible--to possess the other eight characteristics of a Golden Rule saesperson.
* There is great **joy** in truly caring for one's customers, and this job motivates a salesperson to care for customers continuously. Because the salesperson is concerned with what is best for the customer, there ise a sense of peace or **harmony** in the relationship. The custoemr can trust the salesperson, so all fear of being taken advantage of is removed.

* **Patience, Kindness, Moral Ethics** Salespeople are often under pressure to make the sales today! They need to be able to handle the pressure to sell now using **patience** in their working relationship with the customer. Let the customer decide when to buy instead of pressuring for a quick decision. A buyer needs information to make an educated decision. Often this takes time and great patience. Patience in closing the sale goes a long way toward building a long-term relationship. Buyers do not like to be pressured into making a quick decision. Do you? Neither do I! People like to buy, not be sold.
* Your actions speak louder than your words. People want to see you "walk the talk, not talk the talk." Having patience shows that the salesperson understands the customer's needs and wants to help. This is a display of **kindness**, a kind person is patient and compassionate. Salespeople must be kind to their customers in order to show that they aren't interested solely in making the sale. Remember, we are interested in following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--acting in the best interest of others, not just making sales. A salesperson who follow the Golden Rule is **morally ethical** individual whom the customer can trust.

* **Faithful, Fair, Self-Control** A salesperson who cares, likes the job, is good to work with, and is patient, kind, and morally ethical is certainly someone who will be **faithful** in taking care of customers. The salesperson will spend the time necessary to help, not just make the sale and never be heard from again until the next sales call. We all want to be thought of as ethical. Faithfulness is an ethical virtue. It shows the employer, customers, and competitors that the salesperson is **fair** to all. Customers can trust this salesperson.

* **Self-Control is Most Difficult** Now we come to **self-control**, which is the most difficult trait for a salesperson to develop. This is why we discuss it last. Self-control involves restraining our emotions, passions, and desires usually for self-gain. How do salespeople control themsevles by being patient in closing the sale, for example? Remember, the salesperson must sell to make a living and keep the job. Thus, there is considerable incentive for the salesperson to use pressure or lie, for example, to compel the customer to buy something that may not be needed or that is falsely represented.

* **Self-Control Involves Discipline** Self-control also refers to the needed discipline to rise early, work late, and prepare for the next day in the evening. Often the biggest challenge to success is not out there in the sales territory; it is within us. We can not achieve unless we are willing to pay the price--discipline.
* Discipline also includes creating time for family--parents, spouse, and children. So often we caught up in the American way of wanting to be rich and famous that we forgot about the others in our life. Instead we must discipline ourselves to set priorities. What comes first, your job or your family? For me, it should always be family before job. Setting priorities requires willpower many of us do not have. Do you ever wonder why t here are so many divorces in America and so many children raised in one-parent homes? Misplacing priorities by not putting family first is the number one contributor to the breakdown of American families. Self-control and discipline are thus very important personal characteristics for all of us, no matter what our careers.
