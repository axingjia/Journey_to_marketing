# PREFACE

### Welcome to Relationship Selling through Service
* Obtaining new customers and retaining present ones are the main challenges of salespeople. Increase in sales and profits is up to the sales personnel--the people who represent their employers through interacting with present or prospective customers. Sales professionals strive to create a long-term business relationship, which implies that personal relationships with clients are formed. Consumers want to buy from someone who cares about their needs. People do business with the people they trust, and they trust the people they know.
* A megatrend in today's business world involves going to extreme effort to meet consumer needs. Organizations can not afford to lose customers. It is always easier to sell to a satisfied customer than an unsatisfied one. The cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than keeping a present customer.
* The textbook focuses on taking care of the customer through exceptional customer service. **Service means making a contribution to the welfare of others. Salespeople exist to help others.**

### New Additions, Expansions, and Reexamination to this Edition
* Using this textbook each year in my sales classes has resulted in a constant study of the text by students who provide feedback on its content. Present users of the textbook have offered detailed critiques providing direction for revision of the book, as have the reviewers noted in the Acknowledgements. For this edition, I carefully reread the book to ensure that the text better reflects my thoughts and ideas on the subject. The relationships and interactions in the various steps of the selling process have been carefully examined to form a more seamless flow from one chapter to the next, and special emphasis is placed on the importance of ethical behavior in working with prospects and customers.
* ABC's of Selling trains readers on a specific, yet generic, step-by-step selling process that is universal in nature. Once learned, a student has the basic background to sell any product. Arguably, no other personal selling textbook presents a sales process or system in a logical sequence: from planning and the approach, to closing and follow-up for exceptional customer service. Scores of sales personnel in thee industry today comment on how this textbook reflects what they do on sales calls with prospects and customers. The goal of ABC's of Selling has always been to demonstrate to students the order of steps within the selling process; provide numerous examples of what should be in each step; and explain how the steps within the selling process interact with one another. If students understand the sales system by the end of the course, the class has successfully contribute to their eduction.

### Examples of New Additions
* ABC's of Selling is a market leader in sales classes worldwide, and its materials can be found in four international versions. Numerous sales trainers around the globe use our selling process to prepare their salespeople.

### The Uniqueness of ABC's of Selling
8 The appendix to Chapter 1, "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson," reveals this textbook's unique central focus--serving others unselfishly. To aid in this message, the acclaimed worldwide Golden Rule was incorporated in order to stress treating others as you would like to be treated in the marketplace and workplace.
* The textbook's foundation is based upon service. **Its cornerstone is love (caring) of others.** ABC's of Selling's values are supported by the pillars of an organization's--and individual's--integrity, trustworthiness, and character. The center of business and personal life revoles around personal interactions; as a result, a theme of this textbook is that ethical service, based upon truth between people, build strong long-term relationships.
* ABC's of Selling seeks to prepare people for the 21st century's demand for moral and ethical treatment--a universal declaration for human rights. It is a calling for a higher standard than what previously exists in many organizations worldwide. The General Assembly of the United Unations has proclaimed that humans possess reason and conscience, and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood. **Organizations should not be engaged in war within the marketplace, but committed to serving humanmind.**
* Many people seem to separate their personal life from their business life. Some individuals, when entering the business world, tend to follow the example of others to generate sales. The use of this textbook in your classroom may provide some students with a final opportunity to discuss how to enter the rat race without becoming a rat.

### ABC's Approach
* ABC's of Selling was conceived as a method of providing ample materials that allow readers to construct their own sales presentations after studying the text. This allows the instructor the flexibility of focusing on the "how-to-sell" approach within the classroom. Covering the basic foundations for understanding the concepts and practices of selling in a practical, straightforward, and readable manner, it provides students with a guide to use in preparing sales presentations and role-playing exercises.

### The Philosophy behind This Book
* The title should help you understand the philosophy of this book. A student of sales should understand the fundamentals--the basics--of personal selling. All of them. I do not advocate one way of selling as the best route to success. There are many roads to reaching one's goals.
* I do feel a salesperson should have an assortment of selling skills and should be very knowledgeable, even an expert, in the field. Based on the situation, the salesperson determines the appropriate actions to take for a particular prospect or customer. No matter what the situation, however, the basic fundamentals of selling can be applied.
* There is no place in our society for high-pressure, manipulative selling. The salesperson is a problem solver, a helper, and an advisor to the customer. **If the customer has no need, the salesperson should accept that and move on to help another person or firm.** If the customer has a need, however, the salesperson should and must go for the sale. **All successful salespeople I know feel that once they determine that the customer is going to buy someone's product--and that their product will satisfy that customer's needs--it is their job to muster all their enter, skill, and know-hwo to make that sale. That is what it's all about!**
* It is my sincere hope that after the reader has studied this book, he or she will say, "There's a lot more to selling than I ever imagined." I hope many people will feel that this material can help them earn a living and that selling is a great occupation and career.
* At the end of the course, I hope all the students will have learned how to prepare and give a sales presentation by visually, verbally, and nonverbally communicating their message. I know of no other marketing course whose class project is so challenging and where so much learning takes place.
* Finally, I hope each student realizes that these new communication skills can be applied to all aspects of life. Once learned and internalized, selling skills will help a person be a better commnicator throughout life.

### Basic Organization of the Book
* The publisher and I work hard to ensure that ABC's of Selling would provide students with the basic foundation for understanding all major aspects of selling. The 14 chapters in the text are divided into four parts:

        * Selling as a profession. Emphasizes the history, career, rewards, and duties of the professional salesperson and illustrates the importance of the sales function to the organization's success. It also examines the social, ethical, and legal issues in selling.
        * Preparation for Relationship Selling. Presents the background information salespeople use to deveolop their sales presentations
        * The Relationship Selling Process. At the heart of this book, this part covers the entire selling process from prospecting to follow-up. State-of-the-art selling strategies, practices, and techniques are presented in a "how-to" fashion.
        * Time and Territory Management: Keys to Success. The importance of the proper use and management of one's time and sales territory is given through coverage.

### Special to This Edition
* Ethics Emphasized. Unselfish and ethical service to the customer underscores the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--a sales philosohpy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated without expecting reciprocity. This is how to build long-term relationships with customers.
* The Tree of Business Life Icon. Beginning with Chapter 1, The Tree of Business Life icon is used to remind the reader of one the main themes of the book. This theme emphasizes that by providing ethical service you build true relationships. This section was developed in hopes of having the reader consider how a salesperson would incorporate ethical service into the chpater's topic.
* The Golden Rule Icon. The Golden Rule icon appears in each chapter to help reinforce the Tree of Business Life. The combination of the Golden Rule and the "Tree" guidelines for business and selling forms the core theme of this textbook. Unselfishly treating prosepcts/customers as you would like to be treated without expecting something in return results in ethical service that builds true long-term relationships. If you think about it, this is how you build true personal friends. Why not build your business relationships on this rock?
* Video cases. Cases 2.1, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5A, 7.3, 10.3, 12.4, 13.3 can be used independently or with eight of the videos accompanying this book. Each of the eight cases highlights a tough ethical dilemma often faced by sales personnel in today's competitive marketplace. use any of all of these cases to emphasize ethics in your sales class.
* Sales Call Role-Plays and ProSelling Videos. The first three of the four role-plays in Appendix A at the back of this book have videos created incorporating our selling process. The two people featured in the three role-plays completed my selling course. The professional selling materials in Chapter 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 do a great job in illustrating. Actually usedf in my classes by hundreds of students, these role-plays are created from information used by today's top sales forces.
* Sell Yourself on a Job Interview. The all-time favorite role-play is in Appendix B with other expierential exercises. For years I have used this student pleaser in both my personal selling and sales management classes. When students see themselves on video, they quickly realize what needs to be done for a professional interview. You have to try this exercise one time.
* Student Application Learning Exercises (SALES). Chapters directly related to creating the role-play have SALES that aid students in better understanding how to construct this popular class project. These were first used in my classes in the fall of 1997. Students unaimously felt they were great in helping them correctly construct their role-plays. SALES appear at the end of Chapters 3, 5A, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
* Sales Careers. Career information has been expanded throughout so students will better understand that there are sales jobs in all organizations--business, service, and nonprofit
* Selling Experiential Exercises. These end-of-chapter exercises help students better understand themselves and/or the text material. Many can be done in class or completed outside and discussed in class.
* Selling Globally Appendix. Many of these were writen by friends and colleagues from countries around the world. They are at the back of the book.
* Technology in Selling. A central theme within each chapter shows the use of technology and automation in selling and servicing prospects and customers.

FACING A SALES CHALLEGE
* Debra Hutchins majored in French, with a minor in English literature, at Washiongton University in St. Louis. After graduation she began working as a secretary in the marketing department at Sunwest Bank in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
* "I had never considered a sales job while in school, and sales didn't appeal to me when I began work at the bank. I always felt you would have to be an extrovert. I'm more the shy, intellectual type. I don't see myselfin the role of a salesperson.
* "Someday I do want a more challenging job. I'm a very hard worker, long hours don't bother me. I've always had a need to achieve success. One of the things I like about being a secretary is helping customers when they call the bank. It is important tocarefully listen to their problems or what they want in order to provide good customer service. Maybe one day I'll find a job that has more challenge, professionalism, and reward."
* If youwere in Debra's position, what would you do? What types of jobs would you recommend she consider?

```

* Debra Hutchins is like many people in that while she was in school a career in sales did not seem like the thing to do. Most people are unfamiliar with what salespeople do.
* As you learn more about the world of sales, a career selling goods or services may become appealing. The salesperson makes valuable contribution to our quality of life by selling goods and services that benefit individual and industry. Red Motley, former editor of Parade magazine, once said, "Nothing happens until somebody sells something." Selling brings in the money and causes cash registers across the country to ring. For centuries, the salespeople of the world have caused goods and services to change hands.
* More than ever, today's salespeople are a dynamic power in the business world. They generate more revenue in the U.S. economy than workers in any other profession. The efforts of salespeople have a direct impact on such diverse areas as these:

        * Ensuring the success of new products
        * Keeping existing products on the retailer's shelf
        * Constructing manufacturing facilities
        * Opening businesses and keeping them open
        * Generating sales orders that result in the loading of trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, andpipelines that carry goods to customer all over the world.

* The salesperson is engaged in a highly honorable, challenging, rewarding, and professional career. In this chapter, you are introduced to the career, rewards, and duties of the salesperson. The chapter begins by reltaing an organization's business purpose to its marketing efforts.

## What is the Purpose of Business?
* **The purpose of business is to increase the general well-being of humandkind through the sales of goods and services.** This requires making a profit in order to operate the business and provide beneficial products to the marketplace. Profit is a means to an end. Reduced t obasics, businesses have two major functions: production of goods or creation of services and marketing those goods and services.

## The Primary Goal of Business
* The primary goal of business should be to transform the marketplace and workplace into an environment where everyone is  treated as they would like to be treated. Business should be fair to all parties involved in both the buying and selling of goods and services.

## Marketing's Definition
* There are numerous definition of marketing. Your book will use the American Marketing Association's definition:

        Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders.

* The **marketing concept** is a business philosophy that says the customers' want-satisfaction is the economic and social jkustification for a firm's existence. Consequently, all company activities should be devoted to determining customers' wants and then satisfying them, while still making a profit.


## Essentials of a Firm's Marketing Effort
* The essentials of a firm's marketing effort include its ability 1) to determine the needs of its customers and 2) to create and maintain an effective marketing mix that satisfy customer needs. As shown in Exhibit 1.1, **a firm's marketing mix consists of four main elements--product, price, distribution or place, and promotion**--a marketing manager uses to market goods and services. It is the marketing manager's responsibility to determine how best to use each element in the firm's marketing efforts.

## Product: It's More than You Think
* A **good** is a physical object that can be purchased. A radio, a house, and a car are examples of a good. A **service** is an action or activity done for others for a fee. Lawyers, plumbers, teachers, and taxicab drivers perform services. **The term product refers to both goods and services**.
* So, what is a product? When you think of a product, most likely you imagine some tangible object you can touch, such as a radio or automobile. However, there is more to a product than you think.
* A **product** is a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes, including packagin, color, and brand, plus the services and even the reputation of the seller. People buy more than a set of physical attributes. They buy want-satisfaction such as what the product will do, its quality, and the image of owning the product.

## Price: It's Important to Success
* The corporate marketing department also determines each product's initial price. This process involves establishing each product's normal price and possible special discount prices. Since product price often is critical to customers, it is important part of the marketing mix. **Price** refers to the value of worth of a product that attracts the buyer to exchange money or something of value for the product.

```

    * Trade shows

```

## Distribution: It has to be Available
* The marketing manager also determines the best method of distributing the product. Distribution refers to the channel structure used to transfer products from an organization to its customers. It is important to have the product available to custoemrs in a convenient and accessible location when they want it.

## Promotion: You have to Tell People about it
* Promotion, as part of the marketing mix, increases company sales by communicating product information to potential custoemrs. The four basic parts of a firm's promotional effort are 1) personal selling, 2) advertising, 3) public relations, and 4) sales promotion. Example of each marketing mix ingredient are shown in Exhibit 1.2. The company's sales force is one segment of the firm's promotional effort. Salespeople are part of the organization's sales force. So what is the job of the salesperson?

## What is Selling
* Many people consider selling and marketing synonymous terms. However, selling is actually only one of the many marketing components. In business, a traditional definition of personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to persuade a prospective customer to buy something--a good, service, idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.
* This definition of selling involves a person helping another person. The salesperson often works with prospects or customers to examine their needs, provide information, suggest a product to meet their needs, and provide after-the-sale service to ensure long-term satisfaction.
* The definition also involves communications between seller and buyer. **The salesperson and the buyer discuss needs and talk about the product relative to how it will satisfy the person's needs. If the product is what the person needs, then the salesperson attempts to persuade the prospect to buy it.
* Unfortunately this explanation of personal selling does not explain the best selling philosohpy for the 21st century. Why?

## Personal Selling Today
* In the early 2000s the worst side of American business became obvious. Corporate corruption, misstated financials, and the personal profit of chief executives as their companies went out of business all contributed to the public's negative attitude toward most, if not all, business professions. Unethical business practices resulted in bankruptcies, which in turn led to massive layoffs across the country. This had an impact on all Americans and their families, leaving no person or organization untouched.

## How Some Salespeople are Viewed
* Each year, from 1977 to 2001, Gallup (one of America's leading pollsters) has found that insurance salespeople, advertising practitioners, and used car salespeople are the three lowest-rated job categories on perceived honesty and ethical standards. Which of the three would you say rated the lowest each year? Yes, it was the used car salesperson! Unfortunately, people tend to generalize from such research findings that most salespeople are not honest or ethical, which is not the case. I know used car salespeople with the highest of ethical standards. Be careful in making a hasty decision about salesperson. You cannot judge a book by its cover. You may be dealing with a sheep in wolf's clothing.

## What about You?
* How do you view the honesty and ethical standards of today's businesses and salespeople? For the last several years, at the beginning of my classes, I have asked sales students the following three questions on a poll found on my website:

        1. What does the general public think about salespeople? Only 10 percent of the almost 2,000 respondents had a positive attitude
        2. What do you think about salespeople? Thirty-five percent had a positive attitude
        3. After graduation, would you accept a sales job? Forty-five percent said "yes".

* These percentage do not represent high marks from my students. What are your answers to these three questions?
* What would you say is the number one reason for salespeople's low ratings on honesty and ethics? It is trust. Many people feel they may not be able to trust a salesperson. Why? Greed is often the answer! The love of money is the root of all kinds of problems. From the least of us to the greatest, we all seem to be greedy to some extent, and greed can make some people blind to all else around them. Given all that has gone on in America as we are revising this textbook, we will use a different definition of selling in your book from the traditional view. This difference is very important given the present status of business in America and the public's--maybe even your--view of salespeople.

### A New Definition of Personal Selling
* The new deinition inserts the word unselfish into the traditional definition discussed earlier. it is that simple! **Personal selling refers to the personal communication of information to unselfishly persuade a prospective customer to buy somethin--a good, a service, an idea, or something else--that satisfies that individual's needs.**
* This definition of selling involves the many things we discussed before, such as a person helping another person through selling. However, when the word unselfishly is added to the definition, it makes a big difference in how someone might look at selling. The word unselfish tells salespeople to be caring toward customers and to serve--help--the person or organization without expecting to get something in return. If you are still wondering about the "unselfish" approach to selling, think of the analogy of selling to your grandmother.

### Think of Your Grandmother
* Think of your, or your best friend's, grandmother. Would you treat her in a selfish manner? Would you sell her something just to make a sale? No way! You would not take advantage of Granny. Salespeople should handle their customers with unselfish and ethical service. How are you going to build a long-term relationship with customers unless you treat them unselfishly by placing their interests first?
* **Tell the truth about what the product will do, give the best price on the best product for the need, deliver on time, and provide outstanding follow-up service to make sure the customer is delighted with the purchase. If it is not the right product for the need expressed, tell the customer. If she or he still wants to buy--sell it to the customer!** After all, you, the saleperson, may be wrong.
* Or would you walk away from the sale as Ann Coombs did with a prospect? The chief executive officer (CEO) of a multinational bank wanted to hire her to boost the productivity of his New York staff--a group of people who were struggling to copy after escaping their World Trade Center offices on September 11, 2001. Ann told the CEo that in order to fix it, she had to know what these people were feeling--they had to be able to talk openly about their grief. The CEO wanted absolutely no discussion of fear or grieving. Coombs says it was a six-figure contract. She turned it down because she felt employees were not being treated as they should be treated.
* What would you do? Sell someone something you feel they do not need or refuse to make the sale? That is what salepeople face in their jobs. Oh, a few months later Ann Coombs was contracted to work with the Bush administration to help government department deal with the post-September 11,2001, world. She took that job!

### The Golden Rule of Personal Selling
* When asked, "What would you like to learn in this course?" Steven Osborne, a student in my personal selling class, said, "I would like to know how to believe in a profession that many people do not trust." I sincerely hope you will be a believer in the value of sales integrity at the end of this sales course and be able to give Steven a positive perspective.
* Part of your answer will involve your understanding the definition of personal selling discussed earlier and the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. A rule is a prescribed guide for conduct or action. The **Golden Rule of Personal Selling** refers to the sales philosophy of unselfishly treating others as you would like to be treated. Reciprocity is not expected. Read the short essay at the back of this chapter in the Appendix titled "The Golden Rule of Personal Selling as Told by a Salesperson". This short story illustrates the importance of helping people through our jobs and our lives.
* Exhibit 2.7 in Chapter 2 provides examples of how people around the world view the Golden Rule. As you study the vaiours statements of the Golden Rule in Exhibit 2.7, be sure to note that all are phrased negatively except one--the last one. The negative form would teach behavior in this way: If you do not like to get cheated in a purchase, don't cheat others. The positive form, on the other hand, would say that if you like to receive the best price, then offer the best price to your customers.
* To help you understand the concept better, consider how the Golden Rule applies to a litter of kittens. one child watched in delight as the tiny kittens snuggled together, in the cardboard box where hercat had just delivered the litter. "Aw, isn't that cute?" She exclaimed. "They love each other so much that they're trying to keep each other warm." "Well not exactly", relied her mother. "Actually they're trying to keep themselves warm". The Golden Rule is all about trying to keep somebody else warm, even if it means that we get cold in the process. Stop a minute and think about how this applies to your life and the business world. This important concept will be applied to personal selling throughout the textbook. It is especially effective in explaining differences in salespeople and why so many people may have a negative view of some salespeople and a positive view of other salespeople.

### Salesperson Difference
* Garry Smith, a former consumer goods sales manager, and your author illustrate some of the differences between salespeople's approaches to personal selling today. In general, Exhibit 1.3 shows that differences can be explained by the extent of the person's self-interest. As Gallup's survey poll of Americans indicates, people view traditional salespeople as having their self-interest as a priority. This type of salesperson is preoccupited with his or her well-being--usually defined in terms of making money--and thus is selfish and can not be trusted.
* The salesperson following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling. However, places the interests of others before self-interest. Professional salespeople fall somewhere in between the traditional and Golden Rule salesperson in terms of how they view prospects and customers. As Exhibit 1.3 illustrates, as interest in serving others improves, a person's self-interest lessens. The more the salesperson considers the customer's interest, the better customer service.

```
Exhibit 1.3: Interest in serving the customer improves as our self-interst decreases

1. Traditional Salespeople
    * Do what they think they can get away with
    * Guided by self-interests
    * Attribute results to personal efforts
    * Seek recognition for efforts; sharing not important. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is life's main motivator

2. Professional Salespeople
    * Do what they are legally required to do.
    * Take care of customers
    * Attribute results to personal efforts, employer, customers, economy
    * Enjoy recognition, may share if it suits their purpose. Pride and ego driven
    * Money is important, but not to the customer's detriment

3. Golden Rule Salespeople
    * Do the right thing
    * Find others' interests most important
    * Attribute results to others.
    * Feel that an individual's performance is due to others, thus not motived by pride and ego.
    * Service most important, money is to be shared.


```

### Everybody Sells
* If you think about it, everyone sells. From an early age, you develop communication techniques for trying to get your way in life. You are involved in selling when you want someone to do something. For example, if you want to get a date, ask for a pay increase, return merchandise, urge your professor to raise your grade, or apply for a new job, you are selling. You use personal communication skills to persuade someone to act. Your ability to communicate effectively is a key to success in life.
* This is why so many people take sales courses. They want to improve their communication skills to be more successful in both their personal and business lives. The skills and knowledge gained from a selling course can be used by a student who plans to go into virtually any field, such as law, medicine, journalism, the military, or his or her own business.
* Selling is not just for salespeople; it is a must for everyone. In today's competitive environment, where good interpersonal skills are so valued, the lack of selling capability can put anyone at a disadvantage. So as you reat this book and progress through the course, think about how you can use the material both personally and in business.

### What Salespeople are Paid to Do
* In the short term, on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, salespeople are paid to sell--that is their job. When a sales manager sees one of her salespeople, the question is always, "Did you sell anything today?" Salespeople need to sell something "today" to meet the performance goals for:

        * Themselves, in order to serve others, earn a living, and keep their job
        * Their employer, because without the generation of revenues the company fails and thus can not serve others.
        * Their customers, because their products help customers fulfill their needs and help their organization grow.

* In the long run--month to month, year to year--salespeople must build positive long-term relationships with their customers. Why? Because they know, and now you know, that up to 80 percent or more of the future sales of many organizations come from present customers and customer referrals.
* salespeople need to close sales and at the same time maintain a great relationship with the buyer. Think about that last sentence. It is a very important thing to understand and learn. Salespeople want to sell to their present customers today, more tomorrow, and even more the day after that. How do you sell someone something and remain his or her business friend? You need to know how the Golden Rule of Personal Selling applies to the sales job. That is what this textbook is about.

### Why Choose a Sales Career
* Six major reasons for choosing a sales career are 1) service to others; 2) the wide variety of sales jobs available, 3) the freedom of being on your own; 4) the challenge of selling; 5) opportunity for advancement in a company; and 6) the rewards from a sales career

### Service: Helping Others
* When asked what she will look for in a career after graduating from college, a student of your author's, Jackie Pastrano, said, "I'd like to do sommething that helps other people." The sales career provides the opportunity for service and an emotional purpose in life gained from helping others. That is why this book's central core value is "service". Service is a major reason for choosing a sales career. For many, service is the number one reason.
* Service refers to making a contribution to the welfare of others. All of us want to do what Jackie hopes to do--help others! Would you like to help others? There are million of sales jobs and thus many opportunities to help people and organizations.

### A Variety of Sales Job Are Available
* As members of a firm's sales force, salespeople are a vital element in the firm's effort to market goods and services profitably. Personal selling accounts for major expenditures by most companies and presents a large number of career opportunities. There are millions of sales jobs, and the probability that at one time during your life you will have a sales job is high.
* There are also hundreds, maybe thousands, of different types of sales positions. Think about this! Almost every good and service you know of has a salesperson who sells it to one or more people in order to get the product to the final user. That is why so many sales jobs are available.

### Types of Sales jobs--Which is for You?
* Although there are numerous specific types of sales jobs, most salespeople work in one of three categories: as a retail salesperson, a wholesale salesperson, or a manufacturer's sales representative. These categories are classified according to the type of products sold and the salesperson's type of employer.

### Selling in Retail
* A retail salesperson sells goods or services to consumers for their personal, nonbusiness use. Retail selling is so important to a society that this book has numerous examples of it. Three common types of sellers who sell at retail are the 1) in-store salesperson, 2) direct seller who sells face-to-face away from a fixed store location, and 3) telephone salesperson.
* Look back at the definition of a retail salesperson. Think of all the different types of retail organizations selling something--retails such as bakeries, banks, caters, hotels, video stores, and travel agents, and stores selling clothes, electronics, flowers, food, and furniture. Each customer contact person takes your money and provides a good or service in return. Customer contact person is another name for a salesperson. **Although the title may be different, the job is the same--to help you buy.**
* **Direct sellers** sell face-to-face to consumers--typically in their homes--who use the products for their person use. An organization could have one salesperson or 3 million salespeople, like Amway.
* As in any type of job--including accountants, mechanics, and politicians--some retail salespeople do very little to help their customers. However, many retail salespeople are highly skilled professionals, commanding exceptionally high incomes fro their ability to service their customers. I personally know retail salespeople earning 40,000 a year selling shoes; 80,000 selling furniture, 110,000 selling jewelry, and 150,000 selling automobiles.

### Selling for a Wholesaler
* Wholesaler (also called distributors) buy products from manufacturers and other wholesalers and sell to other organizations. A wholesale salesperson sells product to parties for:

        * Resale, such as groccery retailers buying items and selling to consumers
        * use in producing other goods or services, such as a home builder buying electrical and plumbing supplies
        * Operating an organization, such as your school buying supplies

* Firms engaged in wholesaling are called wholesaling middlemen. Classifying wholsaling middlemen is difficult because they vary greatly in 1) the products they sell, 2) the markets to which they sell, and 3) their methods of operation. As there are so many different types, the discussion of types of wholesalers is beyond the scope of this book.

### Selling for a Manufacturer
* Manufacturers' salespeople work for organizations producing the product. The types of **manufacturer's sales representative** positions range from people who deliver milk and bread to the specialized salesperson selling highly technical industrial products. The salesperson working for a manufacturer may sell to other manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, or directly to consumers. There are five main types of manufacturer sales positions:

        1. An account representative calls on a large number of already establish customers in, for example, the food, textile, and apparel industries. This person asks for the order.
        2. A detail salesperson concentrates on performing promotional activities and introducing new products rather than directly soliciting orders. The medical detail salesperson seeks to persuade doctors, the indirect customers, to specify a pharmaceutical company's trade name product for prescriptions. The actual sales is ultimately made through a wholesaler or directly to pharmacists and hospitals that fill prescriptions.
        3. A sales engineer sells products that call for technical know-how and an ability to discuss technical aspects of the product. Expertise in identifying, analyzing, and solving customer problem is another critical factor. This type of selling is common in the oil, chemical, machinery, and heavy equipment industries because of the t echnical nature of their products.

        Greg Munoz, a sales engineer for the Dow Chemical Company, says,

        Our sales technique typically takes the team approach. Several of Dow's finest staff (technical, production, marketing, and support) and I work in unison to address the customer's specific needs. I am responsible for building the business relationship with the customer and directing resources and information toward securing a customer's plastic-resin business. Market managers and district sales managers coordinate pricing and positioning as the customer relates to the industry as a whole. Dow technicians engineer materials to meet or exceed the requirements specified for the application and work with the customer's production department to see that they perform accordingly. Customer service representatives handle order placement and product-delivery logistics while servicing the customer's information needs. Once the sale is closed, I follow up and maintain our profile while serving as the first line of communication and interface for the customer

        4. An industrial products salesperson, nontechnical, sells a tangible product to industrial buyers. No high degree of technical knowledge is required. Packaging materials manufacturers and office equipment sales representatives are nontechnical salespeople.

        5. A service salesperson, unlike the four preceding types of manufacturing salespeople, must sell the benefits of intangible or nonphysical products such as financial, advertising, or computer repair services. Services, like goods, are either technical or nontechnical in nature.

* Selling services is ordinarily more difficult than selling tangibles. The salesperson can show, demonstrate, and dramatize tangible products; the salesperson of intangible product can not. Intangibles often are difficult for the prospect to comprehend. People can not feel, smell, see, hear, or taste intangible products. This makes them more challenging to sell.

### Order-Takers versus Order-Getters
* Sales jobs vary widely in their nature and requipments. Some sales jobs require the salesperson only to take orders. **Order-takers** may ask what the customer wants or wait for the customer to order. They do not have a sales strategy and often use no sales presentation. Order-takers must be employed to bring in additional business that the employer probably would not obtain without their efforts. many never attempt to close the sale. They perform useful service. However, few truly create sales.
* On the other hand, the creative selling of tangible goods or intangible services in highly competitive lines (or where the product has no special advantage) moves merchandise that can not be sole in equal volume without a salesperson. These people are **order-getters**. They get new and repeat business using a creative sales strategy and a well-executed sales presentation. The salesperson has an infinitely more difficult selling situation than that faced by the order-taker. In this sense, the individual is a true salesperson, which is why this person usually earns so much more than the order-taker.
* **This salesperson has two selling challenges. First, the salesperson must often create discontent with what the prospect already has before beginning to sell constructively. Second, the salesperson often has overcome the most powerful and obstinate resistance. For example, the prospect may never have heard of the product and, at the outset, may have no desire whatsoever to purchase it. The prospect may even be prejudiced against it and may resent the intrusion of this stranger. In other instances, the prospect may want it but may want competing products more. Frequently, the prosepct can not afford it. To meet such sales situations successfully requires creative selling of the highest order.**
* Creative salespeople often are faced with selling to numerous people to get one order. This is the most difficult selling situation beccause the representative **may have to win over not only the decision maker, the one who can say yes, but also other persons who can not approve the order but who have the power to veto.**

### Freedom of Action: You're on Your Own
* A second reason why people choose a sales career is the freedom it offers. A sales job provides possibly the greative relative freedom of any career. Experienced employees in outside sales usually receive little direct supervision and may go for days, even weeks, without seeing their bosses.
* Job duties and sales goals are explained by a manager. Salespeople are expected to carry out their job duties and achieve goals with minimum guidance. They usually leave home to contact customers around the corner or around the world.

### Job Challenge is Always There
* Working alone with the responsibility of a territory capable of generating thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars in revenue for your company is a personal challenge. This environment adds great variety to a sales job. Salespeople often deal with hundreds of different people and firms over time. it is much like operating your own business, without the burdens of true ownership.

### Opportunities for Advance are Great
* Successful salespeople have many opportunities to move into top management positions. in many instances, this advancement comes quickly.
* A sales personnel career path, as Exhibit 1.7 depicts, is the upward sequence of job movements during a sales career. Occasionally, people without previous sales experience are promoted into sales management positions. However, 99 percent of the time, a career in sales management begins with an entry-level sales position. Firms believe that an experienced sales professional has the credibility, knowledge, and background to assume a higher position in the company.
* Most companies have two or three successive levels of sales positions, beginning at the junior or trainee level. Beginning as a salesperson allowes a person to:

        * Learn about the attitudes and activities of the company's salespeople
        * Become familiar with customer attitude toward the company, its products, and its salespeople.
        * Gain firsthand knowledge of products and their application, which is most important in technical sales.
        * Become seasoned in the business world

```
Exhibit 1.7: A sales personnel career path
sales trainee->salesperson->key account salesperson->District sales manager->Regional sales manager->Divisional sales manager->National sales manager->Vice president of marketing->President

```

* When asked why they like their jobs, first line sales managers say it is because of the rewards. By rewards, they mean both financial rewards and nonfinancial rewards, such as the great challenge and the feeling of making a valuable contribution to their salespeople and the company. Managers also frequently mention that this position represents their first major step toward the top. They have made the cut and are on the management team. Instead of having responsibility for 1 million in sales, as a salesperson does, the manager is responsible for 10 million.
* With success, various jobs throughout the sales force and in the corporate marketing department open up.  This can include sales training, sales analysis, advertising, and product management. Frequently, traveling the upward career path involves numerous moves from field sales to corporate sales, back to the field, then to corporate, back to the field, and so on. However, sales experience prepares people for more responsible jobs in the company.
* Success also creates financial rewards. The larger a company's revenues, the heavier the responsibility of the chief executive, and teh large the compensation. Today, it's common for a CEO of a large national corporation to receive compensation totaling more than 1 million annually.
* Leaving aside compensation at the top echelons, both corporate and field sales managers typically receive higher salaries than others (such as production, advertising, product, or personnel managers) at the same organizational level. Salary extended vacation and holiday periods; pension programs; health, accident, and legal insurance programs; automobiles and auto expenses; payment of professional association dues; educational assistance for themselves and sometimes for their families; financial planning assistance; company airplanes; home and entertainment expenses; and free country club membership. The higher the sales position, the greater the benefits offered. In addition to performance, salary typically is related to the following factors:

        * Annual sales volume of units managed.
        * Number of salespeople managed
        * Length of experience in sales
        * Annual sales volume of the firm

### Rewards: The Sky's the Limit
* As a salesperson, you can look forward to two types of rewards--nonfinancial and financial.

##### Nonfinancial Rewards
* Sometimes called psychological income or intrinsic rewards, nonfinancial rewards are generated by the individual, not given by the company. You know the job has been done well--for instance, when you have helped the buyer through the purchase of your product.
* Successfully meeting the challenges of the job produces a feeling of self-worth. You realize your job is important. Everyone wants to feel good about their job, and a selling career allows you to experience these good feelings and intrinsic rewards daily. Salespeople often report that the nonfinancial rewards of their jobs are just as important to them as financial rewards.
* After training, a salesperson is often given responsibility for a sales territory. The person then moves into a regular sales position. In a short time, the salesperson can earn the status and financial rewards of a senior sales position by contacting the larger, more important customers. Some companies refer to this function as a key account sales position.

### There are Two Career Paths
* Don't let Exhibit 1.7 mislead you--many salespeople prefer selling over managing people. They want to take care of themselves rather than others. In some companies, a salesperson may earn more money than even the manager, even the firm's president.
* Many companies recognize the value of keeping some salespeople in the field for their entire sales career. They do a good job, know their customers, and love what they are doing--so why promote them if they do not want to move up within the organization? However, many other people work hard to move into management.

### You Can Move Quickly into Management
* The first managerial level is usually the district sales manager's position. It is common for people to be promoted to this position within two or three years after joining the company. From district sales manager, a person may move into higher level of sales management.

### Financial Rewards
* Many are attracted to selling because in a sales career financial rewards are commonly based solely on performance. Many professional salespeople have opportunities to earn large salaries. Their salaries average even higher than salaries for other types of workers at the same organizational level.

### Is a Sales Career Right for You?
* It may be too early in life to determine if you really want to be a salesperson. The balance of this book will aid you in investigating sales as a career. Your search for any career begins with you. In considering a sales career, be honest and realistic. Ask your questions such as these:

        * What are my past accomplishments
        * What are my future goals
        * Do I want to have the responsibility of a sales job
        * Do I mind travel? How much travel is acceptable
        * How much freedom do I want in the job?
        * Do I have the personality characteristics for the job
        * Am I willing to transfer to another city? Another state?

Your answers to these questions can help you analyze the various types of sales jobs and establish criteria for evaluating job openings. Determine the industries, types of products or services, and specific companies in which you have an interest.
* College placement offices, libraries, and business periodicals offer a wealth of information on companies as well as sales positions in them. Conversations with friends and acquaintances who are involved within selling, or have been in sales, can give you realistic insight into what challenges, rewards, and disadvantages the sales vocation offers. To better prepare yourself to obtain a sales job, you must understand what companies look for in salespeople

### A Sales Manager's View of the Recruit
* The following discussion of what sales maanger consider when hiring a salesperson is based on a summary of a talk given by a sales manager to a sales class. It is reasonably representative of what companies look for when hiring salespeople

        We look for outstanding applicants who are mature and intelligent. They should be able to handle themselves well in the interview, demonstrating good interpersonal skills. They should have a well-thought-out career plan and be able to discuss it rationally. They should have a friendly, pleasing personality. A clean, neat appeanrance is a must. They should have a positive attitude, be willing to work hard, be ambitious, and demonstrate a good degree of interest in the employer's business field. They should have good grades and other personal, school, and business accomplishments. Finally, they should have clear goals and objectives in life. The more common characteristics on which applicants for our company are judged are 1) appearnace, 2) self-expression, 3) maturity, 4) personality, 5) experience, 6) enthusiasm, and 7) interest in the job

* People often consider sales career because they have heard that salespeople can earn good salaries. They think anyone can sell. T hese people have not considered all the facts. A sales job has high rewards because it also has many important responsibilities. Companies do not pay high salaries for nothing. As you will see in this book, a sales career involves great challenges that require hard work by qualified individuals. Let us review the characteristics of a successful salesperson.

### Success in Selling--What does it Take?
* Over the years, I have asked many salespeople and sales managers the question, "What helps make a salesperson successful?" The answer is contained in the words love, success, and person, as in the phrase "a person who loves success." As these words will indicate, to be a good salesperson today it helps to be a good person.
* As a student, I love phrases and acronyms to help me remember. That is why I use them here to help you remember and better understand what selling in today's business environment requires. As Exhibit 1.8 shows, the eight most frequently mentioned characteristics necessary to be successful in sales can be found in the words love and success. To help remember, think of the word ssuccess, spelled with four s's.

```

* Service to others
* Stamina for the job
* Use of Golden Rule
* Communication Ability
* Personal Characteristics

* Sales Knowledge

MAKING THE SALE

Don't Quit

        When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
        when the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
        When the funds are low and teh debts are high, 
        And you want to smile but you have to sigh,
        When care is pressing you down a bit--
        Rest if you must but don't you quit
        Life is queer with its twists and turns,
        As every one of us sometimes learns
        And many a person turns about
        When they might have won had they stuck it out
        Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
        You may succeed with another blow.
        Often the struggler has given up
        When he might have captured the victor's cup;
        And he learned too late
        When the night came down
        How close he was to the golden crown.
        Success is failure turned inside out--
        So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
        It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.

```

* **S--Success Begins with Love** The successful salesperson is an individual who loves selling, finds it exciting, and is strongly convinced that the product being sold offers something of great value. Of the eight work characteristics for sales success, love of selling is clearly number one. Love is at the center of success. It has been said that if you find a job you love, you will never work again

* **S--Service to Others** Today's salespeople make a contribution to the welfare of others through service. They are dream makers. They sell solutions to people's needs that make their dreams come true. Salespeople love to help others fulfill their needs through selling their products.

* **U--Use the Golden Rule of Selling** If salespeople do not know how to place the customer's needs first, how can they build a long-term relationship? People like to buy, not be sold. And they like to buy from people they know and trust. That is one reason today's salesperson needs to treat others as he or she would like to be treated.

* **C-Communication Ability** Good salespeople are good communicators. Great salespeople are great communicators. Whether it involves nonverbal or verbal communications, as discussed in Chapter 4, top salespeople speak the other person's language.

* **Characteristics for the Job** Can anyone be a successful salesperson? It helps to reach that goal if you possess the personal characteristics needed for a sales career. These characteristics are discussed after the remaining work characteristics are introduced. Let's continue our discussion of those work characteristics now.

* **E-Excels at Strategic Thinking** The sixth work characteristic is that high-performing salespeople tend to be strategic problem solvers for their customers. They can match their product's benefits with the customer's needs. Strategic customer sales planning is discussed more in Chapter 7.

* **S-Sales Knowledge at the M.D Level** Top professional salespeople have mastered the basic competencies of selling, which include product knowledge (see Chapter 5) and selling skills. As goods and services become more complex, companies place greater emphasis on training their salespeople and on salespeople training themselves. Salespeople must be experts on everything involved with their products, as a medical doctor is an expert. Remember, however, that knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch.

* **S-Stamina for the Challenge** Today's salesperson needs to be physically, mentally, and spiritually prepared to meet the daily challenges of a sales career. Body, mind, and soul play an important role in the level of a person's stamina. With physical preparedness comes mental strength. Exercise, for example, elevates your mood by increasing energy and simultaneously secreting adrenaline-like substances in the body that act as stimulants and antidepressants, according to the medical community. The increased feeling of well-being transmits itself to the body and mind. In this stressed-out world we all need stress relief. Exercise can help!
* Kenneth H. Cooper, MD, often referred to as the Fater of Aerobic, says, "it is easier to maintain good health through proper exercise, diet, and emotional balance than to regain it once is lost." Aerobic, strength training, and stretching are wonderful tool to reduce stress, help you feel better, focus better, and have more energy. If you are not actively using these techniques, try them for three months. Find out how exercise can help you! Be sure to check with you doctor before starting any exercise problem, though.
* For many people, personal spirituality or belief in a Supreme Being has a great impact upon physical and mental stamina and thus job performance. This is especially true if they feel their sales career is a calling. People's faith may direct everything they do on the job, ranging from how they treat customers to how ethically they act toward their employer.

* **C-Characteristics for the Job Examined** We skipped over the personal characteristics needed for a sales career earlier. Let's discuss them now. Certainly any discussion of what it takes to be successful in a sales job has to include the person's personal characteristics. As we have described selling, the salesperson wants to help people and thus build a long-term relationship. The question has been asked "How do you sell someone something and remain business friends?"
* In the movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, his teacher tells Harry that it is not our ability that show who we truly are but our choices. A salesperson can choose to be like the traditional salesperson we all disparage or the salesperson who is truly people oriented.

* **Caring, Job, Harmony** The most important characteristic of a ssuccessful salesperson is a **caring** attitude--caring about the customer's best interest. Many Golden Rule salespeople mean "love" when they say caring. The two terms are interchangeable. They love, and thus care about, everything connected with their work and life. Without caring, it's difficult--if not impossible--to possess the other eight characteristics of a Golden Rule saesperson.
* There is great **joy** in truly caring for one's customers, and this job motivates a salesperson to care for customers continuously. Because the salesperson is concerned with what is best for the customer, there ise a sense of peace or **harmony** in the relationship. The custoemr can trust the salesperson, so all fear of being taken advantage of is removed.

* **Patience, Kindness, Moral Ethics** Salespeople are often under pressure to make the sales today! They need to be able to handle the pressure to sell now using **patience** in their working relationship with the customer. Let the customer decide when to buy instead of pressuring for a quick decision. A buyer needs information to make an educated decision. Often this takes time and great patience. Patience in closing the sale goes a long way toward building a long-term relationship. Buyers do not like to be pressured into making a quick decision. Do you? Neither do I! People like to buy, not be sold.
* Your actions speak louder than your words. People want to see you "walk the talk, not talk the talk." Having patience shows that the salesperson understands the customer's needs and wants to help. This is a display of **kindness**, a kind person is patient and compassionate. Salespeople must be kind to their customers in order to show that they aren't interested solely in making the sale. Remember, we are interested in following the Golden Rule of Personal Selling--acting in the best interest of others, not just making sales. A salesperson who follow the Golden Rule is **morally ethical** individual whom the customer can trust.

* **Faithful, Fair, Self-Control** A salesperson who cares, likes the job, is good to work with, and is patient, kind, and morally ethical is certainly someone who will be **faithful** in taking care of customers. The salesperson will spend the time necessary to help, not just make the sale and never be heard from again until the next sales call. We all want to be thought of as ethical. Faithfulness is an ethical virtue. It shows the employer, customers, and competitors that the salesperson is **fair** to all. Customers can trust this salesperson.

* **Self-Control is Most Difficult** Now we come to **self-control**, which is the most difficult trait for a salesperson to develop. This is why we discuss it last. Self-control involves restraining our emotions, passions, and desires usually for self-gain. How do salespeople control themsevles by being patient in closing the sale, for example? Remember, the salesperson must sell to make a living and keep the job. Thus, there is considerable incentive for the salesperson to use pressure or lie, for example, to compel the customer to buy something that may not be needed or that is falsely represented.

* **Self-Control Involves Discipline** Self-control also refers to the needed discipline to rise early, work late, and prepare for the next day in the evening. Often the biggest challenge to success is not out there in the sales territory; it is within us. We can not achieve unless we are willing to pay the price--discipline.
* Discipline also includes creating time for family--parents, spouse, and children. So often we caught up in the American way of wanting to be rich and famous that we forgot about the others in our life. Instead we must discipline ourselves to set priorities. What comes first, your job or your family? For me, it should always be family before job. Setting priorities requires willpower many of us do not have. Do you ever wonder why t here are so many divorces in America and so many children raised in one-parent homes? Misplacing priorities by not putting family first is the number one contributor to the breakdown of American families. Self-control and discipline are thus very important personal characteristics for all of us, no matter what our careers.
As you see in Exhibit 1.10, the list of personal characteristics needed to be a good salesperson in today's marketplace is a long one. No doubht your instructor will add to this list, and you undoubtedly will think of other characteristics as well. These characteristics make salespeople good citizens in the business world. However, sadly, it seems that all of us do not have the ability or desire to place the customer first.

```
Exhibit 1.10: Personal Characteristics needed to sell for building long-term relationships

* Caring for custoemr
* Joy in work
* Harmony in relationship
* Patience in closing the sale
* Kind to people
* morally ethical
* Faithful to word
* Fairness in the sale[
* Self-control in emotions

```

* **One of the Kindest People** Many years ago a man named John Wesley, known as one of the kindest men who ever walked on earth, talked about a simple rule of life. Wesley said he tried to "Do all the good he can by all the means he can in all the places he can at all the times he can to all the people he can as long as ever he can" How would you like to deal with a salesperson who followed both Wesley's rule of life and the Golden Rule? Me too.


### Do Success Characteristics Describe You
* What do you think? Do these success characteristics describe you? Are you willing to incorporate them into your life? You may have to go beyond your normal limits. Only your self-imposed limitation can hold you back. If you fail to realize success or if your success is limited, your own preconceptions may be the cause by throwing an invisible barrier across your path. 

## Relationship Selling
* Salespeople are no longer adversaries who manipulate people for personal gain. They want to be consultants, partners, and problem solvers for customers. Their goal is to build a long-term relationship with clients. Salespeople seek to benefit their employer, themselves, and customers.
* In recent years, the distinction between a salesperson and a professional has blurred because the salesperson of today is a pro. Many salespeople know more about their field and product than the buyer. The expertise enables the seller to become the buyer's partner, a counselor on how to solve problems. Today's salesperson professionally provides information that helps customers make intelligent actions to achieve their short- and long-term objectives. Service and follow-up are then provided to ensure satisfaction with the purchase. This build customer loyalty--a relationship

# Chapter 4: Communication for Relationship Building: It's Not All Talk

## Facing a Sales Challenge
* Amos Skaggs, purchasing agent, stands as a salesperson enters his office. "Hi, Mr Skaggs," the salesperson says, offering his hand. Skaggs returns a limp, one-second handshake and sits down behind his desk. He begins to open his afternoon mail, almost as though no one else was in the room.
* The salesperson sits down and begins his canned sales talk by saying, "Mr Skaggs, I'm here to show you how your company can lower manufacturing costs by 10 percent" Skaggs lays his mail down on his desk, leans back in his chair, crosses his arms, and with a growl says: "I'm glad to hear that. You know something, young fellow, pretty soon it won't cost us anything to manufacture our product." "Why is that?" the salesman mumbles, meekly looking down to the floor. "Well, you are the ninth person I've seen today who has offered to save us 10 percent on our costs."
* Skaggs stands up, leans over the table, and while peering over his glasses says slowly. "I believe I've heard enough sales pitches for one day." The initially enthusiastic salesperson now apologetically says, "If this is not a good time for you, sir, I can come back at a later date."
* The problem facing the salesperson is common. The buyer has been seeing salespeople all day. Basically, they say the same thing. "Buy from me and I'll save you money" The buyer has communicated his feelings toward the salesperson both verbally and nonverbally. What message has Skaggs sent to the salesperson? If you were the salesperson, what might you do now?

* Although many other factors are crucial to sales success, the ability to communicate effectively is of prime importance. To convincingly convey this important sales skill, this chapter directly applies a basic communication model to the buyer-seller interaction. We describe several factors influencing communication along with possible barriers to effective communication. We also examine the often ignored--though always critical--topic of nonverbal communication. The balance of this chapter relates some techniques to improve sales communication.

## The Tree of Business Communication
* What if you could read someone's mind? What if you could tell what he or she is thinking? Wow, wouldn't that be cool! How would you use the knowledge of what is going on in a person's mind about what you are saying--for helping or selling purposes? For the other person's best interst or your best interest? People have ears, but can not hear. People have eyes, but can not see. People have two ears and one mouth but do more talking than listening. What are your answers for these four questions? How do the three "People have..." sayings relate to your life.
* This chapter, and the last chapter, provides several of the little known secrets about how to read people's minds. Body language, coupled with asking questions periodically as you talk with someone and listening to his or her replies, is a great way to better understand what is going on in someone's mind. Questions, watching nonverbals, listening, talking as needed are secrets to successfully helping others in a sales situation. It also works in your everyday life. Try them! use these secrets of effective communication for building long-term relationships based on the Golden Rule of Selling. Ethical service builds relationships and is based on the truth.

## Communication: It Takes Two
* **Communication**, in a sales context, is the act of transmitting verbal and nonverbal information and understanding between seller and buyer. This definition presents communication as an exchange process of sending and receiving messages with some type of response expected between seller and buyer.
* This sound simple, right? But have you ever had someone talk to you and realize you did not hear what was said? "You have eyes but do not see; you have ears but do not hear" is a saying that dates back thousands of years. The wise saying is important to all of us, including salespeople, in our daily living. Salespeople have to understand the many ways people communicate with them.
* Communication channels during the sales presentation take many forms. Ideas and attitude can be effective communicated by media other than language. Actually, in a normal two-person conversation, less than 35 percent of the social meaning utilizes verbal components. Said another way, much of the social meaning in a conversation is converyed nonverbally. Furthermore, what you say verbally is not always what you actually mean. Exhibit 4.1 expands on this point by illustrating the psychological though processes of both the speaker and the listener.
* Research has found that face-to-face communication is composed of verbal, vocal, and facial communication messages. One equation presents the total impact of commmunicated messages as equal to 7 percent verbal, 38 percent tone of voice, and 55 percent nonverbal expressions. If one recognizes these findings as a reasonable approximation of the total communicative process, then uninformed salespeople actually ignore a major part of the communication process that occurs during buyer-seller interaction. How the sales message is given can be as important as making the sale as what is said. Thus, nonverbal communication are important in communication between buyer and seller. An awareness of nonverbal communication is a valuable tool in successfully making a sale.
* Vocal communication includes such factors as voice quality, pitch, inflection, and pauses. A salesperson's use of vocal factors can aid in sales presentation, too. Along with verbal, vocal, and nonverbal communication, many other elements also are involved in sales communication.

## Salesperson-Buyer Communication Process Requires Feedback
* A basic communication model that depicts how the salesperson-buyer communication process is shown in Exhibit 4.2. Basically, communication occurs when a sender transmit a message through some type of medium to a receive who responds to that message. Exhibit 4.2 presents a model that contains eight major communication elements. These elements are defined as follows:

        * Source. The source of communication (also called the communicator); in our case, it's the salesperson
        * Encoding process. The salesperson's conversion of ideas and concepts into the language and materials used in the sales presentation
        * Message. The information intended to be conveyed in the sales presentation
        * Medium. The form of communication used in the sales presentation and discussion; most frequently words, visual materials, and body language
        * Decoding process. Receipt and translation (interpretation) of the information by the receiver (prospective buyer)
        * Receiver. The person the communication is intended for; in our case, it's the prospect or buyer
        * Feedback. Reaction to the communication as transmitted to the sender. This reaction may be verbal, nonverbal, or both.
        * Noise. Factors that distort communication between buyer and seller. Noise includes barriers to communication, which we will discuss later.

* This model portrays the communication process. A salesperson should know how to develop a sales presentation (encoding) so that the buyer obtains maximum understanding of the message (decoding). The salesperson should use communication media that most effectively communicate a specific sales message. Clear verbal discussion, visual aids such as pictures or diagrams, and models or samples of the product are several types of media a salesperson might use in communicating a sales message.
* Studies have shown that people retain 10 percent of what they read, 20 percent of what they see, 30 percent of what they hear, and 50 percent of what they hear and see. If possible, it is important to incorporate into your presentation communication that appeals to all five senses (sight, hearing, smell, feel, taste). This is challenging to do!
* One-way communication occurs when the salesperson talks and the buyer only listens. The salesperson needs a response or feedback from the buyer to know if communication occurs. Does the buyer understand the message? Once feedback or interaction and understanding between buyer and seller exist in a commmunication process, two-way communication has been established.
* Two-way communication is essentialy to make the sale. The buyer must understand your message's information to make a buying decision. Two-way communication gives the salesperson the ability to present a product's benefit, instantly receive buyer reactions, and answer questions. Buyer usually react both verbally and nonverbally to your presentation

```
Say What You Mean
* At least six message are involved in the communication process.

        1. What you mean to say
        2. What you really say
        3. What the other person hears
        4. What the other person thinks is heard
        5. What the other person says about what you said
        6. What you think the other person said about what you said

* It gets complicated, doesn't Sue and I were looking at a gorgeous moon together under romantic circumstances. As we shared the moment, how was i actually feeling? I was feeling romantic. If we followed the six messages, the incident would have looked something like this:

        1. What you mean to say ("the moon puts me in a romantic mood")
        2. What you really say ("Isn't that a brilliant moon?")
        3. What the other person hears ("The moon is bright")
        4. What the other person thinks she hears. ("Yes, it's bright enough for a walk")
        5. What the other person says about what you said. ("Yes, it's bright eough to hit a gold ball by")
        6. What you think the other person said about what you said. ("I don't feel romantic")

* We can miss each other's wavelengths completely by the time the six message are completed with even realizing what has happened. All of us are constantly in the process of encoding and decoding messages.
* We need to learn to ask questions or restate the point to clarify meaning. To say what we mean straightforwardly must be our constant goal in order for those around us to discard all decoding devices.

```

## Nonverbal Communication: Watch for It
* Recognition and analysis of nonverbal communication in sales transactions is relatively new. Only in the past 10 to 15 years has the subject been formally examined in detail. The presence and use of nonverbal communication, however, has been acknowledged for years. In the early 1900s, Sigmund Freud noted that people can not keep a secret even if they do not speak. A person's gestures and actions reveal hidden feelings about something.
* People communicate nonverbally in several ways. Four major **nonverbal** communication channels are the physical space between buyer and seller, appearance, handshake, and body movements.

## Concept of Space
* The concept of **territorial space** refers to the area around the self that a person will not allow another person to enter without consent. Early experiments in territorial space dealt with animals. These experiments determined that higher-status members of a group often are affored a freedom of movement that is less available to those of lower status. This idea has been applied to socially acceptable distance of space that human being keep between themselves in certain situations. Territorial space can easily be related to the selling situation.
* Space considerations are important to salespeople because violations of territorial space without customer consent may set off the customer's deense mechanisms and create a barrier to communications. A person (buyer) has four main types of distance to consider--intimate (up to 2 feet); personal (2 to 4 feet); social (4 to 12 feet); and public (greater than 12 feet)
* **Intimate space** of up to 2 feet, or about arm's length, is the most sensitive zone, since it is reserved for close friends and loved ones. To enter intimate spacein the buyer-seller relationship, for some prospects, could be socially unacceptable--possibly offensive.
* During the presentation, a salesperson should carefully listen and look for signs that indicate the buyer feels uncomfortable--perhaps that the salesperson is too close. A buyer may deduce from such closeness that the salesperson is attempting to dominate or overpower the buyer. This feeling can result in resistance to the salesperson. If such uneasiness is detected, the salesperson should move back, which reassures the customer.
* **Personal space** is the closest zone a stranger or business acquaintance is normally allowed to enter. Even in this zone, a prospect may be uncomfortable. Barriers, such as a desk, often reduce the threat implied when someone enters this zone.
* **Social space** is the area normally used for a sales presentation. Again, the buyer often uses a desk to maintain a distance of 4 feet or more between buyer and seller. Standing while facing a seated prospect may communicate to the buyer that the salesperson seems too dominating. Thus, the salesperson should normally stay seated to convey a relaxed manner.
* A salesperson should consider beginning a presentation in the middle of the social distance zone, 6 to 8 feet, to avoid the prospect's erecting negative mental barriers. This is especially true if the salesperson is not a friend of the prospect.
* **Public space** can be used by the salesperson making a presentation to a group of people. It is similar to the distance between teacher and student in a classroom. People are at east, and thus easy to communicate with, at this distance because they do not feel threatened by the salesperson.

### Space Threats
* The territorial imperative causes people to feel that they should defned their space or territory against **space threats**. The salesperson who pulls upa chair too close, takes over all or part of the prospect's desk, leans on or over the desk, or touches the objects on the desk runs the risk of invading a prospect's territory. Be careful not to create defensive barriers. However, should you sense a friendliness between yourself and the prospect, use territorial space to your benefit.

### Space Invasion
* The prospect who allows you to enter or invade personal and intimate space is saying, "Come on into my space; let's be friends." Now you can use space to your advantage.
* In most offices, the salesperson sits directly across the desk from the prospect. The prospect controls the space arrangement. This defensive barrier allows the prospect to control much of the conversation and remain safe from **space invation.** often, seating in prearranged and it could be a space threat if you moved your chair when calling on a prospect for the first time.
* However, if you have a choice between a chair across the desk or beside the desk, take the latter seat, as shown in Exhibit 4.3. Sitting beside the prospect lowers the desk communication barrier. If you are friends with the buyer, move your chair to the side of the desk. This helps create a friendly, cooperative environment between you and the buyer.

## Communication through Appearance and the Handshake
* Often common methods of nonverbal communication are signals conveyed by a person's physical appearance and handshake. Once territorial space has been established, general appearance is the next medium of nonverbal communication a salesperson conveys to a customer. Appearance not only conveys information such as age, sex, height, weight, and physicaly characteristics, but it also provides much data on personality. For instance, hairstyle is one of the first things a buyer notices about a salesperson.

### Style Hair Carefully
* Hairstyle traditionally has been important in evaluating personal appearance. Today's salespeople must consider the type of customer they call and adjust their hairstyles accordingly. Both male and female salespeople should visit a hairstylist. Though recently decreasing somewhat in popularity, some male salepeople wear facial hair. Salespeople should carefully consider their grooming and its impact on customers' perceptions. Some companies ask males salespersons to be clean shaven and wear conservative haircuts. Their female salespersons are asked to choose a simple, business like, shoulder-length hairstyle. Other companies leave grooming up to each individual. Your grooming objective is to eliminate communication barriers. Your grooming can convey a favorable first impression. Should your company not have a policy on grooming, examining your customers' grooming before deciding on your style.

### Dress as a Professional
* Wardrobe has always been a major determinant of sales success, and today it is emphasized as never before. A variety of books and articles have appeared on proper dress for businesspeople. These books espouse the doctrine that men and women sales representatives should wear conservative, serious clothing that projects professionalism, just the right amound of authority, and a desire to please the customer. Sporty clothing is believe to accentuate sales aggressiveness, which can place a purchasing agent on the defensive and result in lost sales.
* Many companies believe that decision rules exist for every major clothing item and accessory, but these are derivatives of one basic commandment--dress in a simple, elegant style. Xerox, IBM, and other large companies have incorporated these ideas into their sales training and daily policies. These firms encourage sales personnel to wear dark, conservative clothing. This practice is designed to project conservative, stable corporate image to both customers and the general public.
* Exhibit 4.4 and the "Dress for Success" appendix at the end of this chapter illustrate several key considerations for appropriate dress and grooming. Before reading on, look over the appendix at the end of this chapter to better prepare you for the business world.
* If you are uncertain about what to do, visit several retailers. Make sure at least one retailer is a specialty store. They will have the latest styles and spend time with you. Tell the salespeople what you are looking for and see what they say. Think of this as an investment in yourself because it is expensive to build a wardrobe. However, you are worth it!
* Clothes, accessories, and shoes are important, but do not forget personal grooming, such as skin care and hairstyle, as noted above. Learn to recognize image symbols in business dress and use them to your advantage. Be cautious about becoming too individualistic--the unspoken message in most companies is that freedom in dress may be a privilege of rank. Remember, too, that these guides for dress, including the remainder of the chapter, also apply to selling yourself in job interviews.
* The nonverbal messages that salespeople emit through appearance should be positive in all sales situations. Characteristics of the buyer, cultural aspects of a sales territory, and the type of product being sold all determine a mode of dress. In considering these aspects, create a business wardrobe that sends positive, nonverbal messages in every sales situation.

### Shake Hands Firmly and Look People in the Eye
* Once you have determine appropriate dress and hairstyle, the next nonverbal communication channel to consider is your contact with a prospect through the handshake. The handshake is said to have evolved from a gesture of peace between warriors. By joining hands, two warriors were unable to bear arms against one another (assuming that a shield--not a weapon--was held in the other hand)
* Today, a handshake is the most common way for two people to touch one another in a business situation, and some people feel that it is a revealing gesture. A firm handshake is more intense and is indicative of greater liking and warmer feelings. A prolong handshake is more intimate than a brief one, and it could cause the customer discomfort, especially in a sales call on a new prospect. A loosely clasped, col, or limp handshake is usually interpreted as indicating that someone is aloof and unwilling to become involved. This cold fish handshake is also perceived as unaffectionate and unfriendly.
* General rules for a successful handshake include extending your hand first--if appropriate. Remember, however, a few people may be uncomfortable shaking hands with a stranger. At times, you may want to allow your customer to initiate the gesture. Maintain eye contact with the customer during the handshake, gripping the hand firmly. These actions allow you to initally establish an atmosphere of honesty and mutual respect--starting the presentation in a positive manner.

Exhibit 4.5: Five tips for international handshaking
1. International protocol dictates that you shake hands with everyone in a room--omissions are noticed, and are considered a rejection.
2. Women should initiate handshakdes, and shake hands with other women and men. Not extending her hand to a European male will cause an American businesswoman to lose credibility
3. Western and Eastern European reshake hands whenever they 're apart for even a shorter period of time
4. French and Japanese businesspeople shake hands with one firm gesture. In Japan, the handshake may be combined with a slight bow, which should be returned.
5. In Arab countries, handshakes are a bit limp and last longer than typical American handshakes. Latin Americans also tend to use a lighter, longering handshake. In all cases, don't pull your hand away too soon, such a gesture will be interpreted as a rejection.

### Body Language Gives You Clues
* From birth, people learn to communicate their needs, likes, and dislikes through nonverbal means. The salesperson can learn much from a prospect's raised eyebrow, a smile, a touch, a scowl, or reluctance to make eye contact during a sales presentation. The prospect can communicate with you literally without uttering a word. An ability to interpret these signals is an invaluable tool to the successful sales professional. In conjunction with interpretation of body language, the salesperson's skillful use and control of physical actions, gestures, and overall body position also are helpful.
* The buyer can send nonverbal signals via five communication modes. They are the body angle, facial expression and movement or position, hand movements or position, and leg position. (Exhibit 4.6 shows examples). These modes generally send three types of messages: 1. acceptance, 2. caution, 3. disagreement

* **Acceptance signals** indicate that your buyer is favorably inclined toward you and your presentation. These signals give you the green light to proceed. While this may not end in a sale, at the least the prospect is saying, "I am willing to listen" What you are saying is both acceptable and interesting. Some common acceptance signals include these:

        * Body angle: Leaning forward or upright at attention
        * Face. Smailing, pleasant expression, relaxed, eyes examining visual aids, direct eye contact, positive voice tones
        * Hands. Relaxed and generally open, perhaps performing business calculations on paper, holding on as you attempt to withdraw a product sample or sales materials, firm handshake
        * Arms. Relaxed and generally open
        * Legs. Crossed and pointed toward you or uncrossed.

* Salespeople frequently rely only on facial expression as indicators of acceptance. This practice may be misleading since buyers may consciously control their facial expressions. Scan each of the five key body areas to verify your interpretation of facial signals. A buyer who increases eye contact, maintain a relaxed position, and exhibits positive facial expressions gives excellent acceptance signals.
* Acceptance signals indicate the buyers perceive that your product might meet their needs. You have obtain their attention and interest. You are free to continue with your planned sales presentation.
* **Caution signals** should alert you that buyers are either neutral or skeptical toward what you say. Caution signals are indicated by these characteristics:

        * Body angle. Leaning away from you
        * Face. Puzzled, little or no expression, averted eyes or little eye contact, neutral or questioning voice tone, saying little, and then asking only a few questions.
        * Arms. Crossed, tense
        * Hands. Moving, fidgeting with something, clasped, weak handshake
        * Legs. Moving, crossed away from you

* Caution signals are important for you to recognize and adjust to for two main reasons. First, they indicate blocked communication. Buyers' perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs regarding your presentation may cause them to be skeptical, judgmental, or uninterestedin your product. Even though you may have their attention, they show little interest in or desire for your product.
* Second, if caution signals are not handled properly, they may evolved into disagreement signals, which causes a communication breakdown and makes a sale difficult. Proper handling of caution signals requires that you

        * Adjust to the situation by slowing down or departing from your planned presentation
        * Use open-ended questions to encourage your buyers to talk and express their attitudes and beliefs. How might we improve the efficiency of your workforce? and What do you think about this benefit? are examples of open-ended querstions.
        * Carefully listen to what buyers say, and respond directly
        * Project acceptance signals. Be positive, enthusiatic, and smile. Remember, you are glad to be there to help buyers satisfy their needs. Refrain from projecting caution signals even if a buyer does so. if you project a positive image in this situation, there is greater probability that you will change a caut ion light to a green one and make the sale.

* Your objective in using these techiques is to chagne the yellow caution signal to the green go-ahead signal. If you continue to receive caution signals, proceed carefully with your presentation. Be realistic and alert to the possibility that the buyer may begin to believe that your product is not beneficial and begin sending disagreement or red-light signals
* **Disagreement signals** tell you immediately to stop the planned presentation and quickly adjust to the situation. Disagreements, or red-light signals, indicate that you are dealing with a person becoming uninterested in your product. Anger or hostility may develop if you continue the presentation. Your continuation can cause a buyer to feel an unacceptable level of sales pressure, resulting in a complete communication breakdown. Disagreement signals may be indicated by these signs:

        * Body angle. Retracted shoulders, leaning away from you, moving the entire body back from you, or wanting to move away
        * Face. Tense, showing anger, wrinkled face and brow, little eye contact, negative voice tones, or sudden silence.
        * Arms. Tense, crossed over chest.
        * Hands. Motions of rejection or disapproval, tense and clenched, weak handshake.
        * Legs. Crossed and away from you

* You should handle disagreement signals as you did caution signals, by using open-ended questions and projecting acceptance signals. There are four additional techniques to use. First, stop your planned presentation. There is no use in continuing until you have changed disagreement signals into caution or acceptance signals. Second, temporarily reduce or eliminate any pressure on the person to buy or to participate in the conversation. Let the buyer relax as you slowly move back to your presentation. Third, let your buyer know you are aware that something upsetting has occured. Show that you are there to help, not to sell at any cost. **Finally, use direct questions to determine a buyer's attitudes and beliefs such as "What do you think of...?" or "Have I said something you do not agree with?"**

#### Body Guidelines
* Over time, you will know customers well enough to understand the meaning of their body movements. Although a prospect may say no to making a purchase, body movement may indicate uncertainty.
* Exhibit 4.7 relates some common nonverbal signals that buyers may project. The interpretation of most body language is obvious. Be cautious in interpreting an isolated gesture, such as assuming that little eye contact means the prospect is displeased with what you are saying. Instead, concentrate on nonverbal cues that are part of a cluster or pattern. Let's say your prospect begins staring at the wall. That is a clue that may mean nothing. You continue to talk. Now, the prospect leans back in the chair. That is another clue. By itself, it may be meaningless, but in conjunction with the first clue, it begins to take on meaning. Now, you see the prospect turn away, legs crossed, brow wrinkled. You now have a cluster of clues forming a pattern. it is time to adjust or change your presentation.
* In summary, remember that nonverbal communication is well worth considering in selling. A salesperson ought to

        * Be able to recognize nonverbal signals
        * Be able to interpret them correctly
        * Be prepared to alter a selling strategy by slowing, changing, or stopping a planned presentation
        * Respond nonverbally and verbally to a buyer's nonverbal signals.

* Effective communication is essential in making a sale. Nonverbal communication signals are an important part of the total communication process between buyer and seller. Professional salespeople seek to learn and understand nonverbal communication to increase their sales success.


### Barriers to Communication
* Like the high hurdler, a salesperson often must overcome a multit ude of obstacles. These obstacles are more aptly called barriers to communication. Consider this example:
* Salesperson Joe Jones heard that the XYZ Company buyer, Jake Jackson, was displeased with the company's present supplier. Jones had analyzed XYZ's operation and knew that his product could save the company thousands of dollars a year. Imagine Jones's surprise when Jackson terminated the visit quickly with no sale and no mention of a future appointment
* Jones told his boss about the interview: "Jackson kept asking me where I went to schokol, whether I want coffee, and how I liked selling while i was trying to explain to him the features, advantages, and benefits of our product. Suddenly, Jackson stopped the interview". Jones asked the boss, "What did I do wrong? I know he needed our product."
* The buyer was sending Jones signals that he likes doing business with people he knows. He was a "feeler", as discussed in Chapter 3. The buyer did not watn to get get down to business immediately. He wanted to visit for a while. No true communication was ever established between Jackson and Jones, which caused Jones to misread the customer and incorrectly handle the situation.
* Salespeople, as illustrated in this example, often lose sales by failing to recognize3 communication barriers between buyer and seller. The main reasons communication breaks down in the sales situation include these (see Exhibit 4.8)

1. **Differences in perception.** If the buyer and seller do not share a common understanding of information contained in the presentation, communication breaks down. The closer a buyer's and seller's perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs, are the stronger communication will be between them. Cultural differences are easily misperceived by buyers and sellers.
2. **Buyer does not recognize a need for product** Communication barriers exist if the salesperson is unable to convince the buyer of a need, and/or that the salesperson represents the best supplier to buy from.
3. **Selling pressure** There is a fine line between what is acceptable sales pressure or enthusiasm and what the buyer perceives as a high-pressure sales technique. A pushy, arrogant selling style can quickly cause the prospect to erect a communication barrier.
4. **Information overload.** You may present the buyer with an excess of information. The overload may cause confusion, perhaps offend, and the buyer will stop listening. For example, the engineer making a presentation to a buyer who is not an engineer may concentrate on the technical aspects of a product when the buyer only wants a small amount of information.
5. **Disorganized sales presentation** Sales presentations that seem unorganized to the buyer tend to cause frustration or anger. Buyers commonly expect you to understand their needs or problems and to customize your sales presentation to their individual situations. If you fail to do this, communication can fall apart.
6. **Distraction** When a buyer receives a telephone call or someone walks into the office, distractions occur. A buyer's thoughts may become sidetracked, and it may be difficult to regain attention and interest.
7. **Poor listening**. At times, the buyer may not listen to you. This often occurs if you do all or most of the talking--not allowing the buyer to participate in the conversation
8. **How and what you say**. What we say probably affects more people than any other action we take. Here are four common speech patterns. The first two should be copied, and the last two should be avoided

        a. The Controlled Talk--those with this speech pattern think before speaking, know when silence is best, and give wise advice
        b. The Caring Talk--those with this speech pattern speak truthfully while seeking to encourage
        c. The Conniving Talk--those with this speech pattern are filled with wrong motive, gossip, slander, and a desire to twist truth
        d. The Careless Talk--those with this speech pattern are filled with lies, salty language, and quick-tempered words--which can lead to self-destruction in sales

9. **Not adapting to buyer's style** sitting in on a sales call with a young salesperson selling high-priced industrial equipment, it became clear that the two were not communicating. The salesperson, who preferred telling to showing, kept talking about the product. But the visually oriented client wanted to see a picture of it. Eventually, the conversation deteriorated into a show versus tell confrontation.

        It was the classic sales miscommunication. Amazingly, the rep had product brochures in his briefcase. But he didn't bring them out because he was locked into his own form of communication. It is critical for salespeople to use different communication styles as discussed in Chapter 3. Most successful salespeople have learned to match their customers' communication styles. Remember the Golden Rule and adjust to the other peron.

* The nine barriers to communication just listed are not the only ones that may occur. As in the examnple of Joe Jones, the buyer may actually need the product and the salesperson may have excellenet product knowledge and believe that the sales presentation was good, yet because of communication barriers, the buyer reject the salesperson and the product. As a salesperson, constantly seek ways to recognize and overcome communication barriers, and identify and satisfy buyer needs t hrough persuasive communication.

## Master Persuasive Communication to Maintain Control
* To become a better communicator, consider two major element of communication. First, always strive to improve the message and its delivery in the sales presentation. You need to be a capable encoder. Second, improve your ability to determine what the buyer is communicating to you. To do so, you need to be a good listener or decoder. A good sales communicator knows how to effectively encode and decode during a presentation.
* Salespeople want to be good communicators to persuade people to purchase their products. **Persuasion** means the ability to change a person's belief, position, or course of action. The more effective you are at communicating, the greater your chances of being successful at persuasion.
* The chapters on the selling process go into greater detail on specific persuasion techniques. For now, let's review several factors to develop persuasive communications. These factors relate to several components of the communication model shown in Exhibit 4.2: feedback, empathy, simplicity, listening, attitude, and proof statements.

## Feedback Guides Your Presentation
* Learn how to generate feedback to determine whether your listener has received your intended message. Feedback does not refer to any specific type of listening behavior by the buyer but rather to a recognizable response. A shake of the head, a frown, or an effort to say something are all signals to the salesperson. If the salesperson fails to notice or respond to these signals, no feedback can occur, which means faulty or incomplete communication. A salesperson's observation of feedback is like an auto racer's glances at the tachometer. Both aid in ascertaining a receiver's response.
* Often, feedback must be sought openly because the prospect does not always give it voluntarily. By interjecting into the presentation questions that require the customer to give a particular response, you can stimulate feedback. Questioning, sometimes called probing, allows the salesperson to determine the buyer's attitude toward the sales presentation. **Probing** refers to gathering information and uncovering customer needs using one or more questions.

``` 
Don't Complicate Things
* How can you simplify the following statements

1. A mass of concentrated earthly material perennially rotating on its axis will not accumulate an accretion of bryophytic vegetation
2. Individuals who are perforce constrained to be domiciled in vitreous structures of patent frangibility should on no account employ petrous formations as projectils.
3. A superabundance of talent skilled in the preparation of gastronomic concoctions will impair the quality of certain potable solution made by immensing a gallinaceous bird in embullient Adam's ale

Answers
1. A rolling stone gathers no moss
2. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
3. Too many cooks spoil the broth

```

* MCI Communication included this type of feedback in their sales training sessions. MCI sales trainers suggested to their salespeople that they use questions in their presentations. These were some of the questions:

        * Do you think you are paying too much for telecommunications equipment?
        * Are you happy with the service now being provided
        * Are you happy with the equipment your present supplier has installed for your company

* These questions were intended to draw negative responses from the customers concerning the relationship with their present supplier. They provided the MCI salespeople with a method of determining how the prospect felt about the competitor. These responses allow the salesperson to discuss the specific features, advantages, and benefits of MCI products relative to the products the prosepct currently used. Future chapters will fully discuss questioning techniques to use during your presentation.

### Remember the Trial Close
* In planning your presentation, it is important to predetermine when and what feedback producing questions to ask. Remember to use the trial close as part of your SELL Sequence, as discussed in Chapter 3. The use of a question after discussing a benefit is a great method of obtaining feedback. Another way to create positive feedback is through empathy.

## Empathy Puts You in Your Customer's Shoes
* **Empathy** is the ability to identify and understand the other person's feelings, ideas, and situation. As a salesperson, you need to be interested in what the buyer is saying--not just in giving a sales presentation. Many of the barriers to communication mentioned earlier can be overcome when you place yourself in the buyer's shoes. Empathy is saying to a prospect, "I'm here to help you," or "Tell me your problems and needs so I can help you". Empathy is also evidenced by a salesperson's display of sincerity and intereset in the buyer's situation.
* This may mean acknowledging at times that a prospect may not need your product. Take, for example, the Scott Paper Company salesperson who finds that the customer still have 90 percent of the paper towels purchased three months ago. There is no reason to sell this customer more paper towels. It is time to help the customer sell the paper towels now on hand by suggesting displays, price reductions, and formats for newspaper advertisement. it is always wise to adopt your customer's point of view to meet the customer's needs best.

Do you Have Any of These Listening Habits
* No one is perfect. We all have some bad listening habits that we get away with when we talk to our family and friends. In a business context, however, leave these bad habits behind and practice active listening. To gain insight into your listening habits, read through this list of common irritating listening habits and be honest with yourself; notice what you are guilty of and use this awareness to begin eliminating them:

        1. You do all the talking
        2. You interrupt when people talk
        3. You never look at the person talking or indicate that you are listening
        4. You start argue before the other person has a chance to finish.
        5. Everything that is said reminds you of an experience you've had, and you feel obligated to digress with a story
        6. You finish sentences for people if they pause too long
        7. You wait impatiently for people to finish so that you can interject something
        8. You work too hard at maintaining eye contact and make people uncomfortable.
        9. You look as if you are appraising the person talking to you, looking him or her up and down as if considering the person for a modeling job
        10. You overdo the feedback you give--too many nods of your head and "uh-huh's".

## Keep It Simple
* The new salesperson was sitting in a customer's office waiting for the buyer. his boss was with him. As they heard the buyer come into the office, the sales manager said, "Remember, a KISS for him". No, he was not saying to give the buyera kiss, but to use the old selling philosophy of keep it simple, salesperson.
* The story is told of a little old lady who went into a hardware store. The clerk greeted her and offered her some help. She replied that she was looking for a heater. So the clerk said, "Gee, are you lucky! We have a big sale on these heaters, and a tremendous selection. Let me show you" So after maybe 30 or 45 minutes of discussiing duothermic controls, heat induction, and all the factors involved with how a heater operates, including the features and advantages of each of the 12 models, he turned to the little old lady and said, "Now, do you have any questions" To which she replied, "Yes, just one, Sonny. Which one of these things will keep a little old lady warm?"
* An overly complex, technical presentation should be avoided when it is unnecessary. Use words and materials that the buyer can understand easily. The skilled salesperson can make a prospect feel comfortable with a new product or complex technology through the subtle use of nontechnical information and a respectful attitude.
* Three literary masterpieces, the Lod's Prayer, The Twenty-Third Psalm, and Mr. Lincoln's Gettysbury Address, had few words and no long ones. Recall their phraseology:

        * Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name
        * The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want
        * Four score and seven years ago

* Not a single three-syllable word; hardly any two-syllable words. All of the great things in human life are one-syllable things--love, home, child, wife, trust, faith. As part of your study, watch television, listen to the radio, and read magazine advertisements. All of the great advertisements, generally speaking, use simple, small words. So keep it simple--KISS

## Creating Mutual Trust Develops Friendship
* Salespeople who develop a mutual, trusting relationship with their customers can not help being successful. This type of relationship eventually results in high source credibility and even friendship.
* If a buyer realizes that in the past she was sold products that performed to expectations, the products were worth their price, and the salesperson did everything promsied, she will trust the salesperson in the future. Building mutual trust is important to effective long-run communication.

## Listening Clues You In
* **Hearing** refers to being able to deetct sounds. **Listening** is deriving meaning from sounds that are heard. Everything you hear is not worth your undivided attention; for the salesperson, however, listening is a commuunication skill critical to success.
* Salespeople often believe that their job is to talk rather than to listen. If they both talk and listen, their persuasive powers increase. Since people can listen (about 400 words per minute) roughly twice as fast as the average rate of speech, it is understandable that a person's mind may wander while listening to a salesperson's presentation or that the salesperson may tune out a prospect. To keep the buyer listening, ask questions, get the buyer involved in the conversation, and show visual aids. Once you ask a question, carefully listen to the response.

#### Listen to Words, Feelings, and Thoughts
* This may seem obvious, but when someone speaks to you, the person is expressing thoughts and feelings. Despite the logic of this statement, most of us listen only to the words. Spoken language is an inexact form of communication, but it is the best we have in this stage of human evolution. If you come back 2,000 years from now, perhaps you will communicate with your prospects via mental telepathy. For now, given the limitation of words, look beyond them to hear the entire story.
* Listen behind the words for the emotional content of the message. This is conveyed in the nuances of voice and body language. Some people, such as sensers (discussed in Chapter 3), give you little emotional information. That's all right, because you deal with them in a factual, business-only style. Feelers, on the other hand, reveal their emotions, and in turn, they appreciate your acknowledgement of their feelings. It is appropriate to discuss their feelings and treat them more as friends than as strict busienss associates.
* You can hear the emotion behind the words in several ways. First, look for changes in eye contact. After establishing a comfortable and natural level of eye contact, and sudden deviations from the norm tip you off to emotional content in the message. People tend to look away from you when they talk about something embarrassing. When this happens, make a quick mental note of what it pertained to and treat the subject delicately. Also, give a person the courtesy of looking away momentarily yourself--as if you are saying, "I respect your privacy".
* Listen between the words for what is not said. Some people reveal more in what they don't say. Part of this is due to the emotional content of the message and part is due to the information they give you. A story illustrates this point.
* A salesperson was talking to the president of a large paper mill. "I simply asked him what kind of training he had for his salespeople. He went into a long discourse on all the seminars, training films, videotapes, and cassettes they had from the parent company, suppliers, industry associations, and in-house programs. I sad, listening, and took notes. At the end of his speech I said to him, 'I notice you didn't mention anything about time management for salespeople' He raise his voice and emphatically said, 'You know, just this morning I was talking to a guy and I told him we have to have some time-management training for our salespeople'''
* The lesson here is to get the prospect talking and listening actively--concentrate. Take notes, look for clues to emotions, and don't interrupte or start thinking about your next question.
