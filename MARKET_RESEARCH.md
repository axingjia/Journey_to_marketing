# Chapter 1: Introfduction to Marketing Research

## Quirk's Market Research Media: Welcome to the World of Marketing Research
* I started at Quirk's just about the time the Internet started changing all of our lives forever and it has been fascinating to seethe marketign research industry react and adapt to all things online. Once traditional in-person focus groups and telephone and mail-based surveys were the gold standards. At first, the hue and cry was all about the Web-based methods' lack of statistical validity. While wrestleing with that issue, the industry also struggled mightily to adopt old-style paper-and-pencil-based approaches to the digital age.
* But one look at the array of tools available to researchers today will show you that the struggle was worth it. Thanks to the smartphone, myriad forms of in-the-moment research are now possible, from mobile ethnography to location-based surveys, giving marketers and researchers access to new and different types of insights. 
* Despite the outside impressino of researchers as rule-folloing introverts, obsessed with getting the numbers to line up just so, the industry is full of smart, creative, and innovative people. So while big data and do-it-yourself research tools loom as two formidable threats to the traditional marketing reseracher's job, the same adaptable, entrepreneurial spirit that enabled the transition from the pre-Internet days to the smartphone era will help current and future research professionals to keep delivering the insights to drive their organizations' strategic decisions.

### About Quirk's
* In the decades before he founded and began publishing Quirk's Marketing Research Review in 1986, Tom Quirk worked on all sides on the marketing research process as a corporate or client-side researcher and later as a research company executive. A firm beliver in the merits of marketing research, he found himself regularly having to educate potential users of marketing research services on the value of investigating consumer wants, needs, and opinions and the various techniques that could be used to do so. Ever the entrepreneur, and seeing the need for a publication that would promote the use, understanding, and value of marketing research across all industries, he created Quirk's Marketing Research Review, a monthly trade magazine for marketing research clients and the vendors that partner with them.
* Armed with a newly minted B.A. in journalism from the university of Minnesota, I inteviewed with Tom in the summer of 1988 to become the magazine's second-ever editor-in-chief. I was impressed by his enthusiasm for marketing research and, perhaps more importantly, by his insistence that the articles in Quirk's, while generally aiming to promote the value of research, should be as objective, informative, and practical as possible. His aim was to show the many ways marketing research could be used and to give readers real-world, concrete examples of how the methods could be applied.
* In the nearly 30 years since then, the staff and I have used Tom's words as a guide. From its beginnings as a monthly magazine, Quirk's Media now offers a feature-packed webiste and curates and produces marketing research-related content in a variety of forms, from e-news-letters to blogs and Webinars--all free of charge to qualified marketing research and insights professionals.

* Events in recent years have brought many changes to the world of business. As joe Rydholm points out, these changes have profoundly influenced the marketing research industry. These are exciting times in marketing research! Globalization has added real meaning to the phrase "the business world". Digital and other technological innovations have allowed us to realize the promises of the "information age" in a few short years. New technologies continue to change the competitive landscape with much greater frequency than ever before. Digital media have expanded at unprecedented rates. Widespread adoption of mobile devices and apps provides consumers with information 24 hours a day. Many objects used by people collect and send information on an ongoing basis, creating the Internet of Things (IoT). Significantly, consumers have the power, through these online innovations, to create their own information, developing consumer-generated feedback in real time.
* def: Marketing research provides managers with new information to help them make decisions.
* This new era of big data and digital media not only challenges managers to keep pace but also to understand and respond to a changing world economy. Entire countries grapple with solvency. Political revolution has changed much of the world, and continued unrest threatens more change. Businesses must anticipate what these changes will mean for their markets and capitalize on economic growth where it is occurring. Managers must determine what products to make or what services to offer, which methods of advertising are most effective, which prices will help their firm realize its target return of investment (ROI), and which distribution systemn will add the greates value to the supply chain.
* This is where marketing research becomes important. Marketing research is the process of gathering information to make better decisions. This book will help you learn the process of marketing research so that you will better understand how to use marketing research to develop actionable insights as you aim to manage in a world of unprecedented change.

## 1-1 Marketing Research is Part of Marketing
* To fully appreciate the role of marketing research, it is helpful to understand its role in and relationship to marketing. What is marketing? A short definition is "meeting needs profitably". When Apple designed the iPad, it met a growing need among those seeking greater computer portability in a table format. Amazon has been successful in creating the first generation of online book readers with its Kindle tablets.
* The Amercian Marketing Assocation offers a more detailed definition:

        Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

* Over recent years marketing thought has evolved to a service-centered view that a) identifies core competencies, b) identifies potential customers who can benefit from these core competencies, c) cultivates relationships with ese customers by creating value that meets their specific needs, and d) collect feedback from the market, learn from the feedback, and improves the values offered to the public. Note that this view of marketing implies that firms must be more than customer oriented (making and selling what firms think customers want and need). In addition, they must collaborate with and learn from customers, adapting to their changing needs. A second implication is that firms do no view products as separate from services. "Is General Motors really marketing a service, which just happens to include a by-product called a car?"
