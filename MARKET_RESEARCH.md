# Chapter 1: Introfduction to Marketing Research

## Quirk's Market Research Media: Welcome to the World of Marketing Research
* I started at Quirk's just about the time the Internet started changing all of our lives forever and it has been fascinating to seethe marketign research industry react and adapt to all things online. Once traditional in-person focus groups and telephone and mail-based surveys were the gold standards. At first, the hue and cry was all about the Web-based methods' lack of statistical validity. While wrestleing with that issue, the industry also struggled mightily to adopt old-style paper-and-pencil-based approaches to the digital age.
* But one look at the array of tools available to researchers today will show you that the struggle was worth it. Thanks to the smartphone, myriad forms of in-the-moment research are now possible, from mobile ethnography to location-based surveys, giving marketers and researchers access to new and different types of insights. 
* Despite the outside impressino of researchers as rule-folloing introverts, obsessed with getting the numbers to line up just so, the industry is full of smart, creative, and innovative people. So while big data and do-it-yourself research tools loom as two formidable threats to the traditional marketing reseracher's job, the same adaptable, entrepreneurial spirit that enabled the transition from the pre-Internet days to the smartphone era will help current and future research professionals to keep delivering the insights to drive their organizations' strategic decisions.

### About Quirk's
* In the decades before he founded and began publishing Quirk's Marketing Research Review in 1986, Tom Quirk worked on all sides on the marketing research process as a corporate or client-side researcher and later as a research company executive. A firm beliver in the merits of marketing research, he found himself regularly having to educate potential users of marketing research services on the value of investigating consumer wants, needs, and opinions and the various techniques that could be used to do so. Ever the entrepreneur, and seeing the need for a publication that would promote the use, understanding, and value of marketing research across all industries, he created Quirk's Marketing Research Review, a monthly trade magazine for marketing research clients and the vendors that partner with them.
* Armed with a newly minted B.A. in journalism from the university of Minnesota, I inteviewed with Tom in the summer of 1988 to become the magazine's second-ever editor-in-chief. I was impressed by his enthusiasm for marketing research and, perhaps more importantly, by his insistence that the articles in Quirk's, while generally aiming to promote the value of research, should be as objective, informative, and practical as possible. His aim was to show the many ways marketing research could be used and to give readers real-world, concrete examples of how the methods could be applied.
* In the nearly 30 years since then, the staff and I have used Tom's words as a guide. From its beginnings as a monthly magazine, Quirk's Media now offers a feature-packed webiste and curates and produces marketing research-related content in a variety of forms, from e-news-letters to blogs and Webinars--all free of charge to qualified marketing research and insights professionals.

* Events in recent years have brought many changes to the world of business. As joe Rydholm points out, these changes have profoundly influenced the marketing research industry. These are exciting times in marketing research! Globalization has added real meaning to the phrase "the business world". Digital and other technological innovations have allowed us to realize the promises of the "information age" in a few short years. New technologies continue to change the competitive landscape with much greater frequency than ever before. Digital media have expanded at unprecedented rates. Widespread adoption of mobile devices and apps provides consumers with information 24 hours a day. Many objects used by people collect and send information on an ongoing basis, creating the Internet of Things (IoT). Significantly, consumers have the power, through these online innovations, to create their own information, developing consumer-generated feedback in real time.
* def: Marketing research provides managers with new information to help them make decisions.
* This new era of big data and digital media not only challenges managers to keep pace but also to understand and respond to a changing world economy. Entire countries grapple with solvency. Political revolution has changed much of the world, and continued unrest threatens more change. Businesses must anticipate what these changes will mean for their markets and capitalize on economic growth where it is occurring. Managers must determine what products to make or what services to offer, which methods of advertising are most effective, which prices will help their firm realize its target return of investment (ROI), and which distribution systemn will add the greates value to the supply chain.
* This is where marketing research becomes important. Marketing research is the process of gathering information to make better decisions. This book will help you learn the process of marketing research so that you will better understand how to use marketing research to develop actionable insights as you aim to manage in a world of unprecedented change.

## 1-1 Marketing Research is Part of Marketing
* To fully appreciate the role of marketing research, it is helpful to understand its role in and relationship to marketing. What is marketing? A short definition is "meeting needs profitably". When Apple designed the iPad, it met a growing need among those seeking greater computer portability in a table format. Amazon has been successful in creating the first generation of online book readers with its Kindle tablets.
* The Amercian Marketing Assocation offers a more detailed definition:

        Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

* Over recent years marketing thought has evolved to a service-centered view that a) identifies core competencies, b) identifies potential customers who can benefit from these core competencies, c) cultivates relationships with ese customers by creating value that meets their specific needs, and d) collect feedback from the market, learn from the feedback, and improves the values offered to the public. Note that this view of marketing implies that firms must be more than customer oriented (making and selling what firms think customers want and need). In addition, they must collaborate with and learn from customers, adapting to their changing needs. A second implication is that firms do no view products as separate from services. "Is General Motors really marketing a service, which just happens to include a by-product called a car?"
* our objective here is not to discuss how marketing thought is evolving but to emphasize a crucial point: To practice marketing, marketing decision makers need to make decisions. What are our core competencies? How can we use these core competencies to create value for our consumers? Who are our consumers and how can we collaborate with them? Managers have always needed information to make better decisions. In our opinion, to practice marketing well in today's environment requires access to more and better information. As you will learn, marketing research provides information to decision makers.
* The diffusion of digital media has created a culture that nurtures consumer collaboration. One important collaboration method is crowdsourcing. **Crowdsourcing** is the practice of obtaining services or ideas by asking for assistance from a large group of people, genreally online communities. Crowdsourcing via digital media is one of many tools for marketing research. 
* When firms make the right decisions, they produce products and services that their target markets perceive as having value. That value translates inso sales, profits, and a positive ROI. However, we see many failures in the marketplace. Consultants John Schneider and Julie hall state that they regularly hear from entrepreneurs and brand managers who beleive they have come up with a revolutionary product. But Schneider and hall state that these entrepreneurs almost never have done the research to confirm their grand expections. As an example, the firm CellZones thought it had the answer to cell phone privacy in libraries, restaurants and so on by creating soundproof boots for private cell phone use. Had the company done the right research and noticed that people were using their new smartphones to text rather than talk, managers may have realize that talking in private waas not a pressing need for consumers.
* In many examples of failed products and services, managers could have avoided the associated losses if they have conducted proper marketing research. Many product extensions--include McPizza, Colgate food entrees. BIC underwear, Coors spring water, and Harley Davidson perfume. Negative reactions from consumers were responsible for removing the Ken doll's earring and take Burger King Satisfires off the market. Could these failures have been avoided with better research information.

## THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MARKETIN CONCEPT GUIDES MANAGERS' DECISIONS
* A philosophy may be thought of as a system of values or principles by which you live. Your values or principles are important because they dictate what you do each day. This is why philosophies are so important; your philosophy affects your day-to-day decisions. For example, you may provide the knowledge and understanding I will need in the world to enable me to enjoy the standard of living I desire. Assuming this does reflect your philosophy regarding higher education, consider what you do from day to day. you are going to class, listening to your professors, taking notes, reading this book, and preparing for tests. If you did not share the philosophy we just described, you would likely be doing something entirely different.
* The same connection between philosophy and action holds true for business managers. One of the most important philosophies managers have is that which determines how they view their company's role in terms of what it provides the market. Some managers have a philosophy that "we make and sell product X'. A quick review of marketing industry will tell us this philosohpy is known as product orientation. Another philosophy, known as sales orientation, is illustrated by the following statement: "To be successful we must set high sales quotas, and sell, sell, sell!" Managers who guide their companies by either of these philosohpy may guide them right out of business. A much more effective philosohpy--the marketing concept--is defined here by prominent marketing professor Philip Kotler:

                * The **marketing concpet** is a business philosohpy that holds that the key to achieving organizational goals consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating customer value to its chosen target markets.
                * For many years, business leaders have recognized that this is the "right" philosophy. Although the term marketing concept is often used interchangeeably with other terms, such as "customer orientation" or "market-driven" the key point is that this philosophy puts the consumer first.
                * What does all this mean? It means that having the right philosohpy is an important first step in being successful. However, appreciatring the importance of satisfying consumer watns and needs is not enough. Firms must also put toegether the "right" strategy.

## THE "RIGHT" MARKETING STRATEGY
* Strategy is another name of planning. Firms have strategies in many areas other than marketing. Financial strategy, production strategy, and technology strategy, for example, may be key components of a firm's overall strategic plan. Here, we focus on marketing strategy. How do we define marketing strategy?

                * A **marketing strategy** consists of selecting a segment of the market as the company's target market and designing the proper "mix" of products/service, price, promotion, and distribution system to meet the wants and needs of the consumers within the target market.

* **Because we have adopted the marketing concept, we can not compe up with just any strategy. We have to develop the "right" strategy--the strategy that allows our firms to truly meet the wants and needs of the consumers within the market segment we have chosen. Think of the many questions we now must answer. What is the market, and how do we segment it? What are the wants and needs of each segment, and what is the size of each segment? Who are our competitors, and how are they already meeting the wants and needs of consumers? Which is the best price? Which promotional method will be the most efficient? how should we distribute the product/service? All these questions msut be answered to develop the "right" strategy.** To make the right decisions, managers must have objective, accurate, and timely information.
* It is equally important to understand that today's strategy may be work tomorrow because, as we noted at the beginning of this chapter, there is unprecedented change going on in the buiness environment. What new strategies will be needed in tomorrow's world? As environment chnage, business decisions must be revised on an ongoing basis to produce the right strategy for the new environment.
* To practice marketing, to implement the marketing concept, and to make the decisions necessary to create the right marketing strategy, managers need information. Now you should see how marketing research is part of marketing; marketing research supplies managers with the information to help them make better decisions.

## 1-2 What is Marketing Research
* now that we have established the managers need information to carry out the marketing process, we need to define marketing research.

                * Marketing research is the process of designing, gathering, analyzing, and reporting information that may be used to solve a specific marketing problem.

* Thus, marketing research is defined as a process that reports information that can be used to solve a marketing problem, **such as determining price or identifying the most effective advertising media. The focus then is on a process that results in information that will be used to make decisions.** Notice also that our definition refers to information that may be used to solve a specific marketing problem. We will undercore the importance of specificity later in this chapter. Ours is not the only definition of marketing research. The American Marketing Association (AMA) formed a committee several years ago to establish a definition of marketing research:

                * Marketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer, and public to the marketer through information--informaiton used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems; generate, refine, and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; and improve the understanding of marketing as a process.

* Eahc of these definition is correct. Our definition is shorter and illustrate the process ofmarketing research. The AMA's definition is longer because it elaborates on the function as well as the uses of marketing research. In following sections, we will talk more about the function and uses of marketing research.

## IS IT MARKETING RESEARCH OR MARKET RESEARCH?
* Some people differentitate between marketing research and market research. Marketing research is defined the way we and the AMA have defined it in previous paragraphs. In fact, the Marketing Research Association (MRA defines t his term similarly as a process used by business to collect, analyze, and interpret informaiton used to make sound business decisions and successfully manage the business. **In comparison, some define market research as a subset of marketing research, using this term to refer to applying marketing research to a specific market area.** The MRA defines market reserach as a process used to define the size, location, and/or makeup of the market for a product or service. Having made this distinction, we recognize that many practitioners, publications, organizations, serving the industry, and academics use the two terms interchangeably.

## THE FUNCITON OF MARKETING RESEARCH
* The AMA definition states that the funciton of marketing research is to link the consumer to the marketer by providing information that can be used in making marketing decisions. Note that the AMA definition distinguishes between consumers and customers. The committee intended this differentiation between retail (or B2C) consumers and business (or B2B) customers. Some believe that having the link to the consumer by marketing reserach is more important today than ever. having that link with consumers is crucial if fimrs are to provide them with the value they expect in the marketplace. Thanks to globalization, online shopping, and social media, consumers today have more choices, more information, and more power to speak to others in the market than ever before.

## 1-3 What Are the Use of Marketing Research
* The AMA definition also spells out the different uses of marketing research. The three uses are 1) identifying market opportunities and problems, 2) generating, refining, and evaluating potential market actions, and 3) monitoring marketing performance. We explain each of these further in the following sections.

## IDENTIFYING MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND PROBLMS
The first of these uses is the identification of market opportunities and problems. It is not easy to determine what opportunities are in the market. Although we can think of new product or service ideas, which ones are actually feasible? Which ideas can we accomplish, and which will mostly likely generate a good ROI? Often, after someone has found an opportunity by creating a highly successful product or service, managers ask, "Why didn't we see that opportunity?" Some marketing research studies are designed to find out what consumers' problems are and to assess the suitability of different proposed methods of resolving those problems. High gasoline prices and concerns about fossil emissions bothered consumers, so Toyota developed the Prius. Consumers wanted increasingly large TV screens to hang on their walls, so Samsung developed an ultra-thin, LED, large-screen TV, Consumers who did not have cable wanted to be able to buy HBO, so HBO develoepd HBO show.
* You would think that managers would alyways know what their problems are. Why would problem identification be a use of marketing research? Problems are not always easy to identify. **Managers are more likely to always know the symptoms (sales are down, market share is falling), but determining the cause of the symptoms sometimes requires research. The identifcaiton of opportunities and problems is discussed in Chapter 3.**

## GENERATING, REFINING, AND EVALUATING POTENTIAL MARKETING ACTIONS
* Marketing research can also be used t o generate, refine, and evaluate a potential marketing action. Here "actions" may be thought of as strategies, campaigns, programs, or tactics. General Mills acquired Annie's Homegrown, an organic food company, in 2014 to meet a growing demand by consumers to have access to organic and natural foods. **"Action" of General Mills included generating the basic strategy to meet consumers' growing desire for organic foods, refining the Annie's brand by identifying ways to promote Annie's established products and develop new product that are consistent with teh brand culture, and evaluating plans to market and grow the Annie's brand.** Management can use marketing research to make better decisions for any and all of these actions.
