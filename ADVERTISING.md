# Chapter 1: Integrated Marketing Commmunications
* As the opening vignette illustrates, companies use advertising, websites, direct marketing, sales, promotion, public relations, and social media to communicat something about their products, prices, or availability. In fact, finding the right combination of marketing communication tools is a critical decision for small and large firms, private and public organizations, and those that market goods, services, or ideas. In response, many companies use integrated marketing communications to link or connect their promotional tools and communicate with their current and prospective customers. Companies develop their marketing communication plans such that each promotional tool retains its unique communication effect and that the combination of promotional tools contributes to the overall communication effect of the brand or organization.
* This opening chapter sets the direction for the entire book as it highlights the marketing context for advertising and promotion. First, it describes the importance of marketing communication. It then briefly defines the different promotional or marketing communication tools available for marketers. Next, it illustrates the idea of integrated marketing communications and indicates why it is so important. Finally, it explains the content of an integrated marketing communication (IMC) plan as a way of orienting the perspective and organization of this text.

## Marketing Communication
* In this opening section we describe the importance of marketing communication within an organization's overall marketing effort. We begin by reviewing the definition of marketing to understand the importance of marketing communication to deliver value to consumers. We then explore examples of the content of marketing communication plans to illustrate their many different purposes.

### Marketing
* Historically, the American Marketing Association (AMA), the organization that represents marketing professionals in the United States and Canada, defined marketing as **the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational objectives.** This definition focused on exchange as a central concept in marketing and the use of key marketing activities to create and sustain relationships with customers. **For exchange to occur there must be two or more parties with something of value to one another, a desire and ability to give up that something to the other party, and a way to communicate with each other. Marketing communication plays an important role in the exchange process by informing consumers of an organization's product and convinging them of its ability to satisfy their needs or wants. 
* The marketing function in an organization facilitates the exchange process by examining the needs and wants of consumers, developing a product or service that satisfy these needs, offering it at a certain price, making it available at a particular place or through a channel of distribution, and developing a program of promotion or marketing communication. These four P--product, price, place (distribution), and promotion (marketing communication)--are elements of the **marketing mix**. The main purpose of the marketing function is to combine these four elements into a marketing program that facilitates the potential for exchange with consumers in the marketplace. The remainder of this section describes how the marketing mix decisions of product, price, and distribution (Figure 1-1) are often the primary content of marketing communication messages.

        Product Decision: Product Type, Features and Attributes/Benefits, Corporate Name/Identification, Brand name, Identification, Package Design

        Price Decision: Price Level, Price Policy, Discount, Allowance, Flexibility

        Distribution Decision: Channel Type, Channel Policy, Type of Intermeediary or Reseller, Type of Location/Store, Service Level

### Communication Product
* Each of the product facets listed in Figure 1-1 can be the focus of marketing communication. This section shows **how marketing messages can communicate the value of the product type, the importance of salient attributes or benefits, and the identity of the brand or organization, in order to assist with brand equity development.**

* **Product Value** An organization exists because it offers a product to consumers, generally in exchange for money. This offering may come in the form of a physical good (such as a soft drink, pair of jeans, or car), a service (banking, air travel, or legal assistance), a cause (United Way, March of Dimes), and idea (don't think and drive), or even a person (political candidate). **The product is anything that can be marketed and that, when consumed or supported, gives satisfaction to the individual.** And these different product types are not always independent. When eating at a restaurant, consuemrs enjoy the food itself but also value the service of not having to prepare the meal, or the opportunity to eat food they may not have the culinary skill to make. Thus, whatever the product type, marketing communication attempts to show how consuemrs can receive value through the product offering.

* **Product Attributes/Benefits** Every product has fairly obvious features or attributes that characterize what it is. A chocolate bar can have varying types of chocolate (e.g., milk, dark) and different kinds of ingredients (e.g., nuts, wafers). Thus, marketing commmunication can take the simple role of identifying the ingredients or composition of a good. For example, ads for Rice krispies cereal reminded consumers that each "krisp contained a single grain of rice, while ads for Shreddies cereal highlighted its unique diamond shape. Notice how the ESQ ad in Exhibit 1-2 highlighted attributes of the watch regarding the watch face and functions. Moreover, organizations often use marketing commmunication to educate consumers on how the services are delivered. For instance, WestJet ads demonstrate the personal attentiveness the airline's staff provide to customers, while Keg Steakhouse ads focus on the ambiance of the restaurant as well as the food.
* Consumers typically view a product as a bundle of benefits signifying what the attributes can do. Benefits can be functional (the performance of the product), experimental (what it feels like to use the product), and/or psychological (self-esteem or status that result from owning a particular brand). Advertising and other marketing communication tools draw attention toward these benfits. Managers often have to decide which benefits to emphasize or how to portray the benefits in a message, and the best way to deliver that message. BMW's latest advertising emphasizes t he joy of driving a BMW vehicle (i.e., experiential benefit) by showing an "expression of joy". One print ad did not show th product, but rather depcited the car's tire marks in colour as if they were painted unpon canvas.
* *Product symbolism* refers to what a product or brand means to consumers and what they experience in purchasing and using it. For products with strong symbolic features, the social meaning of the experiential or psychological benefits may be more important that function utility. For example, designer clothing such as Versace, Gucci, and Prada is often purchased on the basis of its symbolic meaning. Marketing communication plays an important role in developing and maintaining the symoblism of these brands.
* **Brand Identity** A brand or corporate name and its identification through its logo, symbol, or trademark represent critical product decisions. Marketers use brand names that can communicate product concepts clearly, such as Air Canada and Seadoo (water craft). The importance of selecting an appropriate visual representation of the brand is clear by noticing the symbol of any automobile brand or company. **One primary purpose of marketing communication is to present the brand and its identification in favourable locations, situations, or time frames that allow consumers to think or feel more positively toward the brand. The identification of a logo in an ad is critical, as evidenced by a legal challenge Molson-Coors filed against Labatt in which the company suggested the stylized mountaintop shown in a Kokanee ad appeared too similar to the logo used by Coors Light.
* Brand identification and the symbolism of teh brand are often reinforced by the tagline or slogan appearing in any form of marketing communication. IKEA's latest slogan encapsulates the essence of the brand magnificently with "Any space can be beautiful". Some executives suggest that the tagline is still very relevant since it "communicates a brand position or brand benefit". For example, Swiss Chalet returned to a previously successful tagline, "Always so good for so little", after making many changes the past few years. Harvey's has reminded us often over the years of the beauty of its hamburgers. Firms that offer many types of goods and services use an audio logo as one way of connecting brand messages across multiple media and IMC tools, much like a visual logo. For example, the Rogers audio logo can be heard for many of its services, including wireless and cable. Continuity and consistency in the promotional message across IMC tools--television, radio, wireless, interactive displays, Internet, podcasts--makes simple reminders of brand identification a key part of the brand experience.
* Packaging provides functional benefits such as economy, protection, and storage, which can be the main purpose of a marketing communication message. However, since the package is associated so closely with the brand by giving it a distinctive look, its symbolism and identity foten become the focal point of a marketing communication message. For example, the main point of an ad can be to show the packaging of the product, since this influences consumer choice as in the case of perfume. Other characteristics of packaging, like it being fully biodegradable, are a concern for marketers and have become the focal message for marekting communication.
* **Brand Equity** Finally, the culmination of marketing communication messages of product value, product attributes/benefits, and brand identification assists in creating and maintaingin brand equity. **Brand equity** is an intangible asset of added value or goodwill that results from the favourable image, impressions of differentiation, and/or strength of consumer attachment to a company name, brand name, or trademark. **Brand equity allows a brand to earn greater sales volume and/or higher margins than it could without the name, providing the comapny with a competitive advantage.** Conceptually, IMC planning and resulting decisiosn are expected to strongly generate brand equity. Figure 102 highlights the top 10 most valuable Canadian brands as determined by Brand Finance, while Figure 1-3 identifies the best Canadian brands as complied by Interbrand. From a related point of view, Ipsos Reid undertook research to uncover the most influential brand in Canada. President Choice attained the highest rand at number three with consumers saying the brand is relevant (38%), dependable (53%), and likeable in social media (24%).

### COMMUNICATION PRICE
* The price refers to what the consumer msut give up to purchase a product. Price is usually expressed in dollar amount exchanged for an item; however, **the true cost of a product to the consumer include time, mental activity, and behavioural effort. Price planning involves decisions concerning the level, policy, adjustments through discounts or allowances, and flexibility when facing competition. Moreover, it also signals the economic cost to consumers for all product benefits conmbined. Communicating price information is so critical that the federal government regulated airlines to advertise their full price that would include all fees and taxes.
* **Marketing communication plays a role in reinforcing a consumer's belief that the product's benfit or quality accurately reflects the price. One historical study regarding price, product quality, and advertising expenditures concluded that pricing and advertising strategies go together. High relative ad expenditures should accompany premium prices, and low relative ad expenditures should be tailored to low prices.
* Price is often a key message conveyed. For example, car dealership focus on price and discounts and allowances offered in many aspects of their marketing communication. **Internet ads focus on price or offers that attempt to influence consumer price beliefs. The information on websites offering deals is predominantly price related (e.g., redtag.ca). A main purpose of the price comparison adveritsing plays a key role in consumers' reference price for products when determining the value of a product. Other research finds that communicating price information is critical for influencing cconsumers who are in the process of deciding to buy a product.

### COMMUNICATING DISTRIBUTION
* Marketing channels, the "place" element of the marketing mix, are "sets of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption". Most consumer product companies distribute through **indirect channels**, usually using a network of wholesalers and/or retailers. A company can choose not to use any channel intermediaries and sell to its customers through **direct channels** such as the Internet.
* In either case, marketing communication often provides information as to where a product can be purchased. For example, since most sporting goods comapnies have different quality and price levels, they might be inclined to communicat which brands and models are at different types of retailers. Alternatively, different kinds or levels of service might be available in various locations of the distrbituion network and this could be the focus of marketing communication. For instanc,e particular locations for cosmetics products offer customized beautifying services, while others can be close to self-serve. Extensive marketing communication occurs in order to direct consumers to organizational websites for online purchases.

## The Promotional Mix
* **Promotion** is the coordination of all seller-initiated efforts to set up channels of information and persuasion to sell goods and services or promote the idea. While implicit communication occurs throught the other elements of the marketing mix, most of an organization's communication with the marketplace occurs as part of a carefully planned and controlled promotional program. The tools an organization uses in a promotional program are referred to as the **prmotional mix**. While either term is suitable, promotion or marketing communication, many marketers use the latter since the tools are often connected. For example, a television commercial can direct vieweres to a website. Or a brand may use the same type of message in its radio and print ads. We now define of each of the tools and summarize their purpose.

### ADVERTISING
* **Advertising** is defined as any paid form of nonpersonal communication about an organization, product, service, or idea by an identified sponsor. The paid aspect of this definition reflects the fact that the space or time for an advertising message generally must be bought. An occsaional exception to this is the public service announcement (PSA), whose advertising space or time is donated by the media.
* The *nonpersonal* component means advertising involves mass media (e.g., TV, radio, magazines, newspapers) that can transmit a message to large groups of individuals, often at the same time. The nonpersonal nature of advertising means there is generally no opportunity for immediate feedback from the message recipent (except in direct-response advertising). Therefore, before the message is sent, the advertiser must consider how the audience will interpret and respond to it.
* Canadian advertisers spend more than $14 billion annually to reach their audiences, and there are several reasons why advertising is such an important part of many marketers' prmotional mix.

**The Promotional Mix: Advertising, Direct marketing, Internet Marketing, Sales promotion, Public relation, Personal Selling**

* **Cost-Efficient** Advertising can be a very cost-efficient method for communicating with alrge audiences. For example, during a television season, prime-time network television reached 85 eprcent of Canadian on a daily basis. The most-watched TV show each week attracts an audience of about 3 million English-speaking viewers. The average top-10 show audience is about 2.4 million viewers, while the average audience for the top 11 to 20 shows is about 1.7 million viewers. One study quotes media experts who estimate the cost per thousand reached at $25 for a top show and $20 for a top 11-20 show. To reach an audience for Canadian-produced television shows cost $16 per thousand; specialty channel audiences cost $8 per thousand.
* **Cost-Effective** Assuming that a majority of the viewers actually watched a TV ad, paid attention during the airing, and remember something about the message, then advertising can be seen as a very cost-effective form of marketing communication for many brands. In general, advertising can be cost-effective method for allowing potential customers to know something about a brand and have a positive attitude toward the brand prior to, during, or after purchasing a product.
* **Brand Effects** Advertising is also a valuable tool for building company or brand equity as it is a powerful way to provide consumers with information as well as to influence their attitudes. **Advertising can be used to create favourable and unique images and association for a brand, which can be very important for companies selling products or services that are difficult to differentiate on the basis of functional attributes. Brand image and brand reputation play an important role in the purchase of many goods and services, and advertising remains a recommended approach to build a brand.
* **Brand Interaction** Increasingly, advertising in media such as television, print, and outdoor is employed to encourage consuemrs to interact with the brand online. For example, a Boil King campaign created the fictitious journalist Rob Liking, who interviewed people grilling on their barbeques. Executives identified research showing that consumers researched their purchase online prior to a store visit, thus leading to a primary objective of influencing consumers' behaviour in teh form of visiting the company's website.
* **Flexible Tool** Advertising is a flexible tool that can be used for many industries (e.g., cars or soft drinks), market situations (e.g., new product launch or market development for established product), channel members (e.g., consumers or retailers), and target audiences (e.g., new customers or loyal customers). For example, the new campaign for American Express tries to attract customers of other credit cards with its message, "Impossible? Nah. Does that sound like the service you get from your card?"
* **Multiple Domain** Different types of advertising occur in many domains. Canadian marketers of goods and services advertising to consumer markets with national or regional brand messages, and in some cases with messages to particular international consuemr markets. Alternatively, local retailers and other goods and services providers use advertising for many communication purposes in order to achieve sales objectives. Also, industry associations, like the Dairy Farmers of Canada, advertise extensively to consumer markets as do all levels of government and non-governmental organizations like Canadian Blood Services. Shoppers Drug Mart used advertising to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary with its largest media buy ever to support all of its marketing communication.
* Business-to-business advertising is directed to those who buy or influence the purchase of goods or services for their organization. Exhibit 1-7 shows an example of how General Electric communicates to other organizations that it competes in the solar energy market. Professional advertising directed to those with specific designations is found in many industries such as health, management, government, and technology. Finally, advertising directed to channel members like wholesaleers, distributors, and retailers is found in all industry sectors around the world.

### SALES PROMOTION
* **Sales promotion** is defined as marketing activities that provide extra value or incentives to the sales force, distributors, or the ultimate consumer and can influence their behaviour to stimulate sales. Sales promotion is generally broken into two major categories: consumer-oriented and trade-oriented activities.
* Consumer sales promotion is targeted to the ultimate user of a product or service and includes tools like coupons, samples, premiums, rebates, contests, events, and point-of-purchase materials. These promotional tools encourage consumers to make an immediate purchase, participate in a brand activity by attending the Red Bull Crashed Ice competition in Quebec City, or be more involved with the organization's marketing communication by uploading a video to a social media site celebrating one's consumption of a brand. Exhibit 1-8 is an example of a coupon offer within an ad that encourage parents to switch to a healthier snack for their children. Shoppers Drug Mart celebrates its anniversary with a contest offering 50 grand prices and attracted more than 900,000 entrants.
* Trade sales promotion is targeted toward marketing intermediaries such as wholesalers, distributors, and retailers. Promotional and merchandising allowances, price deals, sales contests, and trade shows are examples of teh promotional tools used to encourage the trade to stock and promote  a company's products. Some trade promotions benefit consumers since they receive information contained in display or receive discounted prices that are passed along to them from the retailer. Retail personnel at Shoppers Drug Mart liked the specialized point-of-purchase material so much they avoided dismantling it even after the party was over.

### PUBLIC RELATIONS
* Public relations (PR) occurs when an organization systematically plans and distribute information in an attempt to control and manage its image. **Public relations** is defined as "the management function which evaluates public attitudes, identifies the policies and procedures of an individual or organization with the public interest, and executes a program of action **to earn public understanding and acceptance**. Public relations uses a variety of tools--including special publications, participation in community activities, fundraising, sponsorship of special events, and public affair activities--to enhance an organization's image. **Many organizations make PR an integral part of their predetermined marketing and promotional strategies.** Exhibit 1-9 shows how sponsorship activities are part of a PR strategy. PR is now recognized as a communications tool that uses and supports adveritsing and sales promotion. For example, Cisco and the CBC, two key drivers of teh "One Million Acts of Green" program, recruited Time Hortons to their cause through the promotion of a 10-cent discount for each hot drink purchased and consumed with a reusable travel mug. Shoppers Drug Mart sponsored the Toronto Internation Film Festival and featured its imagery with the red carpet entry of the celebrities.
* **Publicity** refers to nonpersonal communications regarding an organization, product, service, or idea not directly paid for or run under identified sponsorship. The message reaches the public in the form of a news story, editoral or announcement. Like advertising, publicity invoels nonpersonal communication to a mass audience, but unlike advertising, publicity is not directly paid for by the organization. The organization encourages the media to cover or run a favourable story by using tools like news releases, press conferences, feature articles, and audio-visual media.
* An advantage of publicity over other forms of promotion is its credibility. Consumers generally tend to be less skeptical toward favourable information about a product or service example, the succes (or failure) of a new movie is often determine by the reviews it receives from film critics, who are viewed by many moviegoers as objective avaluators. Another advantage of publicity is its low cost, since the company is not paying for time or space in a mass medium. While an organization may incur costs in developing publicity items or maintaining a staff to do so, these expenses will be far less  than those for the other promotional programs.

### DIRECT MARKETING
* **Direct marketing** occurs when organizations communicate directly with target audiences to generate a response and/or a transaction. Direct marketing includes telemarketing and call centres, direct mail, mail-order catagues, and direct-response ads in broadcast and print media. Traditionallhy, direct marketing has not been considered a part of the promotional mix since it had distinct objectives, strategies, and tactics. However, we view direct marketing as an important component of a firm's marketing communication program since it is connected to many other communication tools. Extensive direct marekting activies also occur iwth the administration of loyalty programs designed to keep in touch with frequent purchase customers. Shoppers Drug Mart revamped its Optimum points program while celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, which translated into 20 percent growth in its membership.
* Direct-marketing tools are used by companies that distribute their products to consumers directly and by companies that distribute their products through traditional distribution channels  or their own sales force. In order to communicate directly, companies develop and maintain database containing contact information (e.g., address, phone number, email) of present and prospective customers. They use telemarketing to call customers directly and attempt to sell products and services or qualify them as sales leads. Call centres are used to respond to customer inquiries or concerns. Marketers also sent out direct-mail pieces ranging from simple letters and flyers to detailed brochures, catalogues, and DVDs to give potential customers information about their products or services. Direct-marketing techniques are also used to distribute product samples and other promotional items. In addition, marketers use **direct-response advertising**, wherebhy a product is promoted through an ad (e.g., television or print) that encourages the consumer to purchase directly from the manufacturer.

### INTERNET MARKETING
* We are currently experiencing a dynamic change in marketing through interactive media, delivered via the Internet. **Interactive media allow for a back-and-forth flow of information whereby users can participate in and modify the form and content of the information they receive instantly. Unlike traditional forms of marketing communication such as advertising, which are one-way in nature, these new media allow users to perform a variety of functions such as receiving and altering information and images, making inquiries, responding to questions, and, of course, making purchases. Shoppers Drug Mart attracted many new fans in social media and further developed its online luxury boutique Murale.
* Many website provide current and potential customers with informatio nabout the company's activities and products. Other firms develop websites to entertain or communicate more emotionally with their clientele. In fact, as part of a complete IMC program that included advertising, sales promotion, events, and public relations. BMW's Smart Car used Internet media with a dedicated microsite, a customized Facebook page, and Youtube to demonstrate the car's big interior despite it being small on the outside.
* As this example illustrate, the Internet is a medium that can be used t oexecute all the elements of the promotional mix. Inaddition to advertising on the Web, marketers offer sales promotion incentives such as coupons, contests, and sweepstakes online, and they use the Internet to conduct direct marketing, personal selling, and public relations activies more effectively and efficiently. For example, Exhibit 1-11 shows how consumers can interact with the naked juice brand on the Internet.
* Social media avenues like Facebook and Youtube are ways for marketers to reach consumers with print and video  ads, respectivel. Each also allows brand to establish groups (Facebook) or channels (Youtube) for all kinds of marketing commmunication activities such as simple ads and sophisticated sales promotions. With imagination and creativity, all aspects of marketing communication are adapted in these new opportunities. Moreover, the interactive features of new media allow for extended commmunication among members, thereby providing a powerful means of additional communication.
* Access to websites, social media, and other interactive experiences and their resulting marketing communication sponsorship (i.e., ads) has been made easier and more prevalent with the development of wireless mobile media devices. In essence, these smart portable devcies and their accompanying applications are opening the door for marketers to adapt and invent ways of implementing marketing communication. For example, while walking down the street a person could receive a message with an incentive to turn back and eat at a restaurant he jstu passed by.

### PERSONAL SELLING
* The final promotional mix element is **personal selling**,  aform of persona-to-person communication in which a seller assist and/or persuades prospective buyers to purchase the company's product or service or to act on an idea. Personal selling involves direct contact between buyer and seller, either face-to-face or through telecommunications. This interaction gives the marketer communication flexibility; the seller can see or hear the potential buyer's reactions and tailor the message to their specific needs or situation. We do not cover personal selling in this book as many decisions pertaining to this topic are the responsibiltiy of a sales manager.

### PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROMOTIONAL PROCESS
* Thus far we have identified the major promotional tools that marketers use. To understand the context in which promotional decisions are made, we identify the participants of the
