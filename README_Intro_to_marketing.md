# Preface

* The complexity of the decision faced by Canadian marketers in today's technology-intensive, hpyer competitive global business environment is both exciting and challenging.
* The main goal of this textbook is to help students develop the skills necessary to meet these challenges by immersing them in experience in marketing decision making.
* This textbook focuses on marketing decision making and the decision maker, not just on marketing theory, concepts, and principles.
* Student pratice making and supporting real marketing decisions and learn from decisions made by others--experienced and successful international marketers in a variety of industries, companies, and context.
* The text is more strategic in focus, introducing strategic marketing concepts such as the development of market-driven strategies, positioning strategies, and sources of sustainable competitive advantage. This allows students to fully apprecitate the strategic nature and implications of their decision
* At the same time, the text focuses on decision making by taking marketing managers' perspectives and showing students how core marketing concepts, theories, and principles are used to make key marketing decisions
* It contains an organizing framwork that illustrates how all of the decisions marketers make related to each other.
* Chapter 1 (what is marketing?) introduces an organizing framework that provides students with a summary of the **marketing planning** process. We have placed a greater focus on value creation through a more detailed discussion of value creation and by using value creation as a theme throughout the text 
* The discussion of SWOT analysis in Chapter 2 (Making **Strategic Marketing** Decisions) has been enhanced
* In Chapter 3 (**Market Segmentation and Positioning**), we have put greater focus on defending positioning strategies and on developing brand personality
* In Chapter 4 (**Market Research**), we have updated the section on marketing inteligence, including updated example. We have also provided a more comprehensive discussion of **customer satisfaction** measurement and expand the discussion of interactive and online **marketing research**
* In Chapter 5 (**Consumer Buying Behavior**), we have enhanced our discussion of **brand loyalty** and the **FCB grid**. We have updated our discussion of technology with a new section on blogs and **blogging** and RSS feeds
* In Chapter 6, (**Organizational Buying Behavior**), we have provided a new section on **Customer Relationship Management** and made our discussion of the use of technology in managing these relationship more current.
* In Chapter 7 (PRoduct Strategy), we have revised the discussion of the layers of the **product concept** to be consistent with the approach most instructors expect. A discussion of **product classifications** has been added to the chapter.
* In Chatper 8 (Product Management), we have added a new section on **service strategy**.
* In Chapter 9 (Pricing Strategy), we have streamlined the presentation of the material and made it easier to read by moving more of the marketing math concepts and examples to the Chapter Appendix
* In Chapter 10 (Channels and Supply Chain Strategy), we have enhanced our discussion of channel management with new section on **motivating channel partners**. 
* In Chapter 11 (**Retailing and E-tailing**), we have updated our discussion, facts, and figures relating to e-tailing and we have added a discussion of the marketing implications of social networking sites like Youtube, MySpace, and Facebook
* In Chapter 12 (**Integrated Marketing Communication**), we have added new sections discussing Characteristics of **IMC, Database Marketing, buzz marketing, guerilla marketing, event marketing, and viral marketing**.
* In Chatper 13 (**Commmunication Mix and Tactics**), we have expanded our discussion of **Internet advertising**, added a new section of **mobile marketing and SMS**, and added a new section on **Search Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization**. We have also added a discussion of technology to our treatment of **personal selling**
* In Chapter 14 (**Developing and Implementing a marketing Plan**), we have provided a much more detailed discussion of **marketing planning** and how to write a marketing plan. A new sample marketing plan that follows the prescribed marketing plan outline has been included in the appendix.

### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.

* [Def] Value refer to the benefit a customer receives from buying and using a good or service in relation to the costs and sacrifices of buying and using it
* You have "market value" as a person--you have qulities that set you apart from others and abilities other people want and need. After you finish this course, you'll have even more value because you'll know about the field of marketing and how the field relates to you as a future busienss person and a consumer. Although our main focus is understanding how to make effective marketing decisions for organizations, what you learn here equally applies to "brand you" -- and hopefully you will get some ideas about what you can do to increase your value to employers, partners, and maybe even to society. You probably already knew that celebrities like Sidney Crosby, Mike Meyers and Avril Lavigne are "brands"--but so is every one else. We "position" ourselves for job interviews; we are "on the market" when we break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend; some people hire image consultant to devise a "marketing strategy" for them; while others undergo plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their "product image". So, the principles of marketing apply to you, just as they apply to coffee, cars, computers, and produce. While there are some difference in how we go about marketing each of these, the basic ideas are the same. Marketing is a fundamental part of our lies both as consumers and as business people. 

##### THE WHO AND WHERE OF MARKETING
* This book is about marketing, and more specifically about making effective marketing decisions that create value for others. 
* Marketers come from many different places. Although many have earned marketing degrees, others have all sorts of background, sometimes with formal training and sometimes without. Fashion retailers may have training in design. Advertising creative executives often have a fine arts background while copywriters often have degrees in English. E-marketer who design interactive webpages for products and companies may have studies computer science. Even accountants often end up in marketing roles, as someone needs to make marketing decisions for accounting firms.
* Marketers work in a variety of location. They work in consumer goods companies such as Mega Bloks or Black & Decker or at service companies, or the Bank of Montreal. You will see them in retail organizatinos like lululemon atheletica or Frontrunners and at companies that manufacture products for other companies like Bombardier or Nortel. You will see them in government organizations like the Canadian Tourism Commission, not-for-profit organizations like the Candian Cancer Society, large organizations like IBM Canada, and small startup like TeamPage, a website for intramural and other amateur sport teams to coordinate and communicate their activities. Sport and the arts are hotbeds of activity for marketing. A big part of these efforts involves promoting athletes like Sidney Crosby and artist like Avril Lavigne--who themselves create customer experiences
* Marketing principles are organizations work hard to convince consumers to use seat belts, engage in safe sex, not litter, not smoke, and not drink and drive. 
* No matter where they work, all marketers are real people who make decisions that affect themselves, their companies, and very often thousands if not millions of consumers or customers
* It is important to recognize that the marketing decision maker may not have made the most appropriate decision. In fact, there are no "right answers" in business and, ultimately, consumers are the only judges of whether we, as marketers, have made good decisions. What you want to practice is making and defending your decision based on appropriate analysis, application of marketing theory, concepts, and principles, and your judgment. Do not worry if you think that you might not have good judgment yet. That comes with experience and practice in making marketing decision.
* [def] The official definition of marketing adopted in 2004 by the American Marketing Association is: **marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholder**. The basic idea of this somwhat complicated definition of marketing is that marketing is all about creating and delivering value, and doing this for all parties involved in an exchange. This involves a decision-making process, and these decisions are typically (but not always) made by people who have official marketing roles in areas of an organization such as marketing department, a sales department, a marketing communications department, or a new product development department. Another definition of marketing is: **marketing is the process of achieving individual and organizational objectives by creating superior customer value for one or more target market with a sustainable strategy.** This definition suggests that "the prime directive" of marketing is to achieve objectives. **We do that by creating superior customer value--creating offers that are perceived as being more valuable to customers than any other solutions (competing brands), or even more valuable than the money in their wallet**. [def] **Customer value** is what you get from buying and using a product relative to the costs and sacrifices you incur to do so. **To create a transaction or an economic exchange of value, both parties need to believe that the exchange is fair--that what they get is worth more to them than what they give up.** Of course each of us has our own perceptions of how to best satisfy our needs, what is valuable, and what exchanges are "worth it". One enterprising entrepreneur in England recently offered deluxe 61-step car washes for $10,000. Enough customers thought the two-week process was worth it thathe has nine months' worth of business lined up. **The challenge to the marketer is to create, price, distribute, and communicate an attrative value proposition to the customer to get the most value in return**. (EX: Pepsi-cola hopes that the product, price, distribution, and communication decisions it makes for Aquafina result in a value proposition preferred by customers). This alternative definition also focuses on the idea of creating value for specific target markets, groups of people that have different needs, wants, or preferences from other groups of people and would seek a different value proposition(solution). Not everyone would want a $10,000 car wash, but apprently some people (sheiks and billionaires) do. This definition also suggests that we want to **develop a sustainable strategy**, not in the environmental sense, but in the sense of making a set of decision that will allow us to compete effectively until our objectives have been achieved--which ofr most organizations is a long term perspective

### Marketing is About Creating Customer Value
* One important part of our definition of marketing is taht it is about creating value for **diverse stakeholders**. [def] the term stakeholders here refers to **buyers, sellers, investors in a company, community residents, and even citizens of the nations where goods and services are made or sold**. [MY]: different from stakeholder from project management, which is people who is affected or can influence the project.
* One important stakeholder is the consumer. A consumer is the ultimate user of a good or service. Consumers can be individuals or organizations (although we usually use the term "customer" when referring to an organization), whether a company, government, charity, or association. So while some like to say "the customer is king", it is important to recognize that **marketing is not just about satisfying customer needs, it is about satisfying the needs of all the parties involved in an exchange**. **The seller needs to make a profit to stay in busienss to be able to continue offering the goods and services valued by the customer**. Similarly, a not-for-profit organization needs to match its supply of resources with custommer demand. This is the philosophy behind the marketing concept. The marketing concept suggests **organizational objectives such as long-term profitability are best met by first understanding what customers need (value sought) and then determining the associated costs of satisfying those needs (creating and delivering that value)--thus creating exchanges of mutual satisfaction.** Central to the philosophy reflected in the marketing concept is **an understanding that organizations exist to create value for consumers where it is neither efficient nor effective for consumers to attempt to satisfy their needs themselves.
* [def] **a need is the difference between a consumer's actual state and some ideal or desired state.** When the difference is big enough, the consumer is motivated to take action to satisfy the need. When you are hungry, you buy a snack. If you're not happy with your hair, you get a new look. **Needs are related to phsical conditions, such as being cold, hungry, or scared, and psychological conditions such as being liked, commmunicating with others, or being fulfilled**. The specific way a need is satisfied depends on an individual's history, learning experiences, and cultural environment. [def] **a want is a desire for a particular product used to satisfy a need in specific ways that are cultural and socially influenced** for example, two classmates' stomatchs runble during  a noon-hour class, and both need food. How each of them satisfies this need may be quite different. One might crave a salad or a bag of trail mix to go. The other might buy a cheeseburger and fries. On the want may be even more specific. I want Mountain Country Yogurt Trail Mix or a McDonald's cheeseburger. **Consumers are motivated by needs, but make purchase decisions based on wants.**
* **A product delivers a benefit when it satisfies a need or want.** **For marketers to be successful, they must develop products that provide one or more benefits**. **The challenge is to identify what benefits people look for, develop a product that delivers those benefits, and then convince buyers that it does so better than a competitor's product**. **As the management expert Peter Drucker worte, "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous**. **What Drucker means is if we succeed in creating a product that meets the needs of the customer, he or she will happily buy it without any "persuasion" from a salesperson. The salesperson may still be required to make the customer aware of the product and its relative merits in them--and typically less about the particular features or funcitons that deliver those benefits.** You buy a cordless drill because you care about the ease of making holes (the benefit). You may buy a particular brand of cordless drill because of differences in particular features that enable some drills to deliver the core benefit better than others.
* Everyone can want your product, but they doesn't ensure sales unless they have the means to obtain it. When you couple desire with the buying power or resources to satisfy a want, the result is **demand**. So, the potential customers for a snappy, red BMW convertible are the people who want the car minus those who can't afford to buy or lease one. **A market consists of all the consumers who share a common need that can be satisfied by a product purchase and who have the resources, willingness, and authority to make the purchase**.
* A marketplace used to be a location where buying and selling occurred face to face. The marketplace may still be a street corner or an open air market, but in today's "wired" world, buyers and sellers might not ever see each other. Increasingly the modern marketplace takes the form of a **glitzy shopping mall, a mail-order catalogue, a television shopping network, a eBay auction site, or an e-commerce website**.

### Marketing is About Exchange Relationships
* **At the heart of every marketing act--big or small--is something we refer to as an "exchange relationship"**. An exchange occurs when something is obtained for something else in return. **The buyer receives an object, service, or idea that satisfies a need and the seller receives something he or she believes is of equivalent economic value.** Usually this is money, but it could be other goods or services. Almost anything of value can be exchanged--including, **your time, your ideas, and the thing you can do**. Politicians exchange **promises for votes**, athletes and performers **exchange performances for ticket sales and exchange their images via endorsements in exchange for product sales**. Places like Canada's Wonderland or Prince Edward Island **exchange experiences for customers' time and money**. Not-for-profit organizations like Covenant House exchange **services for the time of their clients and exchange the concept of making a difference to the problem of homelessness for the money of their donators**. **For an exchange to occur, at least two people or organizations must be willing to make a trade, and each must have sommething the other wants. Both parties must agree on the value of the exchange and how it will be carried out. Each party also must be free to accept or reject the other's terms for the exchange.** Under these conditions, a gun-wielding rober's offer to "exchange" your money for your life does not constitute a valid economic exchange. 

### Marketing As a Decision-making Process
The American Marketing Association definition of marketing suggests that **marketing is primarily a decision-making process that allows individuals and organizations to achieve objectives by creating value that satisfies stakeholder needs and wants.** As such, marketing decision making involves a series of steps that entail both careful thought (planning) and action(executing). When it's done right, marketing is a strategic decision-making process in which marketing managers determine the most appropriate set of decision for a particular organization at a particular time that will help the organization meet its long term objective

##### Understand the Opportunity
* **Marketing decisions start with understanding the situation, or context, in which the decision need to be made.** **Situational analysis** involves identifying opportunities to create value for the organization by creating value for customers. First, it involes understanding factors relating to **the markets in which an organization competes**, such as **understanding general trends in that market, consumer or organizational buying behavior, industry dynamics, and the strategies and likely reactions of competitors**. The marketing decision makers need to assess factors relating to **their own organization and their ability to create value and compete effectively in those markets**. These internal factors include **understanding the relative effectiveness of their current marketing strategy, their resources, competencies, and expertise, and the values or mission of the organization**.

##### Specify the Value: Market Strategy
* Marketer make marketing strategy decisions to achieve the objectives of their organization, which usually include both **financial objectives (such as a particular profit target)** and **marketing objectives (such as sales targets or market share targets)**. **Once the marketing and other objectives are developed, the organization develops a marketing strategy aimed at achieving those objectives**.
* The **most critical** decision marketers make in developing marketing strategy is **the selection of the specific group of customers** on which they will focus their customer value creation efforts. [def] A market segment is **a distinct group of customers within a large market who have similar needs, wants, preferences, and behaviors, who seek similar product solution, and whose needs differ from other customers in the larger market**. Parents with young children, for example, typically seek different entertainment products than teenagers and young adults.
* [def] Market segmentation is **the process of dividing the overall market into groups of consumers who are sufficiently similar within the group to want a similar value offer and different enough from other groups to want a different value offer than those other groups**. The challenge is to identify groups with real differences in underlying needs, wants, preferences, behaivors, and opinions about value. Consequently, detailed segment profiles of each group msut be developed that specify these differences and other characteristics of the group that will help marketers design and present a valued offer.  For example, one way the Levi Strauss lices up the market is in terms of age segments--this makes sense, since different age group have different purposes. **Business-to-busienss markets** are someimtes divided into segments using characteristics such as type of business, decision-making criteria, size, or sales volume, if these characteristics reflect differences in the needs, wants, or behaivours of organizations.
* Marketers weigh each of the segments in terms of **profitability potential against a number of factors**, including **the organization's ability to create value and satisfy the needs of the segments**, **their goals and resources, and their ability to compete effectively against other offering**. On the basis of this analysis, the organization decides whether it will focus on a single segment or on several segments. The chosen market(s) become the organization's target market(s) toward which it directs its marketing efforts. For example, Hewitt is an outsourcing cojmpany that has decided to focus exclusively on the needs of the human resources professional. As the ad for Hewitt illustrates, it offers tailored solutino in HR areas such as talent, benefits, payroll, health care, retirement.
* Because different target markets have different and sometimes conflicting needs, wants, and preferences, marketers typically have to choose among alternative segments on which to focus. This is one of Richard Hill's dilemmas at Yellow Point Lodge--how to attract new consumers without turning off long-loyal consumers at the same time. Similarly, Canadian fashion designer Linda Lundstrom (and her company, Linda Lundstrom Ltd) doesn't make clothes for everyone. First, she designs clothes only for women. Lundstrom further narrows her market by focusing on the needs of women with less than perfect figures. She also gears her line toward working women who need clothes that can wear and travel well. Her most successful item is an extremely warm winter coat that combines comfort and function with a style based on First Nations artist Norval Morrisseau's traditional patterns.
* Some firms choose to reach as many customers as possible by offering their products to a mass market, which consists of all possible customers in a market, regardless of the difference in their specific needs and wants. This strategy, however, is not tenable in the long run. Usually competitors of mass markets, or even the mass marketers themselves, bring alternative products to market that have greater appeal to a subset of the people in the mass market, eroding the market share of the mass market product
* Many companies know that they must look for potential target markets beyond their own geographical borders to compete in today's world economy. Modern marketers are busy meeting the needs of people all around the world, especially when the demand for products at home flattens. Expanding internationally is desirable,, for example, to the Mattel Corporation (www.mattel.com). The average North American girl owns eight barbies, making it the best-selling toy ever. The domestic market is starting to become saturated, so Mattel is diversifying to offset the company's reliance on North American Barbie sales. Europe has nearly twice as many children as North America; and numbers in Mexico, South America, Japan, and Southeast Asia are even greater. Mattel now manufactures 75 percent of its toys in plants around the world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Mexico, and Italy
* **Positioning** After choosing the target market(s), marketers need to develop an offering that appeals to the needs, wants, and prefernces of the target market better than alternatives provided by competitors. This process starts with positioning the product. **Positioning** involves developing a marketing strategy to differentiate an offering from others in the marketplace in the mind of the target customers. It establishes how the marketing organization wants its brand to be known--what value it offers relative to competitors and why that offer is superior to others for a particular target market. Positioning also involves developing strategy to defend the image that has or will be created and specifying the unique competencies, resources, and know-how that allows a firm to sustain its superiority. The positioning of a brand often involves developing a brand personality. For example, VOSS Water (www.vosswater.com) has developed a personality of sophistication. Its water comes from a "virgin aquifer that has been shielded for centuries under ice and rock in the untouched wilderness of Central Norway". At prices ranging up to $22.00 for a 0.5L bottle, customers are putting a significant premium on that personality!

#### Create the Value: Marketing Mix Decisions
Once t he desired positioning is established, marketers need to create the value proposition reflected in the offer. To do this, marketers make a set of decisions about the product itself, its price, the place it is available for purchase, and the activities that introduce it to consumers. These decisions, collectively called the marketing mix decisions, create the value promised by the product positioning and are intended to be sufficiently motivating (valuable) to create a desired exchange response among members of the target market. Just as every college student seems to have an iPod, every government official seems to have a BlackBerry. The marketing mix decisions made by Apple and RIM created a value proposition so motivating that they have had trouble keeping up with demand.
* The marketing mix decisions are commonly known as the four Ps. **product, price, promotion(communication), and place(distribution). Together, the bundle of marketing mix elements represents an offer of value to the consumer: What the consumer will receive in an exchange. Sometimes marketers consider a fifth P, "people" or relationship. Others, including the authors of this book, view managing exchange relationship as being so central to what marketers do that it should be integrated into all the other marketing decisions and not treated as a separate decision.
* Just as a radio DJ puts together a collection of separate songs ( amusical mix) to create a certain mood, the idea of a mix in this context reminds us that no single marketing activity is sufficient to accomplish the organization's objectives, and that consistency among the decisions is critical to the overall marketing program.

###### Product
* **The product is a good, service, idea, place, person**--whatever is offered for exchange. Notice, therefore, that the concept of product as defined in marketing is broader than its usage in everyday language, where it primarily signifies a tangible good. Product strategy decisions begin with objectives: What do you want to achieve with your product decision? For example, Proctor & Gamble (P&G) wanted to expand its market share internationally but found that many consumers could not afford its traditional brands. This prompted P&G to develop new products, such as Pampers Uni diapers, that are tailored to meet the needs of international customers, such as those in Brazil, but have a significantly lower cost structure. Then you need to specify the product concept. What is the core value (benefit) you are offering, and how do you deliver that value through the features, functions, design, and other attributes of the product? Marketers also make product line decisions about how many variants or versions (models, types, sizes, colors, shapes, flavors) of a product they will offer. Honda, for example, chooses to compete with just a few models of cars, while General Moters has more than 100. Service strategy decisions also need to be made. Disneyland or Walt Disney World, the strategy to create the desired customer experience is central to what they do, but even packaged goods like cereal or consumer goods like a notebook computer can have important service aspects. Dell, for example, offers free delivery, online and phone-based technical support, and a range of options for getting your computer fixed if there is a problem, including in-home repair. Product decisions also include **branding strategy**: Will a product be part of a family of product like Cambell's soups, an individual brand like BlackBerry, a store brand like President's Choice, or just be named for the product category, like "Spaghetti"? Finally, **product decisions include packaging and labelling decisions. Be honest, how many times have you bought something because the package looked good?**

###### Price
* The price is the seller's assessment of the value of a product; what they would liketo receive from the buyer in exchange for the product. Pricing strategy decisions start with pricing objectives: What do you want to accomplish with your pricing decisions? Are you trying to support a premium position like Gucci, a competitive position like Zellers or Wal-Mart(lower prices), or you trying to increase market share, like Procter & Gamble in Brail? **Different pricing objectives suggest different pricing policies.** P & G used to determine its prices based on what a product actually cost to develop plus a profit, but now it prices products by what consumers in different countries can afford. Walmart uses Every Day Low Prices as a policy. Marketers also have to ome up with the actual price. Price point decisions need to take into consideration the cost of creating and delivering the product, competitors' prices, and what the customer is willing to pay, among other factors. There are also psychological consideraitons. Should the price of Croc shoes be $39.99 or $37.54, or $40.00? Finally, marketers need to decide or pricing terms and conditions: When does the price need to be paid, how can it be paid, are there any special deals or discounts?

###### Distribution
Place concerns the availability of the product to the customer at the desired time and locatino. Channels of distribution involve firms that work together to get a product from a producer to a consumer. For consumer goods like Root clothing products, a distribution channel includes retailer suchas Sears as well as their own Root retail outlets and the Root website. **Distribution decisions begin with specifying the distribution objectives: Are you trying to make the product as widely available as possible, minimize the cost of getting the product to the customer, or make it easy for customers to compare your product with others--such as with an Auto Mall?** To achieve one or another of these distribution objectives, marketers decide on a distribution system: **What type of distribution system will be created, how many traditional approach or non-traditional one?** Channel relationship management decisions also need to be made: How will you identify, attract, motivate, and keep your channel partners working toward your common goals and how will you deal with the conflict that is inherent between the roles of channel members? Finally, supply chain management involves systems and process to ensure efficient and effective value creation, from the sourcing of raw materials to the customer receiving the value. The include logistics, the physical distribution of goods to the customer, or a service blueprint for delivering a service experience.

###### Communication
Promotion refers to **the marketing commmunication activities undertaken to inform consumers or organizations about goods, services, or ideas, and to encourage potential customers to buy these goods, services, or ideas**. Unlike the other marketing mix decisions, **communication strategy decisions start with deciding the audience, or target of the commmunication, not the commmunication objective**. The audience is a specific subset of a target market whose members are the receives of the communication. **A communication campaign usually has many different elements targeted at different audiences, but we design the strategy for each audience.** For each audience we need to decide the commmunication objectives: **What do you want to achieve with your communication decisions? is the objective to create awareness about your product, develop purchase intentions, encourage trial of the product, or develop trust with your customers** To achieve these or other communications objectives, **marketers need to decide on an overall approach to the communication strategy: Will it be a push strategy where retailers are encouraged to stock products that customers can find or a pull strategy where customers are encouraged to seek products from retailers or other channel members?** Will it be one-way communication or will you seek feedback from customers and try to develop a relationship with them? Once the overall approach is decided, we need to decide the key messages; what we want to communicate to our audience; and the tactics we will use to get their attention. Then we decide on the appropriate communications mix to get our message(s) to our audience: Should we develop advertising for television, radio, or print pulications; create promotions like Tim Hortons' Roll Up the Rim to Win contest; use public relations as Raincoast Books used to gain free publicity around Harry Potter book launches; communicate using a sales force; create a website; or use viral marketing techniques such as developing entertaining video clips that customers can sendtheir friends? We also need to decide on a creative strategy that will get the attention of our audience, schedule the timing and placement of any advertising that is used, determine a budget to do all this, and develop a way to evaluate whether our communication strategy has been effective.
* For example, Mike's Hard Lemonade Company's communication strategy supports the brand image by developing and supporting the "personalities" of Mike and the lemonade. Cute stories about Mike and lemons were included on the packaging, and the product was brought to consumers' attention with print advertising, in-store displays, and on-shelf signage. After Mike's initial success, television advertising was created that showed "lemon being hurt real bad in the making of this product" and investigators trying to determine "who has been hurting the lemons". These quirky, light-hearted ads helped make Mike's the leading brand in the Canadian cooler market. There is also a hip Internet site (www.mikeshardlemonade.com) that further supports the brand's personality.


Because of all these, there are lots of decisions that marketers make for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Once made these decision need to be acted upon

### Implementation and Evaluation: Realize the Value
Before we can evaluate the realtive merits of our proposed marketing decisions we need plan for their implementatino, **such as identifying the key actions that need to be done, assigning tasks to people to do them, and developing a schedule of when they need to be completed.** Implementation decisions also involve developing **performance benchmarks(targets) to help us assess if our strategy is working** and **a contingency plan that outlines what we will do if things do not go as planned**. Finally, we need to **identify the key assumptions** that we have made in developing our plan and **outline how we will use market research to test those assumptions and ensure we are making informed decisions**. We also need to **specify and allocate a budget** to make all this happen.
* After planning the implementation, **we then need to decide whether or not to proceed.** This overall recommendation is based on an assessment of whether implementing the strategy **is worth it from the organization's perspective (value to the organization).** To make this decision we need to do *financial analysis* and *cost-benefit* analysis, which you will learn more about in Chapter 2. This decision is usually made in contrast to other viable alternatives, to ensure that the best strategy is being considered. **The alternatives typically come from different choice of target markets, different positioning, or different ways of creating value via the marketing mix. It may seem like a lot of wasted work to end up not recommending implementation--but you can't make an informed decision without first specifying the best strategy you can think of.**
* If you decide to implement the strategy, the next step is execution--getting it done and then measuring performance against the plan. Throughout this text we will show you examples of measures, or "metrics", that marketers use to assess their performance.
* In the final chapter, we will show you **how this marketing decision process comes together in the creation of a formal marketing plan**. Marketing planning is **a process of identifying and analyzing alternative ways of competing in the marketplace.** To see how much thinking and anylsis goes into marketing decisions, consider some of the many factors a firm like Levi Strauss has to think about when planning and developing its marketing strategy:

                * What jeans styles will our core customers of young people be looking for in three to five years?
                * What are our competitors doing to attract and keep our customers? How are we positioned competitively in the mind of the consumer?
                * Which customer groups that don't currently buy a lot of blue jeans might we target for Levi's products?
                * How will new developments in computerized production technologies affect the denim manufacturing process?
                * Will the current trend for many companies to institute "Causal Fridays" when employees can wear jeans to work, affect long term demand for Levi's products
                * What will be the impact on our brand's image if we decide to sell our jeans through discount stores such as Walmart?
                * Is television advertising (an expensive marketing commmunications tool) the right way to communicate with our target market, or is there a better way?
                * How will consumers' growing awareness about the use of child labour in Third World countries affect their attitude toward manufacturers that locate plants overseas?

* an example of a marketing plan in the appendix, Chpater 2 focuses on the environment of marketing decisions and introduces the internal and external environment. Chapter 3 focuses on how to make target market and positioning decisions. Chapter 4 gives you an introduction to the research marketers do to make informed decisions. Chapters 5 and 6 examine key consumer and organizational buying behavior concepts that help us develop better market segment profiles. Chapter 7 through 13 focus on the marketing mix decisions. Chapter 14 pulls it all together and shows you how all the marketing decisions must support each other in the writing of a marketing plan and how the tools, concepts, and principles discussed throughout the text can be used to provide rationale for a particular course of action.

### The Marketing of Value
* So far, we have talked a lot about marketing delivering value to customers. As we noted as the beginning of this chapter, value refers to the benefits a customer receives from buying a good or service relative to the costs of acquiring and using it. Marketing then communicates these benefits to the customer in the form of a value proposition, **a marketplace offering that fairly and accurately sums up the value that the customer will realize if he or she purchases the product**. The challenge to the marketers is to create an attractive value proposition. A bit part of this challenge is convincing customers that this value proposition is superior to others they might choose from competitors.
* How do customers (such as your potential employer) decide how much value they will get from a purchase? **One way to look at value is to think of it simply as a ratio of benefits to costs--that is, customers "invest" their precious time and money to do business with a firm, and they expect a certain bundle of benefits in return**. **But here's the tricky part. Value is in the eye of the beholder, meaning that something (or someone) may be worth a lot to the planet, but a prospective employer may form a different opinion.** **A big part of marketing is ensuring that the thing being exchanged is appreciated for the value it holds**. Let's look at value from the different perspectives of the parties that are involved in an exchange: the customers, the sellers, and society.

###### Value from the Customer's Perspective
SKIM: [summary] the value proposition includes the whole bundle of benefits the firm promise to deliver, like making a statement about the type of person you are or wish you were.

###### Value from the Seller's Perspective
* SKIM: [summary] They determine whether the exchange is profitable to the seller. That's a very important factor, but not the only one. For example, in addition to making a buck or two, many firms measure value along other dimensions, such as prestige among rivals or pride in doing what they do well. Some firms by definition doen't even care about making money, or they may not even be allow to make money; nonprofit like Greenpeace, the Canadian Cancer Society, or CBC Radio regard value in terms of their ability to motivate, educate, or delight the public.
* Company that calculate the lifetime value of a customer look at how much profit they expect to make from a particular customer, including each and every purchase he or she will make from them now and in the future. To calculate lifetime value, company estimate the amount the person will spend and then subtract what it will cost to maintain this relationship. College and university students are particularly important to banks because you represent a lifetime of value to them, and while you might not have much money now, one day you probably will.

###### Providing Value To Stakeholders By Creating a Competitive Advantage
* All things being equal, a firm creates value for stakeholders when it convinces customers that they will acquire greater value by buying its products rather than those of competitors. How are companies able to accomplish this goal? The answer is that the underlying goal of all marketing strategies is to create a competitive advantage for the firm. A firm has a **competitive advantage when it is able to outperform the commpetition, providing customers with a benefit the competition can't.** A competitive advantage gives consumers a reason to choose one product over another again and again.
* How does a firm go about creating a competitive advantage. The first step is to **identify what it does really well. A distinctive competency is a firm's capability that is superior to that of its competition.** For example, Coca-Cola's success in global markets--Coke commands 50 percent of the world's soft drink business--is relatived to its distinctive commpetencies in distribution and marketing communications. Coke's distribution system got a jump on the competition during World War II. To enable soldiers fighting overseas to enjoy a five-cent Coke, the US government assisted Coca-Cola in building 64 overseas bottling plants. Coke's skilful marketing commmunications program, a second distinctive competency, has contributed to its global success. In addtion to its television commmercials, Coke blankets less-developed countries such as Tanzania with its print advertisements so that even people without televisions will think of Coke when they get thirsty.
* The second step in developing a competitive advantage is **to turn a distinctive competency into differential benefit--one that is important to customers**. Differential benefits **set product apart from competitiros' products by providing something unique that customers want. Differential benefits provide reasons for customers to pay a premium for a firm's products and exhibit a strong brand preference**. For many years loyal Apple computer users benefited from **superior graphics capability** compared to their PC-using counterparts. Later, when PC manufacturers caught up with this competitive advantage, Apple relied on **its inventive product designers to create another differential benefit--futuristic looking computers in a multitude of colours**. This competitive advantage even caused many loyal PC users to take a bite of the Apple.

###### Adding Value Through the Value Chain
* Many different players--both within and outside a firm--need to work together to create and deliver value to customers. One approach to understanding the delivery of value and satisfaction is the value chain. This term refers to a series of activities involved in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting any product. In addition to marketing activities, the value chain includes business functions such as human resource management and technology development.
* This concept reminds us that every product starts with raw materials that are of relatively limited avalue to the end customer. Each link in the chain has the potential to either add or remove value from the product the customer eventually buys. The successful firm is t he one that can perform one or more of these activities better than other firms--this is its competitive advantage. The main activies of value-chain members include the following:

        * Bring in materials to make the product, referred to as "inbound logistics"
        * Converting the materials in to the final product, referred to as "operations"
        * Shipping out the final product, referred to as "outbound logistics"
        * Marketing the final product, in which marketing and sales come into play
        * Servicing the product/customer, referred to as "service" 

* A Value Chain for the Apple iPod

        Inbound Logistics
        * Planar lithium battery (Sony)
        * Hard drive (Toshiba)
        * MP3 decoder and controller chip (Portal Player)
        * Flash memory chip (Sharp Electronics Corp.)
        * Stero digital-to-analog converter (Wolfson Microelectronics Ltd)
        * Firewire interface controller (Texas Instruments)

        Operations
        * Consumer research
        * New-product-development team
        * Engineering and production

        Outbound logistics
        * Trucking companies
        * Wholesalers
        * Retailers

        Marketing and Sales
        * Advertising
        * Sales force

        Service
        * Computer technicians

* All these companies (and more) belong to Apple's value chain. This means that Apple must make a lot of value-chain decisions. What electronic components will go into its music players? What accessories will be included in the package? What trucking companies, wholesalers, and retailers will deliver the iPods to stores? What service will it provide to customers after the sale? And what marketing strategies will it use? In some cases, **members of a value chain will work together to coordinate their activities** to be more efficient and thus create a competitive advantage
* We will start with a focus on how companies decide what to make, how and where to sell it, and whom to sell it to. Then, we'll take a look at how they decide to "position" the product in the marketplace, including choices about what it should look like, how its value should be communicated to customers, and how much to charge for it. As we reach the end of our marketing journey, we'll talk about how the product actually gets delivered to consumers.

#### value from Society's Perspective
* Every company's activities influence the world around it, in ways both good and bad. Therefore, we must also consider how marketing transactions add or subtract value from society. In many ways, we are at the mercy of marketers because we trust them to sell us products that are safe and perform as promised. We also trust them to price and distribute these products fairly. Conflicts often arise in business when the pressure to succeed in the marketplace provokes dishonest business practices--the collapse of energy giant Enron and the tiral of its (later) former chief executive officer Ken Lay are a case in point.

###### The Dark Side of Marketing
* Whether intentionally or not, some marketers do violate their bond of trust with consumers, and unfortunately the "dark side" of marketing often is the subject of harsh criticism. In some cases, these violations are illegal, such as when retailer **adopt a "bait-and-switch" selling strategy, luring consumers into the store with promises of inexpensive products with the sole intent of getting them to switch to higher-priced goods.**
* In other cases, marketing practices have detrimental effects on society even though they are not actually illegal. Some alcohol and tobacco companies *advertise in low-income neighbourhoods* where abuse of these products is a big problem. Other sponsor commercials depicting groups of people in an unfavourable light or *sell products that encourage antisocial behavior*. An online game based on the Columbine High School massacre drew criticism from some (including the father of a student who died in the 1999 attack) who say it trivializes the actions of the two teen killers.
* Some harmful consumer behaviors such as excessive drinking or cigarette smoking stem from social pressures, and the cultural value placed on money encourages activities such as shoplifting or insurance fraud. Exposure to unattainalbe ideals of beauty and success can create dissatisfaction with the self. Let's briefly review some dimensions of "the dark side" of consumer behaviour.

        1. **marketers create artificial needs** The marketing system has come under fire from both ends of the political spectrum. On the one hand, some members of the religious right believe that advertising contributes to the moral breakdown of society by presenting images of sinful pleasure. On the other hand, some leftists argue that the same deceitful promises of material pleasure function to buy off people who would otherwise be revolutionaries working to change the system. They argue that the system creates demand that only its products can satisfy. **A Response**: A need is a basic motive, while a want represents one way that society has taught us the need can be satisfied. For example, while thirst is biologically based, we are taught to want Coca-Cola to satisfy that thirst rather than, say, water. Thus, the need is already there; marketers simply recommend ways to satisfy it. If the basic need is not there, no amount of slick marketing communication tactics is going to convince consumers to buy.
        2. Marketing teaches us to value people for what they own rather than who they are. Goods are arbitrarily linked to desireable qualities, so we learn that we can be popular, happy, and fulfilled only if we buy these products. A response: Products meet existing needs, and advertising only helps to communicate their availability. Advertising is an important source of consumer information. It is a service for which consumers are willing to pay because the information it provides reduce the time and effort needed to learn about the product

### Careers in Marketing
* Many students asume that the "typical" marketing job is in a large, consumer-oriented packaged goods commpany like Procter&Gamble. In fact, marketers work in other types of organizations, for example:

        Service organizations (e.g., Telus, Intrawest)
        E-commerce organizations (e.g., Chapters Online; Amazon.ca)
        Technology companies (e.g., IBM Canada; Bombardier)
        Industrial equipment companies (e.g., Komatsu; Nortel)
        Retailers (e.g., Shoppers Drug mart; Sears)

        2. Do you think students should study marketing even if they are not planning a career in marketing or busienss? Explain your reasoning.
        3. In this chapter, a number of criticisms of marketing were discussed. Have you heard these criticisms before? What other criticisms of marketing have you heard? Do you agree or disagree with these criticisms, and why?

* Marketing Practice:

        1. An old friend of yours has been making and selling leather handbags and bookbags to acquaintances and friends for some time and is now thinking about opening a shop in your town. But he is worried about whether he'll have enough customers who want handcrafted bags to keep a business going. Knowing that you are a marketing student, he asks you for some advice. What can you tell him about market segments, target markets, product, price, marketing communications, and distribution strategies that will help him get his business off the ground?
        2. Assume that you are employed by your city's chamber of commerce. A major focus of the chamber is to get industires to move to your city. As a former marketing student, you know that there are issues involving product, price, marketing communications, and even distribution that can attract busienss. Next week, you have an opportunity to speak to the members of the chamber, and your topic will be "Marketing a City". Develop an outline for that presentation
        3. As a marketing professional, you have been asked to write a short piece ofr a local business newsletter about the state of marketing today. You think the best way to address this topic is to review how the marketing concept has evolved and to discuss the New Era orientation of marketing. Write the short article you will submit to the editor of the newsletter.
        4. You and your friends sometimes discuss the various courses you are taking. One of your friends says to you, "Marketing's nothing but selling stuff. Anybody can do that without taking a course." Another friend says, "yeah, all marketers do is write ads". As a role-playing exercise, present your argument against these statements to your class.

* Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing

        The purpose of this mini-project is to develop an understanding of the importance of marketing to different organization.
        1. Working as a team with two or three other students in your class, select an organization in your community that practices marketing. it may be a manufacturer, service provider, retailer, not-for-profit organization--almost any organization will do. Schedule a visit with someone in the organization who is involved in the marketing activities. Ask that person to give your group a tour of the facilities and explain the organization's marketing activities.
        2. Divide the following topics among your team, and ask each person to be responsible for developing a set of questions to ask during the interview to learn about the comapny's program:

                * What customer segment the company targets
                * How it determines needs and wants
                * What products it offers, including features, benefits, and goals for customer satisfaction
                * What its pricing strategies are, including any discounting policies
                * What marketing communication strategies it uses, and what these emphasize to position the product(s)
                * How it distributes products, and whether it has encountered any problems
                * How marketing planning is done and who does it
                * Whether social responsibility is part of the marketing program and, if so, in what way
                
        3. Develop a team report of your findings. In each section of the report, share what you learned that is new or surprising to you compared to what you expected (based on your reading of Chapter 1)
        4. Develop a team presentation for your class that summarizes your findings. Conclude your presentation with ocmments on what your team believes the company was doing well and where it could make improvements.

* Real People, Real Surfers: exploring the Web

        The New Era orientation means that a firm like Mountain Equipment Co-op is devoted to excellence in sourcing and producing products that benefit customers as well as society, the organization's employees, and their members. Many firms share this on their Internet webpages, Visit  the website for Mountain Equipment Co-op (www.mec.ca). Then visit the website for one of their competitors such as REI (www.REI.com) or Taiga (www.taigaworks.ca). Follow the links in the sites to learn as much as you can about the company. You might first check the site map to see what links are provided on the site. Look for answers to the following questions.

                1. What evidence do you find on the firms' websites that each is a New Era firm?
                2. Which company has the better webiste? What makes it better? Based on your visit to the webiste, what do you think is the major purpose of each company's site? To promote their products? To sell on the web? To develop a brand image? Something else?
                3. How does each company use its webiste for promoting its products? Is the website a unique form of marketing communications or jsut an extension of their normal advertising?
                4. What market segment do you think each firm is targeting with its website? What features of the websites gave you this idea?
                5. Do the websites provide an opportunity for the firm to gather information about customers so that it can customize contact with them
                6. Are there any features of the website that will cause consumers to come back again and again?
                7. What are your major criticisms of each of the webiste? What would you do to improve each site from a marketing perspective?

### Case Study

# Chapter 2: Making Strategic Marketing Decisions
* Case study: Michel Bendayan with Megablok (www.megabloks.com). SKIM
* Whether a firm is a not-for-profit organization like the United Way, a family-based retailer like Army & Navy department stores, or a major manufacturer like Mega Bloks, **planning for the future in a key to prosperity. Success in the competitive world of business is not accidental; businesses that succeed do so because they are capable of developing and implementing superior strategies in the marketplace. Often, businesses that fail meet their fate because of improper planning**
* All firms operate in a dynamic environment. In today's world of business, consumer interests, technologies, commpetition, and the economy are changing faster than ever. This makes good planning more important than ever, as planning enables a firm to meet the challenges of this dynamic environment and to control its own destiny.
* In this chapter, we'll look at the different steps in creating and implementing plans within a business organization. First we'll examine **how marketers make the decisions that guide the entire organization**. Then we'll examine how marketers make the marketing decision outlined in Chapter 1. Finally, we will discuss the global and ethical context in which marketing decisions are made.
* In successful firms, both large and small, **business planning is an ongoing process of making decisions that guide the firm both in the short term and for the long haul. Planning identifies and builds on a firm's strengths and helps managers at all levels make informed decisions in a changing business environment. Planning means that an  organization develops objectives before it takes action**. In large firms, such as IBM, Sony, and L'Oreal, which operate in many markets, **planning is a complex process involving many people from different areas of the company's operations**. In a small business like Mac's Diner, however, planning is quite different; Mac himself is chief cook, occasional dishwasher, and the sole company planner. With mid-size firms, the planning process falls somewhere in between, depending on the size of the firm and the complexity of its operations.
* Business plan's process is more complex than our day-to-day planning. Business planning usually occurs on an annual basis at three level--strategic planning, marketing planning, and operational planning.

                * What it is: Strategic Planning
                * Who does it: planning done by top-level corporate management
                * What they do: 
                        1. Define the mission
                        2. Evaluate the internal and external environment
                        3. Set organizational or SBU objectives
                        4. Establish the business portfolio (if applicable)
                        5. Develop growth strategies and tactics

                * What it is: Functional Planning (In Marketing Department, called Marketing Planning)
                * Who does it: Planning done by top functional-level management such as the firm's chief marketing officer (CMO)
                * What they do:
                        1. Perform a situation analysis
                        2. Set marketing objectives 
                        3. Develop marketing strategies

                        5. Monitor and control marketing strategies

                * What it is: Operatinoal Planning
                * Who does it: Planning done by supervisory managers
                * What they do: 
                        1. Develop action plans to implement the marketing plan
                        2. Use marketing metrics to monitor how the plan is working

* **Strategic planning** is the managerial decision process that matches the organization's resources (for example, manufacturing facilities, financial assets, and skilled workforce) and capabilities to its market opportunities for long-term growth. These decisions focus on the firm's ability to respond to changes and opportunities in its environment. **In a strategic plan, the top management team (that is, the chief executive officer, or CEO, president, and other top executives) defines the firm's purpose (mission) and specifies what the firm hopes to achieve over the next few years (organizational objectives)**. Increasingly this planning takes place in consultation with a cross-section of employees who bring varied perspectives and knowledge to the process. For example, a firm's strategic plan may set a goal of increasing t he firm's total revenues by 10 or even 20 percent in the next five years. Strategies and tactics are then developed for achieving those objective. **Strategies reflect what a firm is going to do to achieve an objective. For example, to increase total revenues by 20 percent in the next five years, an organization like Mega Bloks may decide to enter a new market with either new or existing products.** **Tactics reflect how a strategy is going to be implemented. For example, Mega Bloks may decide to enter the Japanese market with a product line customized for the Japanese consumer**.
* Strategic plans are usually developed for a period of three to five years and take a long-term view of the strategic health of the business. In large firms, strategic planning can actually occur at two different levels. **First, there is overall corporate strategic planning, which determines the organization's different business and product pursuits. Second, the individual business units do strategic planning for their products.** **Strategic planning at the Walt Disney Company, for example, involves an assessment of resources and capabilities for starting new business. In addition to making movies and running theme parks, Disney is now in the cruise ship business and operates a number of Disney vacation resorts. Disney's corporate planning expanded its theme park business to Europe and Japan--separate business units**.
* **Given its high-level, long-term emphasis, a strategic plan is not a document that can be readily implemented. Therefore firms develop a one-year plan, called the marketing plan, which takes its direction from the strategic plan and develops lower-level strategies and tactics for achieving the objectives specified in the strategic plan.** There are two main differences between a strategic plan and a marketing plan. The first is time horizon. While the strategic plan is developed for a period of three to five years, the marketing plan is typically developed for a period of one year. **The second difference is that the marketing plan contains details regarding the marketing mix elements (product strategy, pricing strategy, channel of distribution strategy, marketing communication strategy), while the strategic plan does not contain this level of detail**. What is sometimes confusing about strategies and tactics is that a tactic at the organizational (strategic plan) level becomes, or is reflected in, the strategy at the functional level, and functional level tactics become, or are reflected in, operational strategies.
* **For example, at the strategic planning level, Mega Blok's strategy may be to expand internationally. Their tactic to do this may be to enter t he japanese market with a product line customized for the Japanese consumer. At the marketing planning level, this becomes the strategy to achieve more specific marketing objectives such as "have 20 percent of sales come from new markets this year" and "earn a profit of $5 million from those new market sales". At the marketing planning level, the marketing mix decisions to achieve this market entry strategy are the tactics that specify how the strategy will be implemented and the objectives achieved. In the operational (or immmplementation) plan, a marketing mix decision such as establishing a unique Japanese brand personality for Mega Bloks in Japan becomes the strategy (what you are going to do) while decisions reflecting how this will be done, such as hiring an advertising agency to create a Japanese anime cartoon character, are the tactics. So while strategies reflect what to do and tactics reflect how to do it, they are related across levels of analysis and differ in increasing levels of specificity.**
* Perhaps you are beginning to see the central role played by marketers in the organizatinoal, functional, and operational planning process. **The development of the marketing plan enables the business to set priorities regarding markets it wants to compete in (market segment), customers it wants to serve (target customers), and how it plans to serve those customers (marketing mix strategy). Once these priorities are set, the business develops a set of more specific plans** such as a sales plan, production plan, finance plan, supply chain plan, a human resource plan. Collectively, some businesses call these plans the operating plans or tactical plans. Based upon the requirements of each functional plan, the business is now in a position to allocate resources for the year by setting a budget. Although this process starts from the top of an organization and works its way down to specific tactical decisions, it is typically a two-way process. Marketing and other functional plans are adapted based on the specific objectives and decisions reflected in operational plans and strategic plans are adapted based on the specific objectives and decisions reflected in the functional plans.

### STRATEGIC PLANNING: GUIDING THE BUSINESS
* Marketers don't work and plan in isolation. Before we talk about the marketing planning process, therefore, we need to understand how firms develop strategic plans. In this section, we'll take a closer look at **the five key stages in top-level strategic planning: defining the organization's business mission, evaluating the environment (situational analysis), setting organizational objectives, planning the business portfolio, and devloping growth strategies**.

#### Step 1: Define the Mission
* Top management's first step in the strategic planning process is to answer questions such as: **What business are we in? What customers should we serve? How should we develop the firm's capabilities and focus its effort?**
* In many organizations, the nawers to questions such is these become the lead items in the organizations's strateic plan. The answers become part of the mission statement--a formal description of the organization's purpose and what it hopes to achieve in terms of creating value for customers with what products and resources. For example, the mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is "to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime, and prevent underage drinking"
* The idea mission statement is not too broad, too narrow, or too short-sighted. Amission that is too broad will not provide adequate focus for the organization. It doesn't do much good to claim: "We are in the business of making high-quality product"; yet it's hard to find a firm that doesn't make this claim. **However, a mission statement that is too narrow may inhibit managers' ability to visualize possible growth opportunities. If, for example, a firm sees itself in terms of its product only, consumer trend or technology can make that product obsolete--and the firm is left with no future. If Xerox had continued to define its mission in terms of just producing copy machines instead of providing "document solutions", the shift to electronic documents would have left them in the dust the way the Model T Ford replaced the horse and buggy.** Similarly, imagine the disastrous consequences that would happen to McDonald's if its mission statement read:"We are in the hamburger business." It's important to remember that the need for a clear mission statement applies to virtually any type of organization, even those like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, whose objective is to serve society rather than to sell goods or services. Xerox is not alone in its effort to redefine itself. Philip Morris, once simply a tobacco products company, has redefined itself strategically as a consumer products company, offering many of the products we consume on a regular basis. Mission statements should also inspire customers and other stakeholders to want to do business with an organization. **The mission of Campbell's soup, for example, is "Together we will build the world's most extraordinary food company by nourishing people's lives everywhere, every day".**

#### Step 2: Conduct an Environmental (Situational) Analysis
* The second step in strategic planning is **an assessment of an organization's environment, both external and internal. This process is referred to as a *situation analysis*, *environmental analysis*, or sometimes a *business review*.** The external environment consists of t hose uncontrollable elements outside of the organization that may affect it either positively or negatively. While this can include everything from consumers to government regulations to competitors to the economy, there are four main categories of considerations. The first is looking for trends or issues in the macro or general environment that might have a positive or negative effect on your organization. These may be **p**olitical or legal, **e**conomic, **s**ocial or cultural, **t**echnological, or **o**ther (**p.e.s.t.o**) trends or issues that might impact a particular industry and business. **Mega Bloks, for example, might need to understand political or legal issues relating to foreign ownership of joint ventures before deciding how to enter the Japanese market. Similarly, Mega Bloks has to consider the implication of children, all around the world, being increasingly interested in electonic games.** McDonald's has to consider the implications of government imposing "fat" taxes or regulating the use of trans fats in the preparation and consumption of food and consider the social trend toward healthier lifestyles. Canadian lumber companies have to consider the relative strength of the Canadian dollar when developing export strategies. Media producer need to understand the implication of RSS feed technology as teenagers and young adult increasingly seek to customize information and entertainment products accessed via the internet.
* The external environment also includes detailed **cnosumer analysis**. We will be examining these issues in much more detail in Chapter 5 and 6, but this is where you would look for **trends, issues, or considerations with respect to changing consumer segment, segment profiles, and segment sizes**. While socio-cultural trends are more general across society, consumer analysis is focused on understanding specific market segment. **For example, Mega Bloks would need to understand the extent to which "North American" products are perceived positively among consumers in key Japanese market segments.**
*  The external environment also includes industry analysis. Industry considerations might include factors like **industry size and competitiveness, industry structure, industry dynamics (trends, norms, etc), stage of the product life cycle (see Chapter 8), and industry key success factors.** Again, we are just looking for factors that might positively or negatively impact our strategic decisions. **For example, a new entrant into the computer printer industry should understand that manufacturers make little, if any, money on selling the printers, but make significant margins selling ink.**
* Finally, we give consideraiton to **competitive analysis--identifying the key competitors, understanding their strategies and strengths and weaknesses, as well as anticipating likely future strategic changes. Mega Bloks, for example, need to understand and anticipate Lego's marketing strategy in Japan, as well as the strategies of domestic competitors to make an informed market-entry decision.**
* When conducting this situational analysis, **marketers focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of the environment in which they are competing**. This includes a solid understanding of their own organization and its abilities to create value and compete effectively. As illustrated below, **the internal environment is all the controllable elements inside an organization that understand the current strategy of the organization and assess how well that strategy is working: How superior is the current value created by the firm's product. How effective is the current marketing mix? What is the relative market share of these products? What has been their financial performance? Marketers also need to understand the resources and competencies of the organization; its technology, intellectual capital, and other assets. For example, firms need to have appropriate technical skills to compete in their industry. Their employees need to have appropriate skills, abilities, and training to produce the firm's products. A firm's physical facilities can be an important asset for creating customer value, as can its level of financial stability, its relationships with suppliers and channel members, its corporate reputation, and its ownership of strong brands in the marketplace. Marketers also need to understand the organization of the firm--its structure, culture, and system (how they get work done). Some firms, for example, have a positive work climate that encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. Other firms find they have a "chilly" climate, characterized by negativity, work-to-rule, and in-fighting among employees--which can seriously affect product quality and relationship with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders. Finally the belief, value, and preference of senior management in an organization need to be understood for marketers to consider organization-appropriate alternatives in making key marketing decisions.**

#### Step 3: Set Organizational or SBU Objective
* After constructing a mission statement and understanding the decision environment, top management sets organizational or strategic business unit (SBU) objectives. Very large corporations are normally divided into self-contained divisions, or SBU. Bombardier, for example, produces transportation vehicles ranging from commercial aircraft to high-speed trains, with each product class organized in an SBU. Bombardier Learjet is an SBU of Bombardier. Bombardier Learjet operates as an independent busienss with its own mission and objectives--and its own marketing strategy. Organization and SBU objectives are a direct outgrowth of the mission statement and broadly identify what the ifrm hopes to accomplish within the general time frame of the firm's long-range business plan.
* To be effective, objectives need to be specific, measurable (so firms can tell whether they've met them or not) and attainable. Attainability is especially important--firms that establish "pie in the sky" objectives they can't realistically obtain can create frustration for their employee (who work hard but get no satisfaction of accomplishment) and other stakeholders in the firm, such as vendors and shareholders who are affected when the firm doesn't meet its objectives.
* Objectives may related to **revenue and sales, profibility, the firm's standing in the market, return on investment, productivity, product development, customer relation and satisfaction, and social responsibility.** To ensure measurability, objectives are often stated in numerical terms. For example, a firm might have as an objective a 10 percent increase in profitability. It could reach this objective by increasing productivity, by reducing costs, or by selling off an unprofitable division. Or it might meet this 10 percent objective by developing new products, investing in new technologies, or entering a new market. If you are a business major, you will learn a lot more about setting and specifying objectives in your organizational behavior and business strategy courses.

#### Step 4: Establish the Business Portfolio
* For companies with several different SBU, strategic planning includes making decisionss about how to best allocate resources across these businesses to ensure growth for the total organization. Each SBU has its own focus within the firm's overall strategic plan, and each has its own target market and strategies for reaching its objectives. Just like an independent business, each SBU is a separate profit centre within the larger corporation--that is, each SBU within the firm is responsible for its own costs, revenues, and profits.
* Just as the collection of different stocks an investor owns is called a portfolio, the range of different businesses that a large firm operates is called its business portfolio. As with the Bombardier example, these different busiensses usually represent very different product lines, each of which operates with its own budget and management. Having a diversified business portfolio reduces the firm's dependence on one product line or one group of customers. For example, if travel suffers and Disney has a bad year in theme-park attendance and cruises, its managers hope that the lost sales will be made up by stay-at-homers who go to Disney movies and watch Disney's television networks. There are a variety of portfolio analysis tools available to marketers to help them decide which mix of business units makes most sense in their context, but the use of these tools is typically addressed in a marketing strategy course, and is beyond the scope of this text.

#### Step 5: Develop Growth Strategies
* Although portfolio analysis tools can help managers decide which SBU they should invest in for growth, it doesn't tell them much about how to make that growth happen. Should the growth of an SBU come from finding new customers, from developing new variations of the product, or from some other growth strategy? Part of teh strategic planning at the SBU level entails evaluating growth strategies.
* Marketing penetraion strategies (**Existing products, existing markets**) seek to increase sales of existing products to existing markets such as current users, nonusers, and users of competing brands within a market. For example, Cambell's can advertise new uses for soup in lunches and dinners, encourage current customers to eat more soup, and prod nonusers to find reasons to buy soup. The firm might try to increase sales by cutting prices, improving distribution, or conducting promotions aimed at attracting users of competing soup brands.
* Market development strategies (**Existing Products, new markets**) introduce existing products to new markets. This strategy can mean expanding into a new geographic area, or it may mean reaching new customer segments within an existing geographic market. For example, Red Bull, the "energy" drink that had its beginnings in the 1990s as a cult favorite among the merging young club crowd, is trying to move up the generational chain to attract older users as well. To do this, Red Bull has recently migrated some of its marketing efforts from edgy ads to mainstream messages. Founder and largest shareholder Dietrich Mateschitz understands the dollar power of the older generation, and to appeal to them he has broadened Red Bull's distribution into stores, restaurants, and clubs they frequent. Mateschitz is betting on the vast numbers of clubbers' parents to prop up sales, especially now that the heavyweights like Coca-Cola, pepsiCo, and Anheuser-Busch are trying to make inroads in to the market for energy drinks.
* Product development strategies (**New Products, Existing Markets**) create growth by selling new products in existing markets. Product development may mean extending the firm's product line by developing new variations of the item, or it may mean altering or improving the product to provide enhanced performance. Take the humble mattress, for example. Lately, busienss-class hotels like Sheraton and Marriott have been engaged in something of a "mattress war"--that is, each one is trying to convince the traveller that its bed is softer, mroe comfortable, and more inviting than the competition's (and in some cases, if you fall in love with the bed you can actually buy it and take it home). This "sleeper" strategy appears to be effective: Radisson Hotels' research with guests told it that the mere fact that a bed was "upgraded" would allow the chain to charge an additional $10 per room. These new age beds carry their own brand name-- "Heavenly Bed" at Westin, "The Revive Collection" at Marriott, and "Sweet Sleeper" at Sherraton. Radisson's "Sleeper Number" beds even allow each occupant to adjust the firmness of his or her side with a remote control device. A product development strategy like that is waking up the hotel industry, as the major players (and some smaller luxury hotels) and now scrambling to merchadinse other room elements, such as toiletries.
* Diversification strategies (**New Product, New Markets**) emphasize both new products and new markets to achieve growth. After a long period of sluggish performance in the fast food market, McDonald's has re-energized itself over the past several years through successful strategic planning. For example, feeling that it was maxing out in the hamburger business in the late 1990, McDonald's sought to attract different customers with lines of business to diversify its portfolio of food offerings. Among those are Donatos Pizza, Boston Market, and a controlling interest in Chipotle Mexican Grills. Interestingly, now that its core business is back on track, McDonald's has begun to divest some of these other brands and is shifting from diversification back to more of a product development strategy around the core McDonald's brand.

### The Marketing Planning Process
* Marketing plannings uses the output of the strategic planning process as an input--that is, **the strategic planning process provides the context in which marketing planning is conducted.** Solid planning means that a firm has a viable product at a price consumers are willing to pay, the means to get that product to the place consumers want it, and a way to communicate (promote) the product to the right consumers. The marketing planning process culminates in the development of a formal document called the **marketing plan**. Although we will discuss the process of developing a marketing plan in great detail in Chapter 14, let us briefly examine the marketing plan template shown below.

#### Understand the Opportunity
* The marketing planning process begins with a thorough analysis of the decision context facing the firm. The situational analysis conducted for the strategic plan is reviewed and updated and any constraints, assumptions, or other decision parameters that need to be taken into consideration are identified. A strategic assessment of the situation is then conducted to identify the key facts, factors, or observations in the external and internal environments that have the most immportant implications or bearing on the marketing planning. Some environmental considerations are more important to understand than others. For example, Mega Bloks might choose to enter the Japanese market differently if it were able to get patent protection on its building blocks. Richard Hill, at yellow Point Lodge, need to find a strategy consistent with the strong sense of history and tradition of his long-loyal customers. The challenge is in identifying the most important considerations on which to base your marketing strategy.
* **SOT analysis** is one tool often used by marketers (and other planners) in this task. SWOT analysis seeks to identify meaningful strengths and weakness in the organization's internal environment, and opportunities and threats from the external environment. In conducting a SWOT analysis and try to identify the immplications of each of these considerations. For each fact or observation, ask yourself: **why is it important to understand this information? How does it impact a decision that I need to make? Is it a strength of my organization that will help me create superior customer value or defend my desired positioning, or is it a weakness that undermines that ability and would need to be addressed or mitigated (reduce in effect)? Is it an opportunity in the external environment that my organization could exploit or take advantage of in creating or defending value creation or is it a threat that impedes or otherwise limits my organization's ability to compete effectively?**
* If the implication does not have a direct bearing on a decision you have to make, it probably isn't very important and does not need to be included in the SWOT analysis. Determining the strategic implications and what is important and not important can take many years of experience--and you have to practice doing SWOT analysis to gain that experience. However, marketing and business strategy research has found that there are six basic reasons why some organizations fail. These six "fatal flaws" can help you identify some of t he environmental factors that are particularly important to understand and need either to be addressed or mitigated when developing your marketing strategy:
1. Failure to innovate: no differentiation. Organizations that do not create offers that are superior in some way to those already available usually do not survive very long. Lack of differentiation and the inability to create and defend sustainable competitive advantage is a strategic issue that can be observed in an organization's current strategy relative to its competitive environment.
2. Failure to create value: There is no a large enough market segment that wants a particular offer. Sometimes the current strategy of an organization does not create sufficient customer value to attract customers. Insufficient value creation is a strategic issue that is sometimes observed in an analysis of an organization's current strategy relative to segment profile analysis.
3. Failure to persist over time: insufficent margins, volume, or resources. Often related to the failure to create value, but also sometimes realted to the inability to communicate that value. Some organizations are not able to make sufficient margins or generate sufficient sales volume. Many startup organizations fail because they do not have the financial, technical, human, or management resources to compete effectively over time. This is particularly true of busienss with high fixed costs (those that require significant investment in buildings, equipment, people, technology, or overhead--such as software creation or car manufacturing) because it can take many months or years to recover those initial investments. More established organization can fail because their markets change over time: competition increases, demand decreases, or they can't or don't keep up with changing technology. The inability to compete effectively is an important strategic issue that can be observed in both the internal and external environment.
4. Failure to maintain economic scarcity. Offers are imitable or substitutable. Some organizations fail to protect the value they have created and competitiors are able to better satisfy customer demand with similar offers or substitutes. Organizations that are unable to limit direct competition **by means of intellectual property protection; strong supplier, distributor, or customer relationships; cost structure advantages 9such as economic of scale); switching costs; unique knowledge; greater customization or niche (small market) focus; strong brand name; or somme other market entry barrier**, may not be able to defend their positioning
5. Failure to prevent "appropriation" of value: hold-up or slack. Some organizations get held hostage (held up) by stakeholders in strong bargaining positions, such as strong unions, single source supplier, or key distributors. These stakeholders are able to negotiate terms that erode the profitability of the organization. Hold-up issues might be evident in an industry or competitive analysis. Other organizations are wasteful or inefficient with their resources(slack)--often because the management team does not have sufficient experience in that industry to be effective. This might be evident in an analysis of the organization structure, systems, and culture or the current strategy and performance.
6. Failure to be flexible and adapt: the ability to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty is being able to anticipate events, but not their timing. For example, a chicken satay vendor could anticipate that at some point in time, despite their best food safety efforts, a customer will get food poisoning from eating t he chicken. Effective organizations create risk management plans, crisis management plans, and have insurance and other "due diligence" interventions to limit the impact of potential risks--but in highly volatile, fast-changing industries (like fashion or biotechnology) this can be difficult to do. But some event can not even be anticipated (such as terrorist attacks, currency devaluations, or stock crashes) and managers need to be capable of adapting to changin circumstances. The degree of uncertainty is often assessed in an industry analysis, and the inability of management to plan or adapt could be an issue in an assessment of an organization's management and systems.


* Marketers use SWOT analysis to help them make strategic and tactical decisions. Internal strengths and external opportunities provide rationale to support a particular course of action. Internal weaknesses and external threats provide reasons why a particular course of action might not be appropriate. Weaknesses and threats, however, are not absolute; both can be addressed or mitigated through marketing strategy. Meal Exchange, for example, is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to motivating post-secondary students to increase their involvement in fighting social problems like hunger (www.mealexchange.com). The organization works with colleges and universities so that students can donate the unused money on their meal cards to local food banks, which could then purchase food for those in need. Differences in college and university policies regarding the redemption of meal cards might be a threat in the external environment of Meal Exchange that could limit expansion plans for the organization. However, this threat might be mitigated or overcome by supporters of the Meal Exchange concpet lobbying college and university administrators to change thier policies so  that they could participate in the Meal Exchange program.
* The key to SWOT analysis is not to get bogged down in analysis paralysis. Firms face hundreds, if not thousands, of internal and external environmental considerations that shape and impact their business. You will want to identify the top six to ten issues that might have the greatest implication for the marketing decisions you have to make. Ask yourself: Does this fact or piece of information have a major implication for a decision I have to make? If not, it's probably not worth documenting in a SWOT analysis. A SWOT summary is a list of the most important issues and their implications, such as those shown below, which is an illustrative example of a SWOT analysis summary for the decision faced by Michel Bendayan at Mega Bloks.

        ### Illustrative SWOT Summary for Mega Bloks ###
        Internal Environment:
        Current Strategy & Performance
                --World market-share leader in preschool segment (S)
                * Ability to leverage international brand name in new markets
                --Weak sales and lack of distribution network (W)
                * Status quo not really an option, market may require unique strategy
        Organization (structure, system, culture)
                --Asia, Australia, and Africa are all under one international marketing director (W)
                * May limit ability to focus on Japan and customize Japanese lines
                --Product innovation culture (S)
                * Ability to compete on innovative new product development
                --Rapid growth in past five years (S,W)
                * Has gained significatn international experience that supports its ability to enter the Japanese market
                * But hard to maintain focus and organizational culture with such growth, high degree of Japanese customization may be difficult to implement
        Resource & Competencies
                --Second largest construction block company in the world (after Lego) (S)
                * Has the experience and resources needed for international expansion
                --3000 employees, 75 to 100 product lines, in 100 countries (S)
                * has the people, expertise, and resources to develop custom product lines
                --Basic product not patentable--Leog had a patent (now expired) (W)
        Management Preferences & Values
                --Standardized products are preferable (inferred) (?)
                * Mega Bloks has not previously customized products for a single country, doing so may create a precedent for a wholesale change in strategy that has significatn cost implications. It might be possible to do it for one country but maybe not for all countries.

        External Environment:
        Macro (General) Environment: PESTO
                --American products are often considered prestige products in Japan (O)
                * May be value in offering North American-style product lines
                --High quality consciousness in Japanese society (T)
                * May need greater control over the supply chain
                --Greater awareness and importance of pop culture (T)
                * May need japanese brand personality
        Consumer Analysis
                --Japanese consumers strongly nationalistic (T)
                * Prefer Japanese look and feel
                --Japanese houses are much smaller than those in North America or even Europe (T)
                * Will likely require different packaging, but also maybe different product lines that enable blocks to be used for many designs


#### Objectives
* **Based on the situational analysis, the business then develops a set of marketing objectives.** These are more specific than the SBU objectives, and achieving the marketing objectives helps an organization achieve the overall SBU objectives. **Marketing objectives normally include one or more sales objectives. After all, without sales, there are no profits, and without profits, there is no business.** Some example of sales objectives are: "To increase sales of our deluxe model toy by 15 percent during the next 12 months","To sell one million toys during the holiday season".
* **If a firm has decided that its growth strategy is to focus on product development--new or improved products for existing customers--it will develop product objectives. Because it is more profitable to retain customers than it is to replace them, firms often set objectives for improvements in quality or service to develop customer loyalty. In the breakfast cereal market, where consumers are more fickle than loyal, firms like Kellogg and General Mills may set objectives for developing new brands to suit the tastes of everyone--children, teens, adults--or they may set goals for a new product to retain customers who are being lured away by a comeptitor's new honey coated, fruit-and-fibre cereal. In other cases, a firm may decide to modify a product by taking advantage of trends, as when Frito-Lay developed its line of "lite" snacks.**
* **In some instances, firms find that their best opportunities for growth are stated in the form of market objectives. These goals can involve entering new markets or increasing product usage in served market, through using either market development strategies (existing product sold to new customers) or diversification strategies (new products for new customers)** Manufacturers of recreational vehicles (motor homes and travel trailers), for example, used a market development strategy in targeting baby boomers. Joining together in a "Go RVing Coalition", they spent US$ 15 million on advertising aimed at this under 50 market in a three-year period".

#### Marketing Strategy: Specifying the Value
Once the marketing and other objectives are developed, the organization develops a marketing strategy aimed at achieving those objectives. As was discussed briefly in Chapter 1, **marketing strategy begins with idetnfiying, profiling, and selecting market segments that will be targeted by the strategy. As will be discussed in mroe detail in Chapter 3, choosing the right market to compete in and the right customer to attract is a critical task for a marketer; a task that combines both art and science.** Once the target market customers have been chosen, marketing strategy focuses on teh positioning issues of **strategic orientation, differentiation, defendability, and brand personality**.
* **Strategic orientation** is a discussion of **how the organization will compete in its chosen market(s)**. This would include a discussion of growth strategies (as per above); customer value creation strategy (Chapter 1); or other strategy concepts that you will learn if you take another marketing course. **Your SWOT analysis is another source of strategy alternatives.** The SWOT strategy Matrix in Figure below illustrates how you can develop strategy alternatives by **considering how to utilize your strengths or address your weaknesses to take advantage of opportunities, and how to address or mitigate threats in the external environment.**



                           Strengths                                            Weaknesses

        Opportunity        SO(1)                                                  WO(2)



        Threats         ST(3)                                                     WT(4)

        * SO(1): utilize strengths to take advantage of opportunity: Utilize strong international experience, international brand name, and economies of scale to take advantage of the opportunity that North American brands are valued to Japan

        * WO(2): Address weakness to take advantage of opportunity: Address this weakness that the product is not patentable, and take advantage of the large Japanese market opportunity by developing a fully customized Japanese product line and brand personality. This will discourage local competition.

        * ST(3): Utilize strength to address or mitigate threats: Utilize product innovation culture to develop a line of flexible use, small package products that address the space limitations of the Japanese market, then utilize international experience and channels to sell this line in Europe

        * ST(4): Address weaknesses to address or mitigate threats: Hire japanese sales representatives to develop their own distribution network in Japan, and utilize this network to address the threat of Japanese retailers being more relationship oriented. Consider partnering in this endeavour with a large retailer to limit strategic exposure with japanese toy manufacturers.





* **Differentiation is how a brand will be known to its customers as being better than competitive brands.** A discussion of differentiation should be specific. It is not meaningful to say that an organization will differentiate itself on quality. **What does that mean in your specific context? For a car it could mean greater reliability, durability, longevity, rust protection, or more comfortable seats, among many other considerations. For a restaurant it could mean better taste, greater variety, better ingredients, faster service, or better ambiance, among other considerations. You need to be specific in identifying what your organization will do better than others.**
* Defendability discusses sources of **sustainable competitive advantage and the systems, competencies, technology, or other resources that enable an organization to defend its chosen positioning.** it is important to understand that the underlying goal of all marketing strategies and plans is to create a competitive advantage for the firm--to take what the company does really well and outperform the competition, thus providing customers with a benefit the competition can not provide. A competitive advantage gives consumers a reason to choose one product over another again and again.
* Finally, brand personality is a discussion of how the intended differentiation will be captured in the creation of brand meaning. Some brands, like the Apple Macintosh, have clear personalities. Imagine that Apple Macintosh was a person and he or she just walk into the room. Describe him or her in as much detail as possible. You can do that quite easily because Apple has spent considerable money developing the mac Guy versus PC Guy series or advertisements (which can be found on its website: www.apple.com). In defining a brand personality we specify what personality we are seeking to support the overall positioning of the brand. This personality gets developed in the marketing mix decisions that we subsequently make.

#### marketing Mix: Create the Value
* As outlined in Chapter 1, a mareting plan then describes the marketing mix decision related to product, price, channel of distribution, and marketing communication. Rationale for these decisions come from your SWOT and other analysis, your understanding of your target market profile, and the marketing theory, principles, and concepts that you will learn from reading this text and attending class.

#### Evaluation and Implementation
* Also as outlined in Chapter 1, **the collective decisions represented in a marketing plan need to be evaluated to determine if the strategy should be implemented.** **Throughout the writting of a marketing plan, rationale is provided for each decision made using your situational analysis, target market profile, and marketing theory, concepts, and principles**. Collectively, however, the set of decisions need to create superior customer value and achieve the organization's objectives, and marketers need to be confident that they have devised the most appropriate strategy given their circumstances. To make the overall recommendation to implement the marketing plan, financial analysis and cost-benefit analysis are required. Financial analysis involves developing projected (pro-forma) financial statements, such as a pro-forma income statement and balance sheet, and sometimes a cash flow statement or a statement of sources and uses of funds. Financial analysis might also include ratio analysis--a comparison of key figures in the financial statements. 
* Cost-benefit analyseis, as the name implies, is an analysis of all the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a partciular course of action. Simple cost-benefit analysis involves a judgment-based (qualitative) assessment of the net benefit (advanatges relate to disadvantages) of one course of action relative to alternatives. More sophisticated cost-benefit analysis involves assigning numerical values to (qualifying) the costs and benefits and then using a decision rule of formulae to calculate the net benefit of each alternative. This more sophisticated approach allows the analyst to assign different levels of importance (weights) to different costs and benefits, but it can sometimes be very difficult to assign a numerical value to some costs and benefits. For example, how might a reasonable numeric value be assigned to the potential loss of life from a poorly designed child's toy, or the potential damage to an ecosystem from batteries that are not recycled?
* Finally, if all of the above-metnioned analyses lead to a positive recommendation to implement a particular strategy, a marketing plan then outlines how the strategy will be implemented, including action plans for the marketing mix elements; responsibilities and time lines (who is going to do what, by when); the budget and how the budget will be allocated by activity; and plans to monitor and measure the results of the strategy implementation, with contingency plans if benchmarks (targets) are not met. Unless already specified as part of the marketing mix, this section of the plan would also specify how exchange relationships will be initiated and managed. This topic will be explored further in Chapter 5 and 6.
* finally, a marketing plan typically includes a set of exhibits that provide details taht support the recommendations made in the body of the plan. These exhibits include the SWOT analysis, detailed market segment profiles, and a pro-forma income statement that shows the forecast sales volume and revenue and identifies the key expenses, as per the proposed marketing budget. Positioning map (described in Chapter 3) are lso often included to illustrate the relative positioning of an organization's brand(s).

# Chapter 3: Market Segmentation and Positioning

## The Concept of Segmentation
* The goal of the marketer is to satisfy needs, but in our complex society, it is naive to assume that everyone's needs are the same. Michael Shekter and his colleagues at Molson know that different types of consumers have different priorities when it comes to buying beer. So when Molson designs and markets its beverages, it needs to consider the different needs that exist in the marketplace. Understanding these needs is especially complex today, because technological and cultural advances have created a condition of market fragmentation. **Market fragmentation occurs when people's diverse interests and backgrounds have divided them into different groups with distinct needs and wants. Because of this diversity, the same product or service will not appeal to everyone.**
* Consider, for example, the effects of fragmentation in the fast-food industry. When a McDonald's hamburger was still a novelty (with under a million sold), people were happy to order just a plain hamburger, fries, and drink. Today's consumers would be very unhappy if salads, children, or wraps disappeared from the menu. But how many menu items do McDonald's, Harvey's, or Pizza Hut need to offer? Why is it that kids insist on a Happy Meal, whereas their parents prefer t o grab a pita at Wendy's or a veggie burger at Harvey's?
* At one time, it was sufficient to divide the sports shoe market into athletes and non-athletes. Today, a walk through any sporting goods store will reveal that the athlete market has fragmented in many directions, and includes shoes designed for jogging, basketball, tennis, cycling, cross-training, and skateboarding. Some manufacturers of athletic footwear geared to young boraders, such as Vans, Airwalk, and DC Shoes, chalked up annual sales gains of 20 to 50 percent in the past few years. Known to their peers as shredders, riders, or skaters, the youth who wear these shoes can be seen riding skateboards down the handrails and steps of city parks, and riding rails or doing jumps on snowboards, stunt bikes, or wakeboards. Over the next few years, sport marketers expect the skateboard and snowboard populations to double and wakeboarders to soar sixfold. To cash in on this trend, PepsiCo Inc.'s Mountain Dew began to feature snowboarding in its advertisements and was rewarded with a hefty increase in sales.
* Instead of trying to sell the same thing to all customers, **marketers often select a target marketing strategy, in which they divide the total market into different segments based on customer characteristics, select one or more segments, and develop products to meet the needs of those specific segments. The five-step process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning is illustrated below.

                1. Select Market: a. Define your market; b. Understand customers: needs and wants; benefits, features, and attributes sought; and purchase and consumption behaviour.

                2. Market Segmentation: a. Identify groups: geographic, behavioural, psychographic, and demographic segmentation; b. Describe (profile) the groups: who, what, when, where, why

                3. Market Targeting: a. Evaluate segment attractiveness: size, growth; strategic, fit, competitive or comparative advantage; level of commpetition, defendability; b. Decide which one(s) to target

                4. Market Positioning: Decide how you want to compete, be differentiated, and be known for value creation in the minds of consumers

                5. Create and Execute Marketing Mix Programs

* Understanding customers will be discussed in Chapter 4,5,6. The creation of marketing mix programs is discussed in Chapter 7 through 13. Our focus here is on segmentation, targeting, and positioning.
* **Segmentation is the process of dividing a larger market into subgroups, where within groups people have fairly homogeneous needs and wants and where between groups people have sufficiently different needs and wants that they would be interested in very different product solutions or marketing programs.** Because consumers have different needs and wants and the same marketing program is unlikely to appeal to all consumers, marketers identify the key groups in a market, choose which group(s) to focus on (target), decide how they want their brand to compete and be known by these consumers (positioning), and design marketing programs (make marketing mix decisions) to create product offers that uniquely appeal to the chosen target groups. There are very few, if any, products with universal appeal. Even for products as popular as cola soft drinks, some consumers prefer Coca-Cola over Pepsi, some prefer Pepsi over Coke, some prefer diet colas, some prefer flavoured colas, and others prefer non-soft drink beverages. Theresa Bergeron, president of Thermohair Inc., has developed a product line of specialty socks made of kid (baby goat) mohair. Not everyone would be interested in a $25 pair of durable, warm, comfortable socks, but people involved in outdoor recreational sports like hiking and camping might be.

## Select and Segmenting a Market
* **One of the challenges in developing a marketing strategy is determining what market you are in and what market you should be segmenting.** For example, should Michael Shekter at Molson be segmenting the beer market, the alcoholic beverage market, or the social beverage market? Kodak redefined itself from being in the film business to being in the imaging business--leading Kodak to venture into new markets. Deciding what "market" you are competing in has significant implications for the segments you might identify. **You must also consider the geographic scope of the market--are you segmenting the beverage market in North America, Canada, or one or more provinces?** The decision about how to define the markets you are competing in **is typically done at the executive (strategic planning) level of an organization**. As an entrepreneur or consultant, you may need to make this decision yourself--**based on your experience, your understanding of the consumer, competitive, and technological environments, and your understanding of the mission, strategic directions, and competencies of your organization.**
* CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING MARKET SEGMENTS: **Before discussing how to segment a market, let's review the criteria for a successful segmentation scheme. There is no right or wrong way to segment a market, but some segmentation schemes are more useful than others for identifying market opportunities and being able to position products that uniquely appeal to a well-defined group of consumers or customers--the term used to describe organizational or business-to-business buyers.**
1. **Members of teh segment must be similar to each other in their product needs and wants such that the same marketing programs (product offers) would be appealing to most members of the group.**
2. **At the same time, consumers in each segment should be sufficiently different from consumers in other segments that different marketing programs or product offers would be appealing to the different segments.** Segment differences need to be **actionable**--that is, **they require different product, pricing, distribution, and/or communication strategies to create aproduct offer that appeal to each segment**. Without real differences in consumer needs and wants, firms might as well use a mass-marketing strategy. For example, it's a waste of time to develop two separate lines of skin care products for working and non-working women, if both segments have the same needs and wants with respect to skin care.
3. **The segment must be large enough now and in the future to warrant targeting**. What is large enough is a judgment call, and usually depends on the size of the company doing the segmentation scheme. large organizations like proctor & Gamble may be interested only in market segments with sales potential in the millions of dollars. A smaller company may be interested in segments with sales potential in teh tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. In considering the B.C market, for example, the Beef Information Centre evaluated the Chinese Canadian community as a possible segment. Chinese Canadians spend more money on food than any other ethnic group, and if just 25 percent of the close to 300,000 Chinese Canadians in British Columbia ate one more beef meal a month, sales of beef in British Columbia would increase by 77,000 kilograms per year. This analysis led the organization to target the Chinese Canadian segment in Vancouver through magazine ads, recipes distributed at grocery stores, and the sponsorship of a Chinese cooking show on TV.
4. The segment must represent a measurable market--that is, people in the segment have purchasing power: the authority, willingness, and ability to make a purchase decision. Children, for example, may not have the authority to make a purchase. Religious or cultural beliefs may impact willingness t o buy(such as beef-based hamburgers in India). Low-income consumers may not have the ability to buy.
5. Finally, the segment must be reachable. Marketers must be able to identify consumers or organizational customers in the segment and communicate the product offer to them in a cost-effective manner. It is easy to select television programs or magazines that will efficiently reach older consumers, consumers with specific levels of education, certain ethnic groups, or residents of major cities, because the media they prefer are easy to identify. It is unlikely, however, that marketing communications can reach only lef-handed blond people with tattoos who listen to hip-hop. Therefore, it may no make sense to target that segment

## The Process of Segmentation
* Segmentation is the central tenet of cornerstone of marketing strategy. Not all consumers of business market customers want the same things, and marketers have to decide which consumers or customers they are going to focus on to create an appealing product-offer. Several segmentation variables, or bases for segmentation, can be used to group consumers into actionable segments. For example, consider the sports shoe industry. Some sports, such as running, are more popular in some provinces than others, so marketers consider geography. Not everyone is willing or able to pay $150 for the latest running shoe, so marketers consider disposable and discretionary income. Men may be more likely to participate in some sports, such as basketball, whereas women may be more likely than men to want the latest aerobic styles, so marketers also consider gender. Not all age groups are going to be equally interested in buying specialized athletic shoes, and some kids may be more inclined to "extreme" sports than others. As this example shoes, the larger consumer "pie" can be sliced into smaller pieces in a number of ways, **including geographic, demographic, psychological, and behavioural difference**. These segmentation variables are used to identify the groups, and then create descriptions or profiles of the groups. So, just how do marketers segment a population? The process is similar for organizational (business-to-business) markets, and will discuss some of the difference shortly.

### Behavioural Segmentation
* Savvy marketers realize that if the objective is to create groups that want very different product offers, it makes sense to try to group them by the similarity of their needs, wants, and preferences, the benefits they seek, the features and attributes they desire, or their purchasing or consumption behaviour. This approach to segmentation is called behavioural segmentation, and marketers such as Palm and McDonald's have found it useful place to start because it identifies groups that require distinct marketing programs. Recent research by Digital Consumer Projects in New York suggests that online individual behaviour matters more than the demographics of an individual, finding seven behavioural segments that include "surfers", "loiterers", and "quickies".
* Behavioural segmentation divides consumers on the basis of how they act toward, feel about, or use a product or service. **Benefit segmentation, or value segmentation, is a powerful behavioural segmentation appraoch where consumers are grouped by the benefits they seek in a product category**. For example, Peachtree Network, a company that operated online grocery stores across Canada, originally segmented its market into three benefit segments: busy people, people with mobility difficulties, and people who liked and were motivated to use the technology behind the service. In many industries, consumers seek different types of benefits from products and can be grouped accordingly. For example, the following benefit-based groups might be identified (among others) as restaurant industry segments: convenience seekers, fun seekers, health-oriented, fine-dining oriented, family-oriented, image- or status- oriented, or culture seekers. Each of us may fall into more than one of these benefit-seeking categories at different times or in different contexts, but restauratn owners know that different consumers seek different benefits from a restaurant and select restaurants based on the benefits they wish to receive at a particular time. That is why restaurants are usually clearly positioned to appeal to one or more of these benefit segment groups. Think of all the restaurants you know: What benefit(s) do they primarily focus on delivering? The advantage of segmenting by benefits is that the resulting groups are usually seeking very different product solution, which makes the segmentation scheme very actionable in terms of designing appropriate marketing program.
* Another comkmon approach to behavioural segmentation is **product usage segmentation**. In this approach, **groups are identified based on how they use a product or how much they use a product.** Baking soda, for example, is marketered to a variety of en-use segments, including deodorizing fridges, sinks, or rugs; cooking; and teeth brushing. Airlines often identify consumer and business traveller segments, which is a proxy for describing the frequency of product use (light users versus heavy users) and how they use the service. Many marketers (particularly those in business-to-business markets) abide by a rule of thumb called the 80/20 rule: 20 percent of purchasers account for 80% of the product's sales (this ratio is just an approximation). **Therefore, it often makes more sense to focus on the smaller number of people who are beavy users of a product rather than on the larger number who are just casual users.** Kraft Foods began an advertising campaign to remind its core users to not "skip the zip" after its research showed that, indeed, 20 percent of households account for 80 percent of the usage of Miracle Whip. These heavy users consume about 8 kilograms of Miracle Whip a year!
* While the 80/20 rule still generally holds in the marjority of situations, the Internet's ability to offer an unlimited choice of goods to billions of people is starting to change how marketers think about segmentation. **A new approach called the long tail is turning traditional thinking about the virtues of selling in high volume on its head. The basic idea is that we no longer need to rely solely on the big hits (like blockbuster movies or bestselling books) to find profits. Companies can also make money by selling small amounts of items that only a few people want--if they sell enough different items.** For example, Amazon.com maintains an inventory of 3.7 million books compared to the 100,000 or so you'll find at a Chapters retail store. Most of these will sell only a few thousand copies (if that), but the 3.6 million books that Chapters doesn't carry make up a quarter of Amazon's revenue! Similarly, about a fifth of the videos Netflix delivers to its customers are older or obscure titles that Blockbuster does not stock. Other examples of long tail include successful microbreweries and TV channels that make money on reruns of old shows.
* **Some marketers find it useful to divide the market into users and non-users of a good or service so that they can reward current users (as Air Canada does with frequent flyer miles) or try to win over new ones.** However, non-users are often not clearly identifieable and reachable, thus failing to satisfy the fifth criterion for identifying market segment outlined above. And current users may not be a very homogeneous group, which is the first criterion, and **they may not reflect the users desired by the marketing organization.**
* **Another way to segment a market based on behaviour is to look at usuage occasions, or the context in which consumers use the product most. Many products are associated with specific occasions, including time of day and holidays, whether for a business function or casual situation. Greeting cards, for example, are a product associated with specific occasions. Carlton cards, Canada's leading greeting card marketer, experiences peak demand related to four special occasions: Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Easter. In addtion to meeting the demand for these occasions with specialized cards, advertising, and in-store promotions, Carlton engages in marketing efforts designed to encourage the giving of cards on other occasions, such as Earth Day.** Similarly, ski resorts like Mont Tremblant, which experience heavy demand during vacation periods, might offer great bargains during the off-season to tempt vacationers who would otherwise jsut visit the resort during Christmas vacation.
* Being strongly associated with an occasion can be a mixed blessing for a product. **On the one hand, sales can be almost guranteed at that time (think about how many people cook a whole turkey on Thanskgiving); on the other hand, a product can become locked into an occasion (few people cook whole turkeys as a standard menu item). For the past 10 years, Ocean Spray has worked hard to expand cranberry consumption beyond the holiday seaon, introducing new cranberry foods like Craisin Sweetened Dried Cranberries, spritzers, and cranberry-based beverages. Now it's trying to increase consumption frequncy by communicating the health benefits of its products and encouraging consumers to take the Ocean Spray Cranberry Cocktail "One Glass A Day Challenge".**

### Segmenting by Psychographics
* Consumers and customers often **make purchase decisions that reflect or support their attitudes, values, interests, opinions, emotions, personality, and lifestyles**. Collectively these concepts are discussed further in Chapter 5. Psychographic segmentation group consumers by these and other variables related to an individual's psychology, mental state, or self and is concerned with t he motivation for consumers to buy products. As we will se in Chapter 5, marketers not only seek to understand **how consumers behave but also how they think and feel about products, what motivates them, how they learn, and how they make purchase decision.**
* Grouping consumers by their psychological orientation to a purchase often results in a useful segmentation scheme that meets the criteria below, since difference in these psychological considerations usually reflect differences in needs and wants and are precursors to purchase and consumption behaviour. For example, Covenant House, a charitable organization that helps homeless people, **recognized that donors care more about the homeless than non-donors care more about the homeless than non-donors do, and believe their donations will make a difference**. With this understanding, Taxi Advertising and Design of Toronto developed a series of highly effective (and award-winning) campaign elements to increase the number of people who care about the homeless, thus increasing the pool of potential donors. One showed black and white images of homeless people sitting alone on the ground in a transit shelter, replaced by images of young children in the same position, with the tag line, "how old do they have to be before you give a damn?" 

        * Similar Enough within the group
        * Different Enough Between the Groups
        * Large Enough
        * Measurable market
        * Reachable

* Lifestyles are a powerful segmentation variable because they capture a number of behavioural, psychographic, and demographic characteristics that reflect how different groups of people live, what they care about, and how they behave. Think about your high-school experience. Were there cliques or groups of students like Jocks, Nerds, Preppies, Stoners, and other who hung out together, dressed similarly, had similar attitude and values, and behave similarly? You could describe each of those groups in some detail. That's what marketers do. Some advertising agencies and manufacturers develop their own psychographic classifications of consumers, identifying lifestyle segments like Yuppies (young urban professionals), Dinks (dual income, no kids), Shredders (boarders), Granolas (early, environmentally concerned, peaceniks), Metrosexual (urban heterosexual males who are sensitive, well educated, and in t ouch with their feminine side), and others. **Products are communicated to people in these segments by showing how the brand supports or is consistent with a particular lifestyle.** Beer marketers like Molson, for example, **often use lifestyle advertising to demonstrate what your life (or at least social life) would be like if you adopted their particular brand. Similarly, car marketers like Toyota, Mazda, Volvo, Saturn, and Mercedes try to show you a lifestyle that they suggest could be yours if you drive their cars.** The Ford Fusion ad relateds to the Fusion brand to a young, high-energy lifestyle. Web-based services like GeoCities allow people to sort themselves into lifestyle communities based on specific shared interests. Online marketers can then target these specific lifestyle groups. Apple's use of lifestyle segmentation has been particularly effective. Apple positions Mac and iPods as being for people with a young, hip, unconventional outlook on life.
* Other marketers choose to subscribe to larger services that divide the population into segments and sell pieces of this informaiton to clients for specific strategic applications. The most well known of these system is **VALS (Values and Lifestyles)**, developed by SRI International. The original VALS system was based on social values and lifestyles. Today VALS2 is based on psychological traits that correlate with consumers behaviour. It divides people into eight groups based on both psychological characteristics, such as willingness to take risks, and "resources", which include such factors as income, education, energy levels, and eagerness to buy. As shown below, three primary consumer motivations are key to the system: ideals, achievement, and self-expression. **Consumers who are motivated primarily by ideals are guided by knowledge and principlels. Consumers who are motivated primarily by achievement look for goods and services that demonstrate success to their peers. Consumers who are motivated primarily by self-expression desire social or physical activity, variety, and risk.** VALS2 helps match products to particular types of people. For example, VALS2 survey data show that 12 percent of North American adults are Experiencers, who tend to be thirll seekers. VAL2 help Isuzu market its Rodeo sport-utility vehicle by repositioning it to Experiencers, many of whom believe it is fun to break rules (in ways that do not endanger others). The company and its advertising agency repositioned the car as a vehicle that lets a driver break the rules by going off road, using images like kids jumping into mud puddles or purposefully colouring outside the lines to illustrate "rule breaking" Isuzu sales increased significantly after this campaign.
* Marketing researchers can integrate the VALS2 questionaire into custom surveys to identify VALS2 types of repsondents and to correlate their preferences and other behavior with their type. You can find out your VALS2 type by taking their online survey at **www.sric-bi.com**
* VALS is one of the most comprehensive psychographic system available, but because its conslusions are based on residents of the United States, many Canadian firms prefer to use Canadian psychographic systems, such as the one developed by the Environics Research Group (www.environics.net). SKIM

### Segmneting by Demographics
* Demographics are vital for identifying the best potential customers for a product or service because objective cahracteristics like a person's sex or age are (usually) easy to identify and information about the demographics of a consumer market are easily obtained from government sources like Statistics Canada. Demographics are extremely useful in the development of profiles or description of market segment because demographic variables help identify people in segments so that they can be reached with a marketer's communication strategy. **Communications media publish demographic information about their viewers, listeners, or readers to help marketers decide which media are best for reaching which audiences.**
* However, with a few notable exceptions, demographic variables like age, sex, income, family structure, social class, ethnicity, and education **do not usually provide a good starting point or main basis for segmentation because demographic-based segmentation schemes usually do not meet the criterion that the people within each group are similar enough that the same marketing programs (product offers) would be appealing to most members of that group (first criterion)**. For example, one might be tempted to segment the music market by age, suggesting that teenagers may listen to differnt music than people in their twenties, forties, or sixties. While teenagers may be more likely than other age groups to listen to grunge or hip-hop music, not all teens like and listen to this style of music, and there are people in their twentites, thirties, forties, and perhaps even older, who do. By creating age segments we are suggesting that most people in a particular age category have similar needs, wants, preferences, and buying behaviour with respect to music and that they would likely purchase the same or similarly positioned artists or brands, which are different from the artists or brands that consumers in other segments would liekly purchase. If you thought this were true, then age would be an appropriate basis for segmenting the music market. **However, it might make more sense to segment the music market by psychographic variable, such as values, attitudes, interests, opinions, or lifestyles, and then use age and other demographic variables to describe each of the psychographic groups created. This is subtle but important point for creating useful segmentation schemes--demographics are extremely useful for describing market segments and for directing communication messages, but are generally limited as the primary basis for segmentation.**
* *There are some notable exceptions where demographic variables are **related to differences in needs, wants, preferences, and purchase behaviour, and it would make sense to use these variables as the main basis for segmentation***
* **Sex** It makes sense to segment the clothing, fashion, footwear, or fragrance industries by sex, for example, because phsiological and socialization differences between men and women can result in different needs, wants, and preferences. However, men and women may also seek different benefits, features, or attributes, so, in many cases, starting with benefit segmentation would result in a similar segmentation scheme as if starting with sex. **Socialization by sex starts at a very early age and markets need to be responsive to consumer preferences; even diapers come in pink for girls and blue for boys.** As proof that consumers take these differences seriously, market researcher report that most parents refuse to put male infants in pink diapers. Ford Canada recognizes that women and men may have different needs when it comes to purchasing and servicing cars and trucks, which is why the company is now focusing efforts on trying to better understand and serve the needs of Canadian women. Volvo has created a concept car designed by women for women. Similarly, companies such as Home Depot Canada, Marriott Hotels, and Mr. Lube, which have traditionally focused on marketing to men, have started developing products and messages specifically targeting Canadian women. The publisher of What magazine focus on a segment of co-gender lifestyles of Canadian youth, but Fuel, a new entry by Youth Culture (which also publishes Verve for girls), is focused on male teens--its research finding that boys and girls liked and wanted to learn and read about different things. Its biggest hurdle has been convincing advertisers that boys shop, and develop brand loyalty, but for different products than girls. 
* **Age** Consumers in different age groups have very different needs and wants with respect to product categories. Members of a generation tend to share the same outlook and spending priorities, **and these outlooks and priorities change as people age (what you spend your discretionary money on is likely different from what your parents spend their discretionary money on).** However, unless brands specifically relfect these differences in product category needs and wants (such as we saw with What and Fuel magazines), age is less useful for identifying differences in brand preferences than for identifying differences in product category preferences.
* Canadian demographer David Foot has identified several segments of Canadian consumers based on age. These include members of the Baby Boom (those people born in 1947--1966), the Baby Bust (generation x; those born in 1980-1979), the Baby Boom Echo (generation Y; those born in 1980-1995), and Milennium Buster (those born in 1996-2010). While each of these groups of consumers presents needs that some marketers are interested in, **the largest demographic segment in Canada, the baby boomers, accounts for about one-third of the Canadian population and is, therefore, a segment of prime importance to many marketers.** Several companies have achieved success by monitoring the changing needs of this group of consumers. SKIM about baby boomer
* The echo boom (generation Y) comprises the children of the baby boomers. The largest segment of the echo boom are now teens and young adults, who also represent a lucrative group of consumers. The youth market in Canada is estimated to be worth over $13.5 billion, and teens are the second fastest growing segment in Canada.
* They are the first generation to grow up onlin and are more ethnically diverse than earlier generations. These consumers tend to spend their money on items such as clothing, personal grooming, entertainment, sports, and eating out. Montreal-based La Senza has successfully targeted teen and tween (aged 8-14) girls with La Senza Girl store, and banks such as the Royal Band and CIBC have savings programs and debit cards specifically aimed at kids. **VanCity Credit Union recently targeted youth with a banking service "Not for the majority, offering free banking service to anyone under the age of 25. The campaign is backed with a combination of street marketing, web promotions, contests, special events, and a text messaging campaign targeting 5000 youth in Vancouver who had been given cellphones by research company Digital Youth, in exchange for volunteering to receive promotional messages and advertising.**
* The older part of the echo boom, those people born in the early- to mid- 1980, are now in college and universities, or have joined the workforce, and are starting to make major purchases on their own. This college-age group is an important target group for companies like DirectProtect, which sells insurance to students, and brewers such as Moosehead, Molson, and Labatt, who realize that many of the heavy users of their product can be found on campus across Canada.
* In between the baby boomers and the echo boomers are Generation Xers, sometimes labelled busters. **Many of these people have a cynical attitude toward marketing, and most don't have the spending power of boomers or even echo boomers.** However, because baby boomers have taken and held on to the top jobs in the country, **Generation Xers have had to be much more entrepreneurial.** They have been responsible for upwards of 70 percent of the new startup business in North America, As one industry expert observed, today's Gen Xer is both values oriented and value oriented--and this generation is really about settling down. SKIP for teen and parent of baby boomers
* **FAMILY STRUCTURE** Because family needs and expenditures change over time, one way to segment consumers is to consider the stage of the family life cycle they occupy (this will be discussed further in chapter 5). Not suprisingly, consumers in different life cycle segments (such as teens, young adults, married with children, empty nesters) are unlikely to need the same products, or at least in the same quantities. For example, many food companies cater to the needs of people who live alone by providing single-portion forzen and prepared foods, but also offer "jumbo" packs for those people who live in larger households.
* As we age and move into new life situations, different product categories ascend and descend in importance to us. **Young singles and newlyweds are the most likely to exercise, to go to bars, concerts, and movies, and to consume alcohol.** Young families are heavy users of disposable diapers and toys and games for children. They are also interested in household appliances, furniture, and such vehicles as minivans. Older couples and singles are more likely to use maintenance services, and older people are a prime market for retirement communities and golf products. **Condominiums that are built in Candian cities are often designed with different family structures in mind. Some are built in Candian cities are often designed with different family structures in mind. Some target single divorced men and women; other go after young families and include amenities such as on-site day care; and still others target vacation home buyers.** Canadian department stores also consider family life cycle by specifically targeting brides- and groom-to-be with weding registry services
* **INCOME AND SOCIAL CLASS** *The distribution of wealth is of great interest to marketers, because it determines which groups have the greatest buying power.* Many marketers are interested in capturing the hearts and wallets of high-income consumers. In Canada, the average family income is about **$58,000**, but 13.5 percent of the population has a household income above $100,000. These high-income consumers are a good target market for such luxury products as expensive juewellery, as well as financial services of brokers and investment products. The Wealthy Boomer Inc. is a Canadian company that targets high-income baby boom consumers with its magazine, The Wealthy Boomer. **At the same time, other marketers target average- and low-income consumers--the majority of Candian consumers.** The Hudson's Bay Company successfully target these income groups with its Bay and Zellers department stores.
* **ETHNICITY** As will be discussed further in Chapter 5, many Canadian marketers are adopting a multicultural approach to their marketing activities in recognition of the ethnic diversity of the Canadian population. Ethnicity can have a strong impact on a consumer's preferences for products and services, such as magazines or television shows, foods, apparel, and choice of leisure activities.
* SKIM for French and Aboriginal consumers. SKIM for Chinese. In summary, just use their language in advertising and advertise at the said language's channel
* **GEOGRAPHY** People's preferences for products and services often depend on which region of the country they live in. **For example, a recent study of how upper-income people across Canada spend their money showeded significant regional differences.** Compared to the average Candian, upper-income people living in Edmonton were more likely to spend their money on skiwear and snowmobile suits, those in Saskatoon were more likely to purchase home exercise equipment, those in Montreal were more likely to purchase leather and fur coats and jackets, those in Halifax were more likely to purchase art goods and decorative ware, those in St. John's were more likely to buy snow blowers, and those in the north were more likely to purchase outboard motor boats. Similarly, a study of snacking behaviour found that Maritimers consume more potato chips than consuemrs in other regions (almost double the national average), and Quebec consumers eat less than half of the average amount of corn chips that consumers in other regions do.
* **Recognition of these kinds of regional differences can lead marketers to focus efforts on one or more regions, or to have different marketing strategies in different regions. When marketers want to segment regional markets even more precisely, they sometimes combine geography with demographics by using a technique called geodemography. A basic assumption of geodemography is that "birds of a feather flock together". People who live near one another share similar characteristics. Sophisticated statistical techniques identify geographic areas that share the same preferences for household items, magazines, and other products. This allows marketers to construct segments consisting of households with a common pattern of preferences, so that a company can home in on those customers who are most likely to be interested in specific offerings--in some cases so precisely that families living on one block will be included in a segment whereas those on the next block will not.
* **One Canadian geodemographic system, PSYTE, is a large database developed by Compusearch Micromarketing Data and Systems. This system classifies Canadian consumers into 60 clusters, based on postal code and demographic information. The resulting clusters include Boomers and Teens, Conservative Homebodies, Young City Singles, Brie and Chablis, and Suburban Nesters.** The PSYTE system is used by Canada Post in its GeoPost Plus program, which allows marketers to target direct mail to clusters of consumers that match their target segment. For example, the Boomers and Teens segment is described as "late middle-aged consumers who are university and college educated with children over the age of six. Mostly double income families who live in their own homes". The cluster Young City Singles are "young singles and some couples who rent predominantly newer, downtown apartments and other dwellings". Using a geodemographic system like GeoPost Plus, a marketer of home improvement products like outdoor paint and fencing can identify precisely which postal codes will be the best prospects for direct mail advertising for their product, while avoiding other postal codes where resident aren't likely to be interested.

## SEGMENTING BUSINESS MARKETS
* We've reviewed the segmentation variables marketers use to divide up the consumer market, but how about all the business-to-business or industrial marketers? Segmentation also helps them to divide up business and organizational customers. Though the specfic variables may differ, the underlying logic of dividing the larger market into manageable pieces that share relevant characteristics is the same. **Although industrial markets tend to be smaller (in numbers of customers) and more concentrated, it is still important to segment these markets because no company has unlimited resources for developing and selling products and segmentation enables these companies to focus on thh best opportunities and develop products that uniquely meet the needs of the customers.**

#### Company-Specific Behaviour or Characteristics
* Just as it is fruitful to consider the behaviour of individual consumers when devising a segmentation scheme, it is fruitful to consider how busiensses and other organizations behave when devising segmentation schemes for industrial or business-to-business segmentation. Organizational buying behaviour will be the focus of Chapter 6. For now, it is important to recognize that organizations, through the people within them, act and behave in ways that are both similar to and different from consumers, and that the way they behave and operate is influenced by the types of products and services they both sell and needs. **Consequently, one way to segment organizations is by the unique way each operates.**
* **Organization buying and consumption behaivour is influenced by the production technology used; the type of purchases made; the busienss customer's degree of technical, financial, or operations expertise; how they make purchase decisions and who is involved in those decisions; whether the prospect is a current user or non-user of the product; and the frequency or size of the transactions.** These operating variables are all useful bases of segmentation. For example, Grand & Toy recognized the differences in the buying behaviour of large and small businesses when it launched the Stockroom, and Internet-based office supplies store that targets small businesses. While the Grand & Toy website is geared to the needs of large bujsinesses (offering benefits like large volume discounts), The Stockroom site caters to small business with its products and pricing policies. The general manager of The Stockroom describes the company's approach this way: "...we felt it was important to take a very aggressive, focus stance, purely aimed at the small business segment"
* **Busienss marketers also must consider how different customers will use their products or services. They must focus on identifying different end-use applications for these offerings. The personal computer industry is a good example of how firms can segment a market based on end use. Some major PC manufacturers, such as Dell, have divided the market into four segments: corporate, small business, government, and home or home office--each with its own computer-use profile. IBM segments its mainframe market into user "verticals"; different applications (such as health care or manufacturing) ofr which the mainframe computers might be used.**

### Industrial Psychographics
* Being concerned with psychology, thinking, feeling, and other mental states, the concept of psychographics relates only indirectly to organizations, but it does relate to the people who run and work in those organizations. Industrial psychographics, the application of psychographics to the business-to-business context, has mainly been applied to understanding buyers (purchasing agents or multiple people in a buying centre) to help salespeople better understand their one-on-one relationships with clients. It may also be fruitful to segment business markets by the mission, goals, and values of an organization and its management team, since purchase and consumption decisions and behaviours are likely to be consistent with those missions, goals, and values. This is the thinking of Steve Munden, director of research at the Toronto-based marketing firm Warrillow and Co. Munden is developing a psychographic profile of Generation Xers who own small- and medium-sized businesses. These entrepreneurs are people in their mid twenties to thirties who are increasingly leaving the workforce to take control of their lives and find financial independence. Munden thinks a psychographic profile of these entrepreneurs will help his client better target these business organizations--as the beliefs, values, and orientation of these entrepreneurs are expected to play a large role in their company's purchase decision
* **ORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS** **Demographic data help business marketers understand the needs and characteristics of their potential customers. For example, a manufacturer of work uniforms needs to know which industries currently provide uniforms for employees. For each industry that uses uniforms, from chemical processing to pest control, a marketer needs to know how many companies are potential customers, the number of employees in each company, what types of uniforms are needed, and so on.** That information enables the manufacturer to offer its services to the prospects that are most likely to be interested in outfitting employees in its protective clothing. 
* Many industries use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which will be further discussed in Chapter 6, to obtain information about the size and number of companies operating in a particular industry. Other government information sources, such as Statistics Canada and Strategis (www.strategis.gc.ca), provide valuable business demographic information.

## DEVELOPING PROFILES  
* Once marketers have divided a market into segments that meet the criteria of segmentation, the next task is to develop a brief **segment profile**, or description of each segment, with sufficient depth to be able to understand the segment so that it can be evaluated and either be targeted or rejected.
* One useful tempalte for developing these profiles is illustrated below, A rich profile would normally include a description of **1) who is the segment (using demographics, psychographics, and geographic variables); 2) what people or organizations in this segment want (benefits, features, and attributes) and why (needs, motivations); 3) when and where they expect to buy and use the product; 4) how they typically buy the product (such as purchase decision process, influences, sources of information, media preferences); or 5) how they typically use the product (consumption behaviour).** In addition, marketers try to estimate the size of each segment and its expected growth rate. An example of the application of this framework can be found in Chapter 14. For the purposes of selecting market segment to target, these profiles are usually created based on experience and judgment. **Sophisticated marketers, however, use market research and anlytic tools such as cluster analysis to verify profile assumption or to more scientifically identify the segments and their characteristics. This is discussed further in Appendix 4A.** The profiles of the segment(s) chosen for targeting (see below) are developed in much more detail and **provide, in part, the basis for making marketing mix decisions**.

        Who are they?
        * What are their demographic characteristics?
        * What are their psychographic characteristics?
        * What are geodemographic characteristics?
        * How price sensitive are they?

        What do they want and why?
        * What are the benefits, features, attributes, or characteristics sought by consumers in this segments?
        * What do they need and want?
        * What motivates the purchase and consumption decision?

        When do they buy and use it?
        * What triggers t he purchase decision?
        * What is the context in which they buy the product?
        * how often do they buy the product?
        * What time of day, part of the week, or month, or year is it purchased?
        * What time of day, part of the week, or month, or year is it used or consumed?

        Where do they buy and use it?
        * What stores or other distribution channels do they use?
        * Where are they when they use the product?

        How do they buy and use it?
        * How do they decide what to buy? (decision-making process used)
        * What or who influences the purchase decision?
        * Is it a thinking (cognitive) or feeling (emotional) decision?
        * Is it high involvement (important or risky) decision or a low involvement (not important or risky)?
        * How do they use or consume the product?
        * how much of it do they use?

        Segment Size
        * What is the market potential?
        * What is the expected growth rate of the segment?


### Market Targeting
* Once marketers have divided a market into actionable segments and developed a brief profile of each segment, they need to evaluate the attractiveness of each potential segment and decide which one or more of these groups they will target with marketing programs. The consumer or customer group(s) selected are the firm's **target market(s)**.
* SoyaWorld, a Canadian soy beverage marketer, has attained 60 percent of the dairy alternative market by carefully considering specific target markets. Soy beverages make up the fastest growing beverage category in Canada, and SoyaWorld has identified three main targets in the total market: the mainstream dairy market, the Asian market, and the organic market. For the mainstream dairy segment, SoyaWorld introduced So Good, a soy beverage with an improved taste that comes in several flavours. Since the product was being promoted as an alternative to milk, So Good was packaged to look like milk and was placed in the dairy cases of major supermarkets. Billboards, TV, and magazine ads, were all used to reach the mainstream market. SoyaWorld targets Asian consumers with its Sunrise brand, a product that has a more traditional soy beverage, and Rice Choice, a fortified rice beverage. To reach the organic and Asian segments, the SoyaWorld products are distributed through specialty retailers, such as Chinese grocery stores and health food stores, in addition to selected larger grocery stores. In this section, we'll review how marketers like SoyaWorld assess the customer groups in teh market, and what selection strategies they use for effective targeting.

### Target Market Selection
* There are three basic criteria for deciding which market segments are attractive to an organization: **segment size and growth, the external decision environment, and the internal decision environment.

1. Segment Size and Growth. When choosing market segments to target, one consideratoin is the size and growth of the segment. The segment must be "the right size"--large enough to be profitable now and in the future, but small enough that an organization can compete effectively in it. It is a lot easier to compete in a high growth segment than in a low or declining growth segment because in a high growth segment, new customers do not have to be taken away from existing competitors.
2. External Environment. While segment size and growth is aprt of the external environment, marketers tend to give that issue speical attention because of its strategic importance. There are, however, other external environment considerations when choosing market segment. **One is the level of competition.** Large and high growth segments are highly attractive to other competitors and a smaller organization may not have the resources to compete effectively against them. **It may make sense for smaller companies , with more limited resources, to focus on smaller segments (market niches) and not compete directly with larger competitors. This was the strategy of Sun Microsystems when it focused on the computer segment of engineering and scentific workstations in the early 1990s. As a small company it was able to dominate the overall computer market. Similarly, when Toyota introduced the Echo subcompact car into the Canadian market, the target segment was described demographically as "60/40 male/female, 40% married, median age 32, 48% university educated with an average household income $42,000." In addition, the segment displayed the following psychographic traits: idealistic, experimental, independent, educated, urban, and not brand loyal. This is like a fairly small segment, even on a national level, and it suggests that even large companies may decide to focus on small segments if they can create unique value there better than competitors can. I t may be more profitable to be a "big fish in a small pond", and being that "big fish" may discourage other competitors from entering the market segment.
* Related to the extent and level of competition is the industry structure. A local monopoly (or near monopoly) like Rogers Cable may choose to focus on large, less well-defined segments because there are no direct competitors (other than satelite TV services) focusing their strateiges on more narrow segments. Where there is extensive competition, dfifferent competitors will focus on increasingly narrow market segments, making it difficult for others to compete effectively in multiple segments.
* A segment with many substitute products may limit the price and hence profits in that segment. Segments where there are few buyers or buyers with otherwise strong bargaining position might ablso be unattractive as t hese buyers can keep prices down and play one supplier off another. Segments with strong suppliers (large, concentrated, or with few competitors or substitutes) may similarly be unattractive. Finally, as we will see in Chapter 8 (Product Management), segment attractiveness is also related to the stage of the product life cycle--where mature and declining markets are less attractive than new and growing ones.
3. Internal environment. The marketer must also be able to **adequately serve the needs of the segment and have the expertise and resources to do so better than the competition**. Some years ago, Exxon made the mistake of trying to enter the oofice product business, a growing segment. The company's expertise at selling petroleum products did not transfer to copying machines, and effort was unsuccessful. Four Season Hotels, on the other hand, was recently able to transfer its expertise in exceptional accommodation services aimed at a tightly defined, luxury lifestyle audience to an entirely new market sector, residential properties. The attractiveness of a segment depends on a company's ability to create value in that segment and defend their strategy in that segment. This requries an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the organization relative to the needs of the consumers and competition in that segment.

### TARGETING STRATEGY

##### Undifferentiated Marketing
* A company like Walmart that selects an **undifferentiated (or mass) targeting strategy** is appealing to a broad spectrum of people. If successul, this type of operation can be very efficient, especially because production, research, and promotion costs benefit from economies scale--it's cheaper to develop one product or one advertising campaign than to choose several targets and create separate products or messages for each. But the company must be willing to bet that people have similar needs, or that any difference among them will be so trivial that they will not matter, so that the same product and message will appeal to many customers. This is the approach Henry Ford used in offering the Model-T Ford--"in any color, so long as it was black". Today it is difficult to create a single product or offering that has very broad appeal. Consumers expect choices, there are many distribution channels from which to purchase products, and there are many focused-communication outlets that let marketers cost-effectively communicate to increasingly narrow target markets. **Companies with new-to-the-world innovations are the ones that most commonly practice undifferentiated marketing, but segments in these markets quickly develop as competitors enter these markets with differentiated products and consumers become more knowledgeable and demanding about the product category**j. When competitors are using a differentiated strategy it makes it difficult for the original innovator to continue using an undifferentiated strategy.

##### Differentiated Marketing
A company that chooses a differentiated targeting strategy develops one or more products for each of several distinct customer groups and make sure these offerings are kept separate in the marketplace. A differentiated strategy is called for when consumers are choosing among well-known brands, when each has a distinctive image in the marketplace, and when it's possible to identify one or more segments that have distinct needs for different types of product. Most large organizations follow a differentiation strategy. The cosmetics company L'Oreal uses a differentiated targeting strategy. The company has the resources to offer several product lines at a variety of prices. It targets the luxury market with such brands as Lancome and Helena Rubinstein, whereas less expensive offering such as Elseve and L'Oreal target large department stores and discounters. Even within product lines, Procter & Gamble has multiple laundry detergent products focused on different laundry detergent segments.

##### Concentrated Marketing
* When a firm focuses its efforts on offering one or more products to a single segment, it is using a concentrated targeting strategy. A concentrated strategy is often useful for smaller firms that do not have the resources or the desire to be all things to all people. For example, the cosmetic company Hard Candy, markets its funky line of nail polish and other products only to twentysommething women (or to those who wish they still were). Niche marketing is a type of concentrated targeting strategy where the market segment choice is relatively small. Jones Soda, for example, focuses on the alternative soft drink niche by offering a series of soft drink products for people who want a premium beverage that stands out, is individualized, expresses personality, and makes a fashion statement. **Niche marketing is becoming the norm in many markets as it allows many competitors to each make unique appeals and be the product of choice for some group of consumers**

##### Customized Marketing
**Ideally, marketers should be able to define segments so precisely that they can offer products and services that exactly meet the needs of every individual or firm.** **Custom marketing strategy, also called micro-marketing strategy, is when specific products and the messages about them are tailored to individual customers or locations. An individualized strategy is often used in business markets by commpanies, such as aircraft manfacturer Bombardier, to make sure the individual needs of its few customers who spend a lot of money are met. **In consumer markets, this level of concentration shows up in personal or professional services, by doctors, lawyers, and hair stylists, for example. In most consumer markets, individualized marketing strategies are neither practical nor possible when products are mass-produced. However, advances in technology, coupled with the new emphasis on building solid relationship with customers, have enabled mass customization. Clothing manfacturers like Levi Strauss and the high-end German clothier Engelhorn, for example, use digital imaging technology to do body scans of customers that enable the creation of perfectly fitting jeans, swimwear, or other clothing products. Calgary-based Critical Mass has worked with Nike to develop NIKEiD, an interactive part of the Nike website where consumers can design and purchase their own running shoes. Dell uses the Internet to provide custom-built computer; customers choose among various options and Dell makes the computer to order. Individualized communication has also been enabled by Internet and email technologies. Online retailers, such as HMV.com, for example, are able to send customized messages to user regarding the status of their orders, upcoming promotions that may be of interest based on the product they have bought in the past, and announcements, of new releases. 

## POSITIONING
* The final, **crucial stage of the target marketing process is providing consumers in a targeted market segment with a product or service that meets their unique needs and expectations. Positioning means developing a marketing strategy that clearly differentiates a firm from its competitors along key dimensions of value that are important to target consuemrs or customers**. When describing a positioning strategy, **marketers often focus on four elements: differentiation, strategic orientation, defendability, and brand personality.**
* Differentiation relates to how your offer will be different from, or better than, competitive offerings, at least in the minds of your target customers. **A brand concept is how a firm wants to be differentiated.** WestJet, for example, wants to be known as the airline brand that provides the best value--low prices and good service from friendly, personable staff that provides the best value. BC Ethic, the apparel manufacturer known for repopularizing the retro, button-down boling shirt style worn by Seinfeld's Kramer, positions its shirts as being "cool" and supports that differentiation by offering customized embroidered shirts free to music artists like the Barenaked Ladies and Cypress Hill. Most successful organizations are able to differentiate themselves on more than one dimension of value to customers. **Starbucks, for example, competes on quality (an affordable luxury), selection and customization (you can have it your way), convenience (many locations), and atmosphere(replacing bars as a place to socialize with friends)**. While much of marketing communication strategy involves establishing a brand's differentiation in the minds of its customers, sometimes the intended result is not achieved. **Brand image is the perceived positioning of a product by consumers.** Canadian consumers, for example, perceived positioning Knorr soups, sauces, and marinades as being "refined, polished, and sophisticated"--but Unilever wanted its Knorr brand to be more acessible and work as an everyday solution. The company developed its "A Little Bit More" Campaign to reinforce the idea that Knorr products have more interesting ingredients than competitors' brands and offer numerous opportunities for everyday culinary creativity. The phrase "a littl bit more" in Knorr's communication strategy is its slogan or tag line--which usually communicates the unique selling proposition or key point of differentiation underlying a brand's positioning.


### STRATEGIC ORIENTATION
* **Strategic orientation is the marketing strategy behind the desired differentation. It is the overall approach to how you plan to compete and create value for your customers. There are numerous frameworks or typologies that summarize key marketing and positioning strategies, and they all have different perspective on how prodcuts can be differentiated. One of these suggests that firms can focus on one or more of the following strategies: product leadership, customer intimacy, or operational excellence.** Product leadership is a strategy of competing by continually bringing innovative and useful new products or technologies to market. Adopted by companies such as 3M, Apple, and Nike, **it is concerned with product innovation, quality, performance, superiority, and other forms of functional value.** Positioning consistent with a product leadership strategy focuses on dimension such as the following:

        * Quality (e.g., FordL "Quality is Job 1"; Gillette: "The best a man can get")
        * Reliability or durability (e.g., Timex: "It takes a lick'n and keeps on tick'n")
        * Key features or attributes (e.g., Honda Civic: "Better gas mileage. A Civic responsibility")
        * Innovation (e.g., Lexus: "The relentless pursuit of excellence"; GE: "Progress is our most important product")
        * Performance (e.g., BMW: "The ultimate driving machine"; Apple: "The power to do your best")
        * Outcomes (e.g., Buckley's: "It tastes awful. And it works)

* Customer intimacy, or micro-marketing, is a strategy concerned with creating tailored solution for narrowly defined market segments. Companies such as Kraft, Nordstrom, Marriott, and Levi Strauss aim to excel at providing superior customer experiences and/or  personalized or customized interactions through outstanding service quality, customer support, flexibility, and customerization. Concerned with the creation of experiential or emotional value, customer intimacy positioning strategies focus on dimension such as the following:

        * Sensory experience (e.g., KFC: "Finger lick'n good"; A&W: "That frosty mug sensation")
        * Excitement, adventure (e.g., Nike: "Just do it"; Pontiac: "We drive excitement"; Club Med: "Do it now, do it fast, and do everything at the same time")
        * Fun or pleasure (e.g., Mcdonald's: "I'm lovin' it"; Lay's: "Betcha can't eat just one")
        * Emotion (e.g., harlequin: "Live the emotion"; Hallmark: "When you care enough to send the very best")
        * Social value (e.g., Dr Beers: "Diamonds are forever"; AT&T: "reach out and touch someone")
        * Responsiveness, customized, personalized (e.g., Burger King: "have it your)
        * Safety or security (e.g., Allstate: "You're in good hands with Allstate"; Michelin: "Because so much is riding on your tires")
        * Novelty, knowledge, or fantasy (e.g., Disney Online: "Where the magic comes to you"; Microsoft: "where do you want to go today?")

Operational excellence is a strategy focused on cost effectiveness, efficiency, and customer convenience. Companies such as Zellers, WestJet Airlines, Dell and Ikea are tenacious at lowering costs and customer prices while making it more convenient to do business with them. Concerned with the creation of cost-sacrifice value, operational excellence positioning strategies focus on dimension such as the following:

        * Price (e.g., Zeller: "The lowest price is the law"; Buy.com: "Canada's low price Internet superstore)
        * Value (e.g., Ikea: "Swedish for common sense)
        * Convenience (e.g., 7-Eleven: "Oh thank heaven"; American Express: "Don't leave home without it")
        * Personal investment of time, effort, or energy (e.g., yellow Page: "Let your fingers do the walking")
        * Risk (e.g., Levi's Jean: "Have you ever had a bad time in levi's?"; Listerine mouthwash: "Even your best friend won't tell you")

* Another common positioning strategy is concerned with **symbolic-expressive value--differentiating your brand by the psychological meaning associated with it.** **Some products (luxury goods for example) appeal to consumers' self-concept and self-worth--that is, they make us feel good about ourselves.** Other products (such as music or comfort foods, among many others) have personal meaning--association with people or events that only have meaning to a particular consumer (such as an association with Tide because Mom used it). Products can also provide Volkswagen Beetle, or Body Shop lotions allow consumers to reflect or express their personalities, tastes, and values. **Still other products focus on social meaning--how others see us.** Products such as BMW cars, Birks jewellery, and Lee Valley Tools are purchased because of their prestige, status, or image. Brands can also be positioned on one or more of these four symbolic meaning dimension. For example:

        * Self identity/concept/worth (e.g., L'Oreal: "Because I'm worth it")
        * Personal meaning (e.g., Kodak: "Share moments. Share life")
        * Self-expression (e.g., Canon: "Express yourself")
        * Social meaning (e.g., Grey Poupon: "Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?"; Rolls-Royce: "Trusted to deliver excellence")

* There are many other marketing strategy framework or typologigies that you will learn about in a marketing strategy course. However, there are some other ways to differentiate products and establish a brand's position in the marketplace. These include strategies that emphasize:

        * Product class leadership: The Mazda Miata is a sporty convertible
        * Relative positioning: The Pepsi Challenge claims "more people prefer the taste of Pepsi over Coke". (This is an example of head-to-head competitive positioning, **where other organizations try to associate their brand with the market leader**)
        * Use occasions: Wrigley's gum is an alternative at times when smoking is not permitted
        * user: Sunny Delight is the "Goodness kids go for"

### Defendability
* The choice of strategic orientation and the basis of differentiation is dependent on an organization's ability to defend the positioning. Analysis of your ability to defnd a particular positioning requires an assessment of the strengths and weakensses of your own organization and your ability to create sustainable competitive advantage, and the opportunities and threats in the external environment, in particular consumer behaviour and your assessment of the strategies and capabilities of your competitors (recall SWOT analysis).

## ANALYZE COMPETITORS' POSITIONS

## VALUE CREATION AND SUSTAINABLE COMPETITVE ADVANTAGE
* The second aspect of an assessment of defendability is to assess your ability to create the value proposition and basis of differentiation that you intend in your brand concept, and you ability to sustain your strategic orientation in the face of comeptitive reaction. Different strategic orientations require different organizational strengths (capabilities), focus, and resource allocation, and they are often associated with different organizational cultures

* **This makes it difficult to be the industry leader in more than one of these areas. At issue is whether an organization has the skills, abilities, resources, organizational structure, and culture to create the intended offer such that it will be perceived as superior by members of the target market on the differentiation dimensions reflected in the positioning strategy; whether the organization can communicate this effectively to the target market; and whether it can continue to do this until its goals are met as an organization.** Marketers need to explain how they are going to be able to sustain the basis for value creating differentiation in the minds of its target customer.
* There are three main ways to defend a positioning strategy. **The first is to continuously innovate to keep ahead of competitors. This is the approach typically followed by organizations adopting a product leadership strategy.** The second approach is to hide in a small enough niche market that competitors are not likely to enter--either because the market is not big enough to warrant attention, or because they are significant first-mover advantages in that market, such that followers into the market are at serious disadvantage. The third is to protect current source(s) of competitive advantage by erecting barriers to competition. Some of t hese barriers include:

        * Marketing expertise: companies that are market oriented and customer driven can protect a customer intimacy positioning by being closer to and more understanding of customer needs, wants, and behaviours; by being more flexible; and by being more responsive to customer
        * Customer loyalty: competitors find it difficult to get loyal customers to switch bransd. Companies who have developed loyal customers can protect their positioning by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. Some strategy experts argue that relationships are the only true source of sustainable competitive advantage as other barriers can eventually be eroded.
        * Monopolization of a scarce resrouce: Retailers restrict competition by gaining exclusive access to retail locations. Other organizations secure exclusive supply or distribution contracts to limit the ability of competitors to enter markets.
        * Proprietary technology: patent, copyrights, and other mechanisms that protect intellectual property can help protect current sources of competitive advantage
        * Culture-based expertise: companies that develop core competencies or specialized knowledge in application, manufacturing, new product development, or other value creating activities within organizations can protect a positioning strategy based on that expertise if it permeates an organization's culture in a way that is difficult to emulate. Cultures take a long time to develop and it is very difficult for competitors to emulate culture-based expertise.
        * Legislation or regulatory approval: cellphone companies and cable companies are partially protected from competition by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunciations Commision and the need for regulatory approval to set up cell networks or cable networks
        * Capital requirements: high market-entry costs, such as the cost of specialized equipment, technology, or setting up a sales force or distribution channel, can be a barrier to competitors, particularly in small market niches that may support only one or two competitors

## BRINGING A PRODUCT TO LIFE: THE BRAND PERSONALITY
* The final element of a positioning strategy is creating a brand personality. Brands, like people, can be described in terms of personality traits. These descriptions might include words like cheap, elegant, sexy, bold, or wimpy. A positioning strate SKIM

## IMPLEMENTING THE POSITIONING STRATEGY
* **The success of a target marketing strategy hinges on a marketer's ability to identify and select an appropriate market segment or market segments** Then the marketer must devise a positioning that will set apart their offer from their competitors', that will be highly appealing to the target market, and that can be defended. The marketing mix decisions relating to product, pricing, distribution, and communication are then made in a way that supports the desired positioning. In effect, the marketing mix is the way that positioning get implemented. **Because everything else depends on segmentation and positioning decision, segmentation and positioning, together, are the two most important concepts in marketing.**
* Montreal-based G.I Energy Drinks developed the following strategy when it introduced the Guru energy drink. The company segmented the market in terms of age and psycholographics, and then target a segment of 16- to 24-year-olds, whose profiles indicated they were into "new-age" beverages that would give them a feeling of energy without unhealthy additives. The company reached these consumers by selling its drinks at raves in Montreal and Toronto, advertising in club culture magazines, and sponsoring events like snowboarding demonstrations. A company spokeperson describe the Guru positioning strategy this way: "We really feel the best way to reach people is trhough trial and onsite promotions... We want to provide the consumer with a drink that will enhance the activity they are already participating in"
* We previously discussed **some of the challenges in segmentation. The four main positioning challenge are: 1) vague positioning, where company do not clearly articulate their main point(s) of differentiation; 2) confused positioning, where the positioning strategy keeps changing (like McDonald's), making it difficult for consumers or customers to understand what the brand is supposed to mean to them; 3) off-target positioning, where companies do not differentiate themselves on dimension important to consumers or customers; and 4) over positioning, where companies position themsleves too narrowly, either appealing to too small a market segment or being unable to change or adapt their positioning with changing market condition.**
* *Evaluate the target market's responses and modify the strategy*. The target marketing process is ongoing. Over time an organization like Molson may find that it needs to change the segments it targets, and the needs or wants of people in these chosen segments may change as well. Marketers need to monitor these changes and adjust their positioning strategies when necessary. Sometimes marketers redo a product's position to respond to marketplace changes.

Marketing Concepts: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. Some critics of marketing have suggested that marketing segmentation and target marketing lead to an unnecessary proliferation of product choices, which wates valuable resources. These critics suggest that if marketers didn't create so many different product choices, there would be more resources to feed the hunry, house the homeless, and provide for the needs of people around the globe.

## THE STEPS IN THE MARKETING RESEARCH PROCESS
* The collection and interpretation of strategic information is hardly a one-shot deal that managers engage in "just out of curiosity". Ideally, marketing research is an ongoing process, a series of steps marketers take to learn about the marketplace. Whether a company conducts the research itself or hire another firm to do it, the goal is the sam--**to help managers make informed marketing decision**

        ->

        * Prepare the Research Report: Executive summary; description of methodology; discussion of results; limitation; conclusion and recommendation 

#### Define the problem
* Defining the research problem as precisely as possible allows marketers to search for the right answers to the right questions. Sometimes marketers can not determine exactly what the problem is because they're focusing on symptoms, such as declining sales, and not on the underlying problem that's causing sales to drop. For example, a drop in sales of a sunscreen may be due to a new competitor, lack of cooperation from distributors, or even a fashion trend promoting a deep tan.

Defining the problem has four components:
1. Specify the management decision: the most important stage of the research process is figuring out what marketing (or other) decisions need to be made with the information being sought. For example, **is the key decision "What market segment should I target?" or is the key decision "How could I price this product?"** The research needed for making the first decision won't be useful for making the second decision or vice versa--**and generally, you can only focus on one key decision in any given piece of research because different decisions require different research questions, samples, and methods. Specifying the relative importance of the decision is also useful as it helps guide the scope of the research activity and how much time, effort, and resources should be allocated to the project.**
2. Specify the research objectives or research questions. What questions will be research attempt to answer? Once the key decision is identified, **you need to ask yourself "what general questions do I need to answer to make that decision?" For example, if the key decision is "What market segment should I target?" some key questions (among others) that need to be answered are: What are the key alternative market segments? What are the profile and size of these segments? What brands are currently targeted at each segment? How is our brand positioned (or how might it be positioned) relative to competitors? What are sources of competitive advantage that will allow us to defnd our desired positioning?**
* Often the importance of a research question surface during exploratory resarch. For example, Mercedes-Benz regularly monitors drivers' perceptions of its cars, partly through feedback from dealers. When the company started getting reports from its dealers that people were viewing the cars as being deserved only after they become "successful", it developed the "ice crean" television ad. It attempts to dispel the attitude that consuemrs should wait until their big promotion to indulge themselves. Often marketers want to know how much of a product they are likely to sell. There are many approaches to developing a sales forecast. Some of the common approaches are described in Appendix 4B.
3. Identify the information needs. Once research specify the resarch questions or objectives, **they need to specify what needs to be learned or known, and from whom--indicating the population or group of interest.** For example, to answer the research question "What are the profile of each segment?" we would want to know specific information like: What are the benfit sought by each identified segment? What are the demographic dcharacteristics of each segment? (e.g., sex, age, income), what are the psychographic characteristics of each segment (e.g., lifestyle, interests, values), what are the media use behaviours for each segment (e.g., magazine and newspapers read, radio stations listened to, TV programs watched)
* **These information needs are not the questions you would see in a questionaire or interview guide, but they inform those questions and give a researcher rationale for including or not including specific questions on a questionaire. If the question does not address an information need, it is not required on the questionaire.** Information needs also inform methodology, or the research technique, as different types of information can be gathered from different sources or by using different techniques.
4. Place the problem in an environmental context. The problem definition should also specify the factors in teh firm's internal and external business environment that might be causing or influencing the situation. Placing the problem in the context of the firm's environment helps researchers structure the research, determine the specific types of questions to ask, and identify factors they will need to take into account when interpreting results. Environmental conditions also provide a valuable perspective. For example, when the economy is tight and sales of luxury cars are generally declining, the propulation to be studied might be narrowed down to a select group of consumers who are still willing and able to indulge in a luxury vehicle. Alternatively, consuemrs may be moving away from glitzt status-conscious materialism, so that the research question comes down to how promotional strategies can convey honest and basic values that go beyond "snob appeal".

#### Determine the Research Design
* Once marketers have isolated specific problems, the second step of the research processis to decide on a "plan of attack". **This plan is the researrch design, which specifies what information marketers will collect and what type of study they will do.** All marketing problems do not call for the same techniques, even though marketers can solve some problems effectively with a number of alternative techniques, and diversity in approaches can often provide greater insight and greater confidence in the results.

        Secondary Research -> Internal Sources -> Company reports; previous company research; salesperson feedback;customer feedback
                        -> External Resources: Publish research; trade organizations; syndicated research; government sources
        
        Primary Research -> Exploratry Research -> Interviews; focus groups; projective techniques; case studies; ethnographies

                        -> Descriptive research -> Cross-sectional; longitudinal
                        -> Causal Research -> Laboratory research; field studies

* **Secondary versus primary research**: The very first question to ask in determining the research design is whether or not the information required for making a decision already exists--either inside the organization or from external secondary sources. For example, a coffee producer who needs to know the differences in coffee consumption among different demographic and geographic segments of the market may find that the information needed is available from a study conducted by the Canadian Coffee Association for its members or even from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Data that are collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand are called secondary data. The use of secondary data can save time and money because the expense of designing and implementing a study has already been paid. however, secondary data, having been created for another purpsoe, may not be current enough or relevant enough for a particular marketing decision. Another key limitation of secondary data is the methodology used to collect it is often not reported and users do not know whether there were any flaws or limitations in the research design
* Sometimes secondary research is not enough. When a company needs to make a specific decision, it often needs to conduct research to collect primary data--that is, information collected directly from respondents to specifically address the question at hand. The advantage of primary data is that designed specifically to meet the needs of the organization. however, collecting primary data can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process.
* **Exploratory (Qualitative) research**: Marketers use exploratory research to generate topics for future, more rigorous studies, ideas for new strategies and opportunities; or just to get better handle on a problem they are experiencing with a product. Because **the studies are usually small in scale and less costly to conduct than other techniques**, **marketers can use exploratory research to test their hunches about what's going on without too much risk. Exploratory research often involve in-depth probing of a few consumers who fit the profile of the "typical" customer. Researchers may interview consumers, salespeople, watch what people do when choosing among competing brands in a store aisle. Or they may locate places where the consuemrs of interest hang out and ask questions in these settings.** Some researchers find that many young people are too suspicious or skeptical in traditional research settings, so they may interview young people waiting in lines to buy concert tickets or in clubs. Pantene and Sony, for example, have reached over **500,000 Canadian teens** by sponsoring high school video dance parties and then providing incentive for the teens to visit the company webistes to provide product feedback and answer buying behaviour questions. Corby Distilleries discovered that **its focus groups were more effective when carried out in its consumers' natural environment--their local bar on a Friday night.**
* Most exploratory research **provides qualitative data, detailed verbal or visual information (for example, videotapes of people preparing dinner at home) about consumers' attitudes, feelings, and buying behaviours that is summarized in words rather than numbers.** Researchers for a manufacturer of Swiss chocolate, for example, interviewed consumers and found that many chocolate lovers hide secret stashes around their home. The company used the results of this exploratory research to develop an advertising campaign built around the theme: "The True Confessions of Chocaholic".
* Exploratory research can take many forms. **Consumer interviews are one-on-one discussions in which an individual shares his or her thoughts in person with a researcher.** In addition to interviewing actual users of their product, some marketers find it useful to interview people who may not themselves be consumers, but who may know a lot about the consumers. **One Canadian ad agency working on an ad campaign for scotch interviewed bartenders to gain additional insight into scotch drinkers.** Another agency in England, working on an ad for a shoe company, talked to people who shined shoes...SKIM
* The **focus group** is the technique marketing researchers most often use for collecting exploratory data. Focus groups usually **consist of eight to twelve recruited consumers**, who sit together to discuss a product, ad, or some other marketing topic introduced by a discussion leader or moderator. Ontario energy and enery service provider Direct Energy, for example, used focus group in a repositioning process that resulted in the company wanting to be known for its people and ideas rather than just for its products, technology, or dependability. Typically, the moderator tapes these group discussions, which may be held at speical interivewing facilities that allow for observation ("spying") by the client, who watches from behind a one-way mirror. Focus group don't always run smoothly, particularly if one or two opinionated members dominate the session or if "professional" focus group participants get by screening criteria intended to ensure that the participants fit the intended participant profile. Researchers screen focus group participants in advance to meet criteria that will make their opinions relevant. For example, participants may be recruited, not because they use the company's brand, but because they use a competitor's product.
* As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, web-based research companies like SurveySite are able to conduct focus groups with people around the country or around the world by setting up interactive sessions online. Many researchers use **projective techniques** to **get at people's underlying feelings, especially when they feel that people will be unable or unwilling to express their true reactions. A projective test asks the participant to respond to some ambiguous object, often by telling a story about it.
* The **case study** is a comprehensive examination of a particular firm or organization. In business-to-business marketing research in which the customers are other firms, for example, researchers may try to learn how one company makes its purchases. Their goal is to identify the key deicsion makers, to learn what criteria they emphasize when choosing between suppliers, and perhaps to learn something about any conflicts and rivalries among these decision makers that may influence their choices.
* Ethnography SKIM

* **DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH**: We've seen that marketers have many tools at their disposal, including focus groups and ethnographic techniques, to help them better define a problem or opportunity. These are usually modest studies involving a small number of people. In some situations, this information is all that the marketer needs to make decisions; but very often, the next step after exploratory research is to conduct descriptive research, **which probes more systematically into the problem and bases its conclusion on larger numbers of observations.** These observations typically are quantitative data that take the form of averages, percentages, or other statistics summarizing results from a large set of measurements. Quantitative data can be as simple as the number of large-screen TVs sold in a month in Future Shop locations in different regions of the country, or as complex as statistical analyses of responses to a survey mailed to thousands of consumers. In each case, **analyses are conducted to answer a specific question in contrast to the "fishing expedition" that may occur in exploratory research.**
* The most common descriptive technique is **cross-sectional design**. This involves the systematic collection of quantitative information, such as responses to a survey or data from store register receipts, from one or more samples of respondents at one point in time. The data may be collected on more than one occasion but generally not from the same pool of respondents. Lever Pond's did a cross-sectional survey of dermatologists to determine which soap they recommend to their paitents for mildness. **Since 87 percent of the respondents recommended the Lever Pond's brand Dove, and only 13 percent recommended the competitive brand, the company turned the results of its survey directly into an advertising campaign. Outdoor billboards that showed the results of the survey were used in major centres across Canada**.
* longitudinal design SKIM

* **CAUSAL RESEARCH**: It is a fact that purchases of both diapers and beer peak between 5pm and 7pm. Can we say that purchasing one of t hese products caused shoppers to purchase the other as well--and, if so, which caused which? Or is the answer simply that this happens to be the time that young faters stop at the store on their way home from work for brew and Pampers?
* The descriptive techniques we've examined do a good job of providing valuable information about what is happening in the marketplace, but they can't tell us why. Sometimes marketers need to know if something they've done has brought about some change in behaviour. For example, does the layout and design of a store affect the amount people buy? This questions can't be answered through simple observation.
* For example, managers at a grocery chain notice from their sales data across a number of stores that purchases of produce are higher in those stores that are designed to resemble farmers' market, with free-flowing layouts and "stalls" where produce is displayed. Can we say that design of these stores caused the increased sales, or is the answer simply that these stores happen to be located in areas where people buy more produce no matter what the store look like?
* Causal research refers to techniques that attempt to understand cause-and-effect relationships. In causal research, marketers want to know if a change in something (for example, layout used in a store) is responsible for a change in something else (for example, an increase in produce sales). They call the factors that might cause such a change independent variables and outcomes dependent variables. In this example, the layout of the store is an independent vairable and sales data for producre are a dependent variable.
* To rule out alternative exaplanations, researchers must carefully design experiments that test specified relationships among variables in a controlled environment. Because this approach tries to eliminate competing explanations for the outcome, respondents may be brought to a laboratory where the researcher can be sure that they are reacting to precisely what they should be and nothing else. For example, a study testing whether the layout in a grocery store influences the likelihood that shoppers will buy more produce might bring a group of people into a testing facility, where they are shown a "virtual store" on a computer screen and asked to fill a grocery cart as they click through the "aisle". The experiment might vary the interior of the store as a market style layout or a more typical grid layout to see if this affects whether people put more produce into their carts. SKIM

### Choose t he Method for Collecting Data
* When the researcher decides to conduct descriptive research, the next step in the marketing research process is to figure out just how to collect it. **The two main primary data collection methods can be broadly described as interactive and passive**.
* **INTERACTIVE METHODS** Interactive methods involve some kind of interview or other direct contact with respondents who answer questions. These responses are then combined with those of other respondents to arrive at some general conclusions. **The most common interactive instrument is a survey, a questionaire asking participants about their beliefs or behaviours**. For example, when Virgin Mobile wanted to find a theme for its new promotional campaign, it conducted a survey of Canadian cellphone users to find out what it would take for consumers to switch from their current cellphone provider. The survey found that 40 percent of Canadian respondents indicated that if they could retain the cellphone numbers, they would switch. Virgin used this insight to develop a new campaign centred around the "you can switch" concept. Surveys can be administered on the phone, in person, through the mail, by fax, or over the Internet.
* Surveys or questionaires differ in their degree of structure. With a totally unstructured questionaire, the researcher loosely determines the questions in advance. Questions may evolve from what the respondent says to previous questions. At the other extreme the researcher uses a completely structured questionaire. She asks every respondent the exact same questions and each participant responds to the same set of fixed choices. You have probably experienced this kind of questionaire, where you might have had to respond to a statement by saying if you "strongly agree", "somewhat agree", and so on. Moderately structured questionaires ask each respondent the same questions, but the respondent is allowed to answer the questions in his own words.
* Surveys can be administered in a variety of ways, each of which has its pros and cons.
1. **Mail Surveys**: Mail surveys are easy to administer and offer a **high degree of anonymity to respondents**. On the downside, because the questionnaire is printed and mailed, researchers have **little flexibility in the types of questions they can ask** and **little control over the circumstances under which the respondent is answering them**. Mail surveys also take a long time to get back to the company and are likely to **have a much lower response rate** than other types of surveys because people tend to ignore them
2. **Telephone Survey**: Telephone surveys usually consist of a brief phone conversation in which an interviewer reads a short list of questions to the respondent. One problem with this approach is that the growth of telemarketing, the sale of products and services over the phone, has eroded the willingness of many consumers to participate in phone surveys--especially when those telemarketers have pretended to be conducting marketing research. Another drawback of telephone survey is that the respondent may not feel comfortable speaking directly to an interviewer, especially if the survey is about a sensitive subject. Finally, increasing numbers of people use answering machines and caller identification to screen calls, further reducing the response rate.
3. **Face-to-face Surveys**: Face-to-face surveys, in which a live interviewer asks questions of a respondent by, for example, going door to door, used to be a common way to collect data. However, this practice has declined markedly in recent years due to escalating costs and security concerns--people just aren't willing to open their doors to strangers anymore. More typically, today's face-to-face interviews occur in a "mall-intercept" study in which researchers recruit shoppers in malls or other public areas. Mall-intercepts offer good opportunities to get feedback about marketing issues like new package designs or styles or even reactions to new foods or fragances. **However, because only certain goups of the population frequently shop at malls, a mall-intercept study does not provide the researcher with a representative sample of the population unless the population of interest is mall shoppers.** In addition to the mall-intercept being more expensive than mail or phone surveys, respondents may be relutant to answer questions of a personal nature in a face-to-face context. Rather than relying on face-to-face surveys, Staple Business Depot Canada decided to use **automated kiosks in its stores to survey consumers about their satisfaction with the company.** Because of the anonymity that the kiosk affords respondents, the company estimates that two out of three people take part in the kiosk surveys, compared with one out of three who are asked to do a face-to-face survey.
* **Online Surveys**: Online surveys are growing in popularity. The Carrier Corporations, which makes air conditioners, found respondents more willing to answer questions about its products via computer, perhaps because it's more interesting to take a survey this way. Companies are making it even easier for consumers to respond to surveys by administering surveys on handheld devices like Palms and Pockets PCs. Online surveys are a quick and cost-effective way to collect data. Unlike mail and phone surveys, online surveys can generate a large number of responses very quickly. However, it must be remembered that, like the people who visit malls, people who use the Internet are not respresentative of the total population. Online surveys are, therefore, useful only for those companies whose population of interest is people who are online. An additional concern about online surveys relates to the quality of responses the firm will receive--particularly because no one can be really sure who is typing in the responses. Online research is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
* **PASSIVE METHODS**: Other forms of data collection use a passive instrument in which the consumer's behaviour are simmply recorded--often without his or her knowledge. Reseachers do this through personal observation, unobtrustive measures, and mechanical observation.
* **Personal Observation**: with personal obversation, consumers in public settings are watched to understand how they react to marketing activities. After Frito-Lay spent some time in grocery stores, it found that shoppers spend a lot less time in grocery stores, it found that shoppers spend a lot less time in the grocery store, and spend little time in the aisles. This meant that it had to get its product displays on the perimeter of the store whenever possible. Researchers for Rocky Mountaineer rail tours observed its customers' behaviour as they were travelling through the Canadian Rockies by train. They noticed that these travellers seemed to like the experience of the train trip itself as much as the beautiful scenery they were seeing. **This led the company to change the theme of its advertising from just talking about the mountain scenery to talking about the train service experience. One of the ads claimed: "No one ever wrote a fold song about a minivan", and the overall slogan for the new ads was "The only way to see the Canadian Rokies". The company saw a 23 percent increase in its bookings as a result of the ads.**
* Some companies have successfully used observation in combination with other methods, such as consumer interviews, in an effort to improve the quality of information gathered. **To examine how consumers make milk brand decisions, researchers in Atlantic Canada observed over 200 consumers in 12 stores and followed up with a brief interviews. In the interviews, consumers claimed that they bought a certain brand, even though the researcher knew fromm observation that they had bought a different one. Similarly, in interviews most consumers claimed that they checked the expiry date on the milk cartons, whereas observation showed that hardly anyone did so. All of this information allowed the researchers to conclude that milk is a low-involvement purchasing decision with weak loyalty levels. The consumers were not deliberately lying in the interviews, they simply did not pay that much attention to their milk buying behaviour. As this example, shows, sometimes it is wise to use multiple research methods when performing marketing reseach.**
* **Unobstrusive Measure**: Researchers also use unobstrusive measures to check traces of physical evidence that remain after some action has been taken, when they suspect that people will probably alter their behaviour if they know they are being observed 
* **Mechanical Observation**: Mechanical observation relies on non-human devices to record behaviour. For example, some grocery stores use GPS units on their grocery carts to track shoppers' movement through their stores to determine shopping patterns and hot spots.

#### Data Quality: Garbage In, Garbage out
* A firm can gather data in many ways, including focus groups, ethnographies, observational studies, and controlled experiments. But how much faith should it place in what it finds? 
* A research project is only a good as the information it collects. All too often, marketers who have commissioned a study assume that because they have a massive report full of impressive-looking numbers and tables, they must have the "truth". Unfortunately, there are times when this "truth" is really jsut one person's interpretation of the facts. At other times, the data used to generate recommendations areflawed. Typically, three factors influence the quality of research results--validity, reliability, and representativeness
* **VALIDITY**: Validity is the extend to which the research actually measures what it was intended to measure. This was partof the problem underlying the famous New Coke fiasco in the 1980, in which Coca-Cola underestimated people's loyalty to its flagship soft drink after it relaced "Old Coke" with a new, sweeter formula. The company assumed that blind taste testers' preferences for one anonymous cola over another were a valid measure of consumers' preferences for a cola brand. Coke found out the hard way that only measuring taste is not the same as measuring people's deep allegiances to their favourite soft drink, and sales eventually recovered after the company brought back the old version as "Coca-Cola Classic".
* **RELIABILITY** Reliability is the extent to which the research measurement techniques are free of errors. Sometimes, for example, the way a researcher asks a question creates an error by biasing people's responses. Imagine that an interviewer working for Trojans condoms stopped male college students on campus and asked them if they used contraceptive products. Do you think their answers might change if they were asked the same questionson an anonymous survey they received in the mail? Most likely they would be different, **because people are relutant to disclose what they actually do when their responses are not anonymous. Reseachers try to maximize reliability by thinking of several different ways to ask the same questions, by asking these questions on several occasions, or by using several analysts to interpret the responses.**
* Reliability is a problem when the researchers can't be sure the consuemr population they're studying even understands what is being asked. For example, children are difficult subjects for market researchers, because they tend to be undependable reporters of their own behaviour, have poor recall, and often do not understand abstract questions. in many cases, the children can not explain why they prefer one item over another (or they are not willing to share these secrets with grown-ups). For these reasons, researchers have had to be especially creative in designing studies involving younger consumers. In the example shown (called a commpletion test), boys are told to write in the empty balloon what they think the boy in the darwing will answer when the girl ask, "What program do you want to watch next?" Reliability is increased because the children can respond to pictures depicting a familiar situation in their own words.
* **REPRESENTATIVENESS** Representativeness is the extend to which consumers in the study are similar to a larger group in which the organization has an interest. This criterion for evaluating research underscores the importance of **sampling**, the process of selecting respondents for a study. The issue then becomes how large or small  the sample should be and how these people are chosen. 

#### Design the Sample
* **Once the researcher has defined the problem, decided on a research design, and determined how to collect the data, the next step is to decide from whom to obtain the needed data.** Of course, the researcher could collect the information from every single customer or prospective customer, but this would be extremely expensive and time consuming, if possible at all. Instead, researchers collect most of their data from a small proportion or sample of the population of interest. Based on the answers of this sample, researchers hope to generalize to the larger population. Whether such inferences are accurate or inaccurate depends on the type and quality of the study sample. There are two main types of samples: probability and non probability samples.
* **PROBABILITY SAMPLING**: **With a probability sample, each member of the population has some known chance of being included in the sample**. Using a probability sample ensures researchers that the sample is representative of the population and that inferences about the population made from the sample are justified. For example, if a larger percentage of males than females in a probability sample say they prefer action movies to "chick flicks", one can infer with confidence that a larger percentage of males than females in the general population also would rather see a character get sliced and diced.
* The most basic type of probability sample is a **simple random sample** in which every member of a population has a known and equal chance of being included in the study. For example, if we simply take the names of all 40 students in your class and put them in a hat and draw one out, each member of your class has a 1 in 40 chance of being included in the sample. In most studies the population from which the sample will be drawn is too large for a hat, so marketers use a computer program to generate a random sample from a list of members of the population.
* Sometimes researchers use a **systematic sampling** procedure in which they select the nth member of a population after a random start. For example, if we want a sample of 10 members of your class, we might begin with the second person on the roll and select every fourth name after that; that is, the second, the sixth, the tenth, the 14th, and so on. Researchers know that studies that use systematic samples are just as accurate as simple random samples. Unless a list of members of the population of interest is already in a computer data file, it is a lot simpler to create a systematic sample. 
* Another type of probability sample is **a stratified sample** in which a research divides the population into segments that are related to the study's topic. For example, imagine that you are interested in studying what movies are most likely by members of a population. You know from prevvious studies that men and women in the population differ in their attitude toward different types of movies--men like action flicks and women like romances. To create a stratified sample, you would first divde the population into male and female segments. **Then respondents from each of the two segments would be selected randomly in proportion to their percentage of the population.** In this way, you have created a sample that is proportionate to the population on a characteristic that you know will make a difference in the study results.
* **Cluster sampling** also divides a population into groups, but in this approach the groups are representative microcosms of a population, in that each reflects the characteristics of the population as a whole. **In cluster sampling the population is divded into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subpopulations and then a subset of the groups is chosen using a probability sampling technique like a simple random sample. Respondents are then chosen within the groups using another probability sampling technique.** Cluster sampling is quite cost effective because you only have to create a sampling frame (list of potential respondents) for the cluster groups chosen. **Political pollsters use cluster sampling to make national assessments of party popularity based on the responses of a few hundred voters.**
* **NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING** Sometimes researchers do not feel that the time and effort required to develop a probability sample are justified, perhaps because they need an answer quickly or they just want to get a general sense of how people feel about a topic. They may choose a non-probability sample, **which entails the use of personal judgment in selecting respondents--in some cases just asking whomever they can find**. With a non-probability sample, some members of the population have no chance at all of being included in the sample. Thus, there is no way to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. **Results from non-probability studies can be generally suggestive of what is going on in the real world but not necessarily definitive.**
* A **convenience sample** is a non-probability sample composed of individuals who just happen to be available when and where the data are being collected. For example, if you simply stand in fron of the student union and ask students who walk by to complete you questionnaire, that would be a convenience sample.

Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing
* The purpose of this mini-project is to familarize you with research techniques used by marketers and to help you apply these techniques to managerial decision making.
1. With a group of three other students in your class, select a small retail business or fast-food restaurant to use as a "client" for your project. Be sure to get the manager's permission before conducting your research. Then choose a topic from among the following possibilities to develop a study problem:

        * Employee-customer interactions
        * The busiest periods of customer activity
        * Customer perceptions of service
        * Customer likes and dislikes about offerings
        * Customer likes and dislikes about the environment in the place of business
        * The benefits customers perceive to be important
        * The age groups that frequent the place of business
        * The age groups that frequent the place of business
        * The buying habit of a particular age group
        * How customer complaints are handled

2. Develop a plan for the research:

        a. Define the problem as you will study it
        b. Choose the type of research you will use
        c. Select the techniques you will use to gather data
        d. Develop the mode and format for data collection

3. Conduct the research
4. Write a report or develop a class presentation that includes four parts.

        a. Introduction: a brief overview of the business and the problem studied
        b. Methodology: The type of research used, the techniques used to gather data (and why they were chosen), the instruments and procedures used, the number of respondents, duration of the study, and other details that would allow someone to replicate your study.
        c. Results: a compilation of the results (perhaps in table form) and the conclusions drawn
        d. Recommmendations: A list of recommendations for actions management might take based on the conclusions drawn from the study.

Real People, Real Surfers: Explore the Web
* Monitoring changes in demographics and other consumer trends is an important part of the marketing intelligence included in an MIS. Today, much of this information is gathered by government research and is available on the Internet.
* Statistics Canada provides talbed data for Canadian cites at its site, **www.statcan.ca**. Using both Statistics Canada data and any other data you can find on the Internet, develop a report on a Canadian city of your choice that answers the following questions:

        1.What is the total population of the city
        2. Describe the population of the area in terns of age, income, education, ethnic background, marital status, occupation, and housing
        3. How does the city compare to the demographic characteristics of the entire Canadian populatiokn
        4. What is your opinion of the different websites you used? How useful are they to marketers? How easy were they to navigate? Was  there information you wanted that was not available? Was there more or less information from the sites than you had anticipated? Explain

# CHAPTER 5: Consumer Buying Behaviour

## UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS
* Compelling new products, clever packaging, and creative advertising surround us, clamouring for our attention--and our money. But consumers don't all respond in the same way to marketing activies. Each consumer is a unique person, with unique reasons for choosing one product over another. As Ron Outerbridge of Coast Tire knows, the first step in building long-term relationships is understanding your customer. Recall that the focus of the marketing concept is to satisfy consumers' wants and needs. **These wants and needs can be satisfied only to the extent that marketers understand why and how people buy products.** D-Code, for example, is a Canadian research firm that helps Canadian marketers understand 18- to 34-year-old "Nexus" consumers by answering such questions as, What are the attitudes and lifestyles of Nexus consumers, why do they prefer certain products, which ads do they respond to, and how do they purchase products? Uthink, another Canadian marketing research and strategy firm, offers similar services to help marketers understand 13- to 29-year-old. **Consumer behaviour is the process individuals or groups go through to select, purchase, and use goods, services, ideas, or experiences**. Marketers recognize that consumer behaviour is an ongoing process--it is more than what happens at the moment a consumer hands over money and, it turn, receives a good or service.
* Although it seems as if some purchases are made spontaneously (and we may regret our rashness later), **in reality we make most buying decisions only after we have undergone a series of steps--problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, product choice, and post-purchase evaluation.**
* Let's look at an example of a consumer purchase--one you yourself probably make on a regular basis: dry cereal. While this may seem like a simple purchase, in reality there are quite a few steps in the process that cereal marketers need to understand. The first decision in the process is where to buy your cereal. If you eat a lot of cereal, you may choose to make a special trip to a wearehouse-type retailer, such as Costco, that sells very large boxes of cereal. Of course, if you get a yearning for cereal in the middle of the night, you may dash to the local convenience store. Then there is the decision of the type of cereal. Do you eat only low-fat, high-fibre bran cereals, or do you go for sugar-coated varieties with marshmallows? As you can see, the purchase decision for something as simple as cereal can actually be quite complicated.
* Traditionally, researchers have tried to understand how consuemrs make decisions by assuming that people carefully collect information about competing products, determine which products possess the characteristics or product attributes important to their needs, weigh the pluses and minuses of each alternative, and arrive at a satisfactory decision. But how accurate is this picture of the decision-making process?
* Although it does seem that people undergo these steps when making an important purchase, is it realistic to assume that they do this for everything they buy? Researchers now realize that consumers actually possess a set of decision approaches, ranging from painstaking analysis to pure whim, depending on the importance of what is being bought and how much effort the person is willing to put into the decision. Researchers have found it convenient to think in terms of an "effort" continuum, which is anchored on one end by habitual (or routine) decision making (such as deciding t o purchase a can of pop) and at the other end by extended problem solving (such as deciding to purchase a computer). Many decisions fall somewhere in the middle and are characterized by **limited problem solving, which means that consumers do work to make a decision, but most likely rely on simple rules of thumb instead of learning about and conisdering all the ins and outs of every product alternative. For most of use, the dry cereal purchase decision described above falls into the limited problem solving category.** Some Internet marketers believe that the Internet can reduce the effort needed to make product decisions by offering so many products and services in one place. 
* **Involvement** Determines the extend of effort a person puts into deciding what to buy. Involvement is the importance of the perceived consequences of the purchase to the person. **As a rule, we are more involved in the decision-making process for products that we perceive as being important, pleasurable, or risky in some way.** Perceived risk may be present if the product is expensive, complex, and hard to understand, or if the purchase of the wrong product could result in embarrassment or social rejection. For instance, some people perceive clothing purchases as risky because they feel a wrong choice could lead to negative social consequences. Perceived risk can also be a factor in the buying process for certain products. A study of condom buying among Canadian university students, for example, found that 66 percent of men and 60 percent of women reported being embarrassed when buying condoms and, therefore, do not buy them. As one researcher put it, "Approaching the cashier is the moment of truth. There is also the worry that a 'price check on a 12-pack of Durex condom' will be announced to the entire store". Marketers will sometimes refer to high- or low-involvement product, but this is misleading. **Products are not high or low involvement--decision are. What is a high-involvement decision for one consumer may be a low involvement decision for another.** Bill Gate, for example, probably doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about what type of television to buy. When marketers say that a car is high-involvement product, they really mean it is a high-involvement decision for most consumers.
* When perceived risk is low, as in buying a pack of gum, the consumer feels low involvement in the decision-making process, the consumer is not overly concerned about which option he or she chooses because it is not especially important or risky. **In low-involvement situations, the consumer's decision is often a response to environmental cues, such as deciding to try a new type of chewing gum because it is prominently displayed at a store checkout counter.** Under these circumstances, managers must concentrate on how products are displayed at the time of purchase to influence the decision maker. **For example, a chewing gum marketer may decide to spend or to change the color of the gum wrapper to a bright pink to be sure it gets noticed among the other gums.**
* For other purchase decisions, such as for a house, car computer, or interview suit, the consumer is more likely to carefully process all the available information and to have thought about the decision well before buying the item. **The consequences of the purchase are important and risky, especially because a bad decision can result in significant financial losses, aggravation, decreased performance, or embarrassment. These types of purchase decisions are high involvement decisions.** Products are not inherently high or low involvement, but the level of involvement engaged by a consumer is often associated with the price, importance, and perceived risk of the purchase decision. So for products purchased with a high-involvement decision process, managers must start to reduce perceived risk by educating the consumer about why their product is the best choice well in advance of the time that the consumer is ready to make a decision. To understand what goes on during each of the steps in the decision-making process, in the next section we'll follow the fortunes of one consumer, a student named Emma, who is in the market for a new notebook computer. This is a high-involvement purchase decision for her because of the cost of the product and because the performance of the computer will have an important impact on her own performance in courses and, perhaps, in future jobs.

## Problem Recognition
* Problem recognition occurs whenever the consumer sees a significant difference between their current state of affairs and some desired or ideal state. The consumer needs to solve a problem, which may be small or large, simple or complex. Emma has a problem. She needs t o have a computer for writing papers, doing research on the Internet, and sending e-mail, but the computers provided on campus are always busy when she needs a computer the most, such as at the end of term. Emma also wants her computer to be portable so that she can use it to take notes in classes and take it to the library while she researches her assignments. Thinking about the future, Emma realizes that, in her job, she will probably have a lot of work to do after hours. having a notebook computer will allow her to do the work in the comfort of her own apartment.
* Do marketing decisions have a role in buyers' problem recognition? Although most problem recognition occurs spontaneously, **marketers can develop creative advertising messages that stimulate consumers to recognize that their current state--that old car--just doesn't equal a shiny, new convertible**

                PR1: Encourage consumers to see that existing state does not equal desired state
                PR2: TV commercials showing the excitement of owning a new car
                IS1: Provide information when and where consumers are likely to search
                IS2: Targeted advertising on TV programs with hih target market viewership; Sales training that ensures knowledgeable salespeople; make new car brochures available inn dealer showrooms; design exciting, easy to navigate, and informative websites
                EA1: Understand the criteria consumers use in comparing brands and commmunicate own brand superiority
                EA2: Conduct research to identify most immportant evaluative criteria; create advertising that includes reliable data on superiority of a brand (e.g., kilometres per litre, safety, comfort)
                PC1: Understand choice heuristics used by consumers and provide communication that encourages brand decision

                PPE1: Encourage accurate consumer expectations; 
                PPE2: Provide honest advertising and sales presentation

## Information Search
* Once Emma recognizes her computer problem, she needs adequate information to resolve it. During the information search part of the decision-making process, **consumers check their memory and survey the environment to identify what options exist to solve the problem. Marketing communication helps consumers in this task, and many advertisements are focused on generating awareness about brands.** When Virgin Mobile launched its new Virgin brand cellphone service in Canada, it kicked off its campaign with an innovative publicity stunt to create immediate awareness for its brand. Attached to a wire and dressed as Captain Canada, Richard Branson, the chair and founder of Virgin Group, jumped from a 15-storey media tower in Toronto's Dundas Square, and then proceeded to ride a monster truck over three cars representing his company's wireless competition. For her information search, Emma might rely on ads she has seen for notebook computers, recommendations from friends, and additional research she might do by reading Consumer reports and PC Magazine, or by signing onto websites for companies, such as Dell Canada and Apple Canada. She also might vist some electronics stores, like Future Shop, where she can discuss her purchase with salespeople and try out some computers.
* Increasingly, consumers are using Internet search engines, portals, or "shopping bots" for information search. Search engines are sites such as Google, AltaVista, and Webcrawler that find information on the web by searching sites for keywords. Other sites such as Expedia simplify searches because they organize information from a lot of separate websites according to common themes. Consider the purchase of a new car. The car dealer was once the key source of information during the information search stage of a new car purchase. Now, most new car purchasers visit a car dealership only after extensive research on the Internet.
* When they understand the stages of the consumer decision process, marketers can develop strategies to lead consumers to a choice that pleases both the consumer and the marketer.
* Some portals, such as Yahoo Kids, focus on specific customer segments. This unique portal makes it easy for kids to access information relevant to them, such as homework tips, games, and music. The site include a feature called "Ask Earl", where kids can type in any question, such as "What is plagiarism?" and receive an answer back, written in language that is easy for them to understand. Yahoo Canada recently launched a new site aimed at women aged 24 to 54. The site includes content from Canadian sources such as Chatelaine and Today's Parent, as well as U.S. sources such as Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray. The site also includes blogs from personality like athlete Gabby Reece, plus a question and answer feature.
* Robots, also called "shopbots", or "intelligence agents", are software programs used by some websites that find Internet retailers selling a particular product. The programs troll the web for information and then "report" it back to the host site. Some of these sites also provide information on competitors' price, and may even ask customers to rate the various retailers they have listed to provide recommendations for other consumers to rate the varius retailers and which are less than desirable. We should note, however, that some sites do not wish to compete on price and don't give bot access. Emma, in her search for a personal computer, could visit ComputersCanada.com to quickly search computer prices across Canada. **The role of marketers during the information search phase of the decision process is to make sure that information about their brand is available when and where consumers look.** Most manufacturers make sure information about their newest models is on the web, is advertised frequently in dealer flyers and magazines, and of course, is available in deal showrooms
* Information search is often an ongoing process, and this stage may be more extensive and intensive for some consumers than others. It ends with identification of alternatives for consideration, called the consideration set.

## Evaluation of Alternatives
* Once consumers have identified the set of product they are interested in, they narrow down their choices by deciding which of all the possibilities are feasible and evaluating the remaining alternatives. Emma might want a top-of-the-line notebook, like Dell XPS, but she realizes that her student budget doesn't allow for such a purchase. As she looks around, she decides that the notebooks she likes in her price range are the Apple MacBook, the Compaq Presario, and the Gateway Solo. She has narrowed down her options by considering only affordable notebooks.
* Now, Emma has to choose. It's time for her to look mroe systematically at each of the three possibilities and identify the important characteristics, or evaluative criteria, she will use to decide among them. These may be the power of the computer, its weight, the size of the monitor, the battery life, the warranty offered, or even the computer's design or color options. During her evaluation, Emma learns that the Apple product, the MacBook, seem to her to have a lot of the features she is looking for. judging from the ad, it appears that it has all the great features of other notebooks, but with much greater speed.
* **Marketers often play a role in educating consumers about which product characteristics should be used as evaluative criteria--usually, they emphasize the dimensions in which their product excels. Where Compaq Presario might focus on price because it is one of the least expensive notebook computers available, Apple is educating consumers about the value of their new operating system.**

## Product Choice
* But how do consumers like Emma actually apply their evaluative criteria? Some consumers use **heuristics (mental short-cut)** to simplify the evaluation process--**taking the advice of someone else, buying the cheapest brand or the most expensive brand (assuming that price reflects quality), or buying the one that "feels" right (has the greatest emotional appeal)** Perhaps the most common heuristic is just buying the brand a consumer always buys--either through habit or through brand loyalty. Consumers are brand loyal when they make repeat brand purchase because they believe that brand is superior, have such strong preferences that they will pay more or search harder to find that brand, and feel that it's not worth the effort to consider competing options. The creation of brand loyalty is a prized goal for marketers. People form preferences for a favourite brand and then may literally never change their minds in the course of a lifetime, making it extremely difficult for rivals to persuade them to switch. Loyal customers are very valuable--as loyalty increases, consumers will buy at least twice as much as those who are just slightly less atteched to the brand, and often three to four times more. The most loyal customers can be worth up to 20 times more than other consumers. Some people take the concept of brand loyalty even further. At a recent lecture, Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide CEO Kevin Robers stressed his belief that the job of marketers is to "create loyalty beyond reason", to move their products and services "from being irreplaceable to irresistible" The success of the iPod illustrates this concept clearly--despite being critically viewed as not being the best MP3 availble, the iPod continues t o dominate the market.
* Many companies are now employing customer relationship management (CRM) strategies to help them organize and manage their relationship with their customers. CRM helps companies target their best customers and form ongoing relationships with them in the hope of increasing loyalty and improving customer satisfaction. CRM will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.
* Another heuristic that is often used by consumers is **based on country of origin**. We assume that a product has certain characteristics if it comes from a certain country. In the car category, many peoiple associate German cars with fine engineering and Swedish cars with safety.
* Other consumers put more thought into their purchase decision and have key criteria that absolutely have to be met. Emma, for example, is considering only laptop or notebook computers and is not willing to consider a desktop model. In doing so, she is applying a **non compensatory evaluation strategy**--where a consumer is unwilling to make trade-offs on product attributes such as getting a faster processor, more memory, and a larger hard drive for a lower price on a desktop computer. A compensatory strategy is where consumers are willing to make trade-offs to get the best overall deal (value) for their needs. There are different types of compensatory and non-compensatory strategies and many consumers use a mix of these strategies, even within the same decision process. These are summarized below

        Compensatry: 
                1. *Decision Rule:* Simple Additive, Sum the scores of each brand rating on each attribute, choose the brand with the highest overall score. 
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop brands with strong overall value; 2. Help consumers compare brands to make the overall value choice.
                
                2. *Decision Rule*: Weighted additive: give weights to each criteria, for each bran multiply the rating and the weight, sum the scores and choose the brand with the highest overall score.
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the criteria weights and design products that excel on those criteria. Position your product on the key criteria; 2. Try to change the weights of criteria to make them more or less important in the minds of customers--such as Intel did with the Intel Inside campaign

        Non-Compensatory: 
                1. *Decision Rule*: Lexicographic: Rank the decision criteria: evaluate the brands on the most important criteria. Choose the brand with the highest rating on the most important criteria. If there is a tie, go on to the next most important criteria until a brand is chosen
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the top three or four most important criteria for your target market and continuously innovate to lead on those criteria. 2. If you are not the leader, try to change consumer attitude about the importance of the criteria or try to get them to adopt a different evaluative strategy.

                2. Elimination by Aspects: Rank the decision criteria, and determine minimal acceptable levels for each criterion. Keep in the evoked set brands that meet the minimum level of the most important criteria. Go on to the next most important criteria until there is only one brand in the consideration set and choose that brand.
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the most important criteria for your target market and continuously innovate to be clsoe to the leader on the top criterion. 2. Try to establish a criterion in the minds of consumers where your commpetitors are not able to compete effectively. Demostrate that your brand exceeds typical minimum standard on key criteria

                3. *Decision Rule*: Conjunctive: Determine minimal acceptable levels for each criterion. Keep in your evoked set brands that meet or exceed the minimal level on all criteria. If there is a tie, add criteria or raise the minimum
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the criteria and minimum levels. Continuously innovate to meet minimum levels on all criteria. Innovate to develop features or functions not provided by competitors. Try to establish these features or functions as criteria in the evaluation process.

        Heuristics 
                *Decision Rule*:Habit: Buy the brand you bought last time: Make your brand available; 
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop strong brand recognition; remind consumers that this is their brand

                *Decision Rule*: Price: Buy the cheapest or most expensive brand
                *Marketing Implication*: Innovate to keep a low cost structure and position your brand as the value leader--or position your brand as a premium brand and support the quality inference through marketing communication

                *Decision Rule*: Affect: Buy the brand that "feels" right
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop strong emotional connections to your brand through packaging and marketing communication

                *Decision Rule*: Recommendation: Buy the brand that someone says is best.
                *Marketing Implication*: Market to the opinion leaders and market mavens. Provide incentives or recognition for referrals.

* Emma has spent several weeks thinking about the alternatives, and she's finally ready to take the plunge and buy! After agonizing over her choice, she decides that, even though the Gateway and Dell laptops were rated highly by Consumer Reports, the Apple MacBook just feels right. It meets all the basic technical criteria and it appeals to her sense of individuality. The MacBook is the lighest of all the options and will easily fit in her backpack. She signs onto the Apple Canada website and buys her notebook computer. A few days later the computer arrives at her door. In the end, Emma used a mix of decision strategy (lexigraphic, conjunctive, and heruristics) to make her purchase decision

## Post-Purchase Evaluation
* In the last stage of decision making, the consumer evaluation the quality of the decision made. After mulling over the alternatives and picking one, they evaluate just how good a choice it was. Everyone has experience cognitive dissonance (regret, or buyer's remorse) after making a purchase and (hopefully) we have all been pleased with something we've bought. Marketers pay particular attention to cognitive dissonance, as they want consumers to have enduring positive attitude toward the brands they have purchased so they become loyal consumers--reducing the cost of marketing in the future and reducing the likelihood of the consumer switching to another brand. Cognitive dissonance is greatest when decisions are important and there are other viable brands in the consideration set. **Through marketing communication strategies that reaffirm consumers in what a good decision they made, marketers try to reduce or minimize cognitive dissonance.**
* The evaluation fo the product results in a level of consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction, which is determined by the overall feelings, or attitude, a person has about a product after purchasing it. In this case, fortunately, Emma's feelings couldn't be better. Her computer is reliable and easy to use, and its light weight means that she can easily carry it to her classes.
* Just how do consumers decide if they are satisfied with their purchases? One answer would be, "That's easy. The product is either wonderful, or it isn't" **However, it's a little more complicated than that. When consuemrs buy a prodcut, they have some expectation of product quality. How well a product or service meets or exceeds these expectations determines customer satisfaction. In other words, consumers assess product quality by comparing what they have bought to a performance standard created by a mixture of information from marketing communications, informal information sources such as friends and family, and their own experience with the product category.**
* So, even though Emma's new MacBook is not as powerful as some of the other options she considered, she's happy with her purchase because it meets or exceeds her expectations. Emma has completed the consumer decision making process by recognizing a problem, conducting an information search to resolve it, identifying the feasible alternatives, amking a product choice, and then evaluating the quality of her decision.

## OTHER DECISION PROCESSES
* **Emma's computer purchase was an example of a high-involvement, extended problem-solving decision that typically follows the process outlined above** But marketers know that not all consumer decisions are well researched and thought through. **Some people make emotional or affective (feeling-based) decisions like buying a car because it looks good, or buying a new dress because it's cute.** For example, Mazda Canada has recently tried to differentiate the company based on emotion--remaking their image from boring high-quality cars to fun, hip, and sporty high-quality cars--with "Zoom-Zoom". Other people make impulse decisions, acting without giving a lot of thought to the decision--grabbing a chocolate bar at a grocery checkout counter or deciding to play a video game after walking past an arcade.
* A framework developed by the Foote, Cone, and Belding advertising agency offers a useful way of looking at these different consumer decision processes. The FCB grid identifies thinking (cognition) and feeling (affect) as two primary approaches to consumer decision making, for both high- and low-involvement decisions. The four quadrants of the resulting 2 X 2 matrix represent four common decision appraoches: **informative decisions, affective decisions, habitual or responsive decisions, and sel-satisfaction or impulse decisions.** These approaches differ in the order in which consumers learn about brands (evaluate brands and establish beliefs), feel about brands (emotional response or attachment), and act to purchase brands. The extended problem-solving model is represented in Quadrant 1. **Decisions in this quadrant are made using rational thinking and extensive evaluation of alternatives using information and data.** The purchase of a new car or house would fall into this quadrant for most people. In Quadrant 2, consuemrs have emotional responses or attachments to brands and then learn enough about them to decide whether or not to buy them. Purchases in this qudrant are often made based on emotion rather than information. For many people the purchase of jewellery or other high-fashion apparel might fall into this quadrant. **In Quadrants 3 and 4, consumers act first, then evaluate or interpret (feeling) the outcomes.** While the FCB model has been criticized for being simplistic, not accounting for consumer experience, and not accounting well for negative emotions, **many marketers find it useful to include in segment profiles because of its strategy implications.** **Informative decisions (Quadrant 1), for example, are aided by marketers: providing specific and detailed information; providing product demonstrations; and making direct comparisons to alternatives. Other communication strategy implications will be discussed in Chapter 12 (Integrated Marketing Communication).**

## WHAT INFLUENCES CONSUMER DECISIONS?
As well as understanding the mechanics of the consumer decision-making process, marketers try to ascertain what influences in consumers' lives affect this process. There are three main categories: **internal, situational, and social influences**. In Emma's case, for example, the evaluative criteria she used to compare notebook computers and her feeling about each computer may have been influenced by such internal factors as **her desire to be unique, such situational factors as her satisfaction with the information and service provided on the Apple Canada website, and such social influences as her prediction that her friends would be impressed when they saw her taking notes in class on a new notebook computer.** Figure below shows the influences in the deicison-making process and emphasizes that all of these factors work toegether to affect the ultimate choice each person makes. Let's consider how each of these three types of influence works, starting with internal factors.

        Internal Influence: Perception, Motivation, Learning, Attitude, Personality, Age groups, Lifestyle
        Social Influence: Cultures, subculture, social class, group memberships
        Situational influence: physical environment, time
                                                                =====> Decision Process ====> PURCHASE

### Internal Influence on Consumer Decisions
* People associate the textures of fabrics and other surfaces with product qualities, and **some marketers are exploring how touch can be used in packaging to arouse consumer interest.** Some new plastic containers for household beauty items incorporate "soft touch" resins that provide a soft, frition-like resistance when held. Focus group members who tested one such package for Clairol's new Daily Defense shampoo described the sensations as "almost sexy" and were actually reluctant to let go of the containers. That's a powerful impact for a piece of plastic. Now we will examine how internal factors relating to the way people absorb and interpret information influence the decision-making process.
* **PERCEPTION**: Perception is the process by which people select, organize and interpret information from the outside world. We receive information in the form of sensations, the immediate response of our sensory receptors--eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and fingers--to such basic stimuli as light, color, and sound. Our impressions about products often are based on their physical qualities. We try to make sense of the sensations we receive by interpreting them in light of our past experiences. For example, Emma chose the Apple notebook computer partly because of its distinctive design, which she associates with style and individuality.
* **The perception process has important implications for marketers because, as consumers absorb and make sense of the vast quantities of information competing for their attention, it is likely that they won't notice any one marketing message.** And, if they do notice it, there's no guarantee that the meaning they give it will be quite the same one the marketer intended. **The issues that marketers need to understand during this process include *exposure, perceptual selection, and interpretation*.**
* Explosure: The stimulus must be within range of people's sensory receptors to be noticed. For example, **the lettering on a billboard must be big enough for a passing motorist to read easily, or the message will be lost.** Many people believe (falsely) that even messages they can't see will persuade them to buy advertised products. Claims about subliminal advertising, involving messages hidden in ice cubes, among other places, have been surfacing since the 1950s. Although many consumers believe in subliminal advertising and are convinced this technique can get them to buy things they do not really want, there is little evidence of its use or even evidence that this technique would work even if it were used. **Images that can be perceived are so effective that marketers really do not even consider subliminal effects.**
* Perceptual Selection: Consumers choose to pay attention to some stimuli but not to others. Consumers are more likely to be aware of messages that speak to their current needs. **A newspaper ad for a fast food restaurant that would go unoticed after lunch may grab your attention if you sneak a glance at  the paper during a class that ends at lunchtime.**
* Interpretation: Meaning is assigned to the stimulus. This meaning is influenced by prior associations the person has learned. The Benetton ad is a great example of how these assumptions alter our interpretations. Although the ad shows two men handcuffed to each other, some people assumed that the black man was cuffed to the white man, and the company was the target of many complaints about racisum after the ad appeared.
* **MOTVATION**: **Motivation is an internal state that drives us to satisfy needs. Once we activate a need, a state of tension exists that drives the consumer toward some goal that will reduce this tension by eliminating the need.** For example, Emma began to experience a gap between her present state--having to rely on the computers on campus--and a desired state--having a computer that allow her to work at home and on campus. The need for a new notebook computer was activated, which motivated Emma to test and learn about different models, to talk with friends about their experiences with notebook computers, and finally to buy a new notebook computer.

        Nikon Camera---"Feel like a Pro"            Self Actualization: Self-fulfillment, enriching experiences
        TELUS---"For the most important calls in the world--Yours"    Ego Needs: Prestige, status, accomplishment
        Molson---"True Canadian taste from Canada's oldest brewery"         Belonging: Love, friendship, acceptance by others
        Ombrelle Sunscree---"The sun protection most recommended by health professionals"   Safety: Security, shelter, protection
        Quaker Oat Bran---"It's the right thing to do"    Physiological: Water, sleep, food

* Psychologist Abraham Maslow developed an influential approach to motivation. Maslow formulated a hierarchy of needs, which categorizes motives according to five levels of importance, the more basic needs being on the bottom of the hierarchy and higher needs at the top. The hierarchy suggests that before a person can meet needs in a given level, they must first (at least partially) meet the needs in  the levels below. This approach shows individuals starting at the lowest level with basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter and then progress to higher levels to satisfy more complex needs, such as the need to be accepted by others or to feel good about themselves. Ultimately, people can reach t he highest-level needs and they will be motivated to attain such goals as spiritual fulfillment. As the figure above shows, **if marketers understand teh particular level of needs that is relevant to consumers in their target market**, they can tailor their product and messages to point out how these needs can be satisfied. In 1969 Clayton Alderfer proposed a revision to Maslow's need hierarchy based on empirical evidence (concern with basic material existence requirements), Relatedness (desire we have for maintaining interpersonal relationships), and Growth (intrinsic desire for personal development). He also recognized that more than one need may be motivational at the same time and that if higher order needs are not satisfied, people will compensate with satifying more lower order needs.
* **LEARNING**: Learning is a change in behaviour after gaining information or experience. Learning about products can occur deliberately, as when we set out to gather information about different MP3 players before buying one brand. We also learn even when we are not trying. Consumers recognize many brand names and can hum many product jingles, for example, even for products they do not use. Psychologists who study learning have advanced several theories to explain the learning process, and because a major goal for marketers is to "teach" consumers to prefer their products, these perspectives are important. In this section, we'll briefly review the most important perspectives on how people learn.
* Behavioural learning: Behavioural learning theories assume that learning takes place as the result of connections that form between events perceived by the individual. In one type of behavioural learning, *classical conditioning*, a person perceives two stimuli at about the same time. After a while, the person transfers his or her presonse from one stimulus to the other. **For example, an ad shows a product and a breathtaking beautiful scene, so that (the marketer hopes) you will transfer the positive feelings you get from looking at the scene to the advertised product.** Another common form of behavioural learning is called *operant conditioning*, which occurs when people learn that their actions result in rewards or punishments. This feedback influences how they will respond in similar situations in the future. Just as a rat in a maze learns the route to a piece of cheese, consumers who receive a reward, such as a prize in the bottom of a box of cereal, will be more likely to buy the brand again. The feedback acts as a reinforcement for the behaviour. Behaviour modification is similar to operant conditioning, only the reward is offered up front to encourage the desired behaviour.
* The learned associations in classical and operant conditioning, also have a tendency to transfer to other similar stimuli in a process called *stimulus generalization*. This means that the good or bad feelings associated with a product will "rub off" on other products that resemble it. **For example, some marketers create product line extension, in which new products share the name of an established brand so that people's good feeling about the current product will transfer to the new one. Dole, which is associated with fruit, was able t o introduce refrigerated juices and juice bar; Sun Maid branched out from raisins to raisin bread.**
* Cognitive learning: In contrast to behavioural theories of learning, cognitive learning theory views people as problem solvers who do more than passively react to associations between stimuli. Supporters of this viewpoint stress the role of creativity and insight during the learning process. One type of cognitive learning theory is *observational learning*, (also called vicarious learning), **which occurs when people watch the actions of others and note what happens to them as a result. They store these observations in memory and, at some later point, use the information to guide their own behaviour, especially when they admire or identify with these people in some way. Many promotional strategies centre on endorsements by movie stars, athletes, and music idols whose fans have observed their successes.**
* **ATTITUDES**: An attitude is a lasting evaluation of a person, object, or issue. Consumers have attitudes toward very product-specific behaviours, such as using Crest toothpaste rather than Colgate, as well as toward general consumption related behaviours, such as how often to brush one's teeth.
* A person's attitude has three commponents: affect, cognition, and behaviour. In a marketing context, affect is the overall feeling a person has about a product. Cognition is the beliefs and knowledge the person has about the product. Behaviour is what happens when the person takes action by buying or using the product.
* Depending on the nature of the product, one of these three components--feeling, knowing, or doing--will be the dominant influence in creating an attitude toward a product. **Affect** is usually **dominant for expensive products** that we use to say something about ourselves (such as perfume), in which the way the product makes us feel determines our attitude toward it. **Cognition** may be more important for **complex products, such as computers, which require us to process technical information.** Behaviour often determines attitudes for commonly purchased, low-involvement items, such as chewing gum, for which we often form an **attitude based simply on how the product tastes or performs**.
* **PERSONALITY**: Personality is the set of unique psychological characteristics that consistently influences the way a person responds to situations in the environment. One adventure seeking consumer may always be on the lookout for new experiences and cutting-edge products, while another is happiest in familiar surroundings, using the same brand repeatedly. To appeal to thrill seekers who like to break the rules, Isuzu positioned its Rodeo sport utility vehicle as a car that lets a driver break the rules. Advertising was created to support this idea by showing kids jumping in mud puddles, running with scissors, and coloring out the lines. For marketers, identifying difference in personality contribute value to crafting marketing strategies. Some specific characteristics, called personality traits, that are relevant to marketing strategies include **innovativeness, self-confidence, and sociability**
* Innovativeness: Innovativeness is the degree to which a person likes to try new things. Cutting-edge products, suchas radical new hairstyles and fashions, might appeal to innovative people
* Self-Confidence: Self-confidence is the degree to which a person has a positive evaluation of his or her abilities, including the ability to make a good product decision. People who don't have much self-confidence are good candidates for the services of image consultants, who assist in making the right choices.
* Sociability: Sociability is the degree to which a person enjoys social interaction. A social person might, for example, respond to entertainment-related products that cliam to bring people together or make parties more fun. 

* The notion that consumers buy products that are extensions of their personality traits make sense. Marketers try to create brand personalities to appeal to different types of consumers. The ad for Benjamin Moore paint, for example, position its brand of paint as a way of expressing personality and style.
* How we feel about our own personalities strong influence our purchasing decisions. We may buy a certain type of clothing statement about who we are. A person's self-concept is his or her attitude about the self. The self-concept is his or her attitude about the self. The self-concept is composed of a mixture of beliefs about one's abilities, observations of one's own behaviour, and feelings (usually both positive and negative) about one's personal attributes, such as body type or facial features. The extend to which a person's self-concept is positive or negative can influence the products he or she buys.
* In developing a new line of snack cake, Sara Lee found that consumers who had negative self-concept preferred portioned snack items because they felt they lacked the self-control to regulate how much they ate. **On the more positive side, self-esteem advertising attempts to stimulate positive feelings about the self. This technique is used by Kellogg's to position Special K cereal as a lifestyle choice.** Kellogg's attempts to counter negative self-esteem by making consumers feel good about themselves and feel good about the product, while promoting a healthy lifestyle. This message has recently been adapted to position Special K as part of a low-carb lifestyle. Dove's "Campaign for Real Beauty" centred around the belief that beauty could be relfected in different shapes, sizes, and ages. The brand's mission statement is "to make more women feel beutiful every day, by widening today's sterotypical view of beauty and inspiring women to take great care of themselves." The campaign was very successful and changed the way women defined beauty.

7. Many Canadians and consumers around the globe use C2C e-commerce to supplement their incomes or as their primary source of income. What do you think of the future of sites such as eBay? What opportunities does eBay provide for twenty-first-century entrepreneurs?

Marketing Practice: Applying What You've Learned
1. Assume that you are the director of marketing for a chain of camping and outdoor gear stores. Your firm is expanding and it is your job to develop general recommendations for store design. Prepare a summary of your recommendations for store design elements that you believe will provide the best shopping environment for your customers
2. Assume that you are an account executive with an advertising agency. Your current client is a firm that makes swimwear. You know that swimwear purchases are often influenced by a variety of social or "other people" factors. Write a report that list these social influences, explain why each is important, and outline how you might use these influence in developing an advertising campaign.
3. This chapter indicated that consumers go through a series of steps (from problem recognition to post-purchase evaluation) as they make purchases. Write a detailed report describing what you would do in each of these steps when deciding to purchase one of the following product

        a. an automobile
        b. a suit
        c. a vacation

4. Sometimes advertising or other marketing activities cause problem recognition to occur by showing consumers how much better off they would be with a new product or by pointing out problems with products they already own. For the following product categories, what are some ways in which marketers might try to stimulate problem recognition?

        a. cellphone
        b. toothpaste
        c. vitamins
        d. fast food

5. You work for a firm that markets frozen foods and are concerned about the effects of current consumer trends, including the increasingly diverse ethnic makeup of the population, changing roles of men and women, increased concern for time and for the environment, and decreased emphasis on owning status goods. Others in your firm do not understand or care about these changes. They believe that the firm should continue to do business just as it always has. Develop a role-playing exercise with a classmate to discuss these two different points of view for your class. Each of you should include the importance of each of these trends to your firm and your suggestions for marketing strategies to address these trends

Marketing Mini-Project Learning by Doing
* The purpose of this mini-project is to increase your understanding of the roles of personal, social, and situational factors in consumer behaviour.
1. With several other members of your class, select one of the following product categories (or some other product of your choice)

        a. perfume
        b. computers
        c. women's or men's shoes
        d. automobile

2. Visit three stores or locations where the product may be purchased (try to select three thatare very differernt from each other). Observe and make notes on all the elements of each retail environment.
3. At each of the three locations, observe people purchasing the product. Make notes about their characteristics (e.g., age and sex) and their actions in the store in relation to the product
4. Prepare a report for your class describing the situation variables and individual consumer differences you discovered and how they relate to the purchase of the product.
5. Present your findings to your class.

# CHAPTER 6: Organizational Buying Behaviour

## BUSINESS MARKETS: BUYING AND SELLING WHEN STAKES ARE HIGH
* You might think most marketers spend their days dreaming up the best way to promote cutting edge web browsers or funky shoes. Not so. Many marketers know that the "real action" is more likely to be found in lead pipes, offcie supplies, safety shoes, meat lockers, or machine tools. In fact, some of the most interesting and most lucrative jobs for young marketers are in industries you probably have never heard of.
* An individual consumer may decide to buy two or three T-shirts at one time, each emblazoned with a different design. Large companies such as Canadian Tire, Petro-Canada, Air Canada, and Cirque du Soleil buy hundreds, even thousands, of employee uniforms embroidered with their corporate logos in a single order. Like an end consumer, a business buyer makes decisions--with an important difference. The purchase may be worth millions of dollars, and both the buyer and seller have a lot at stake in making a wise decision.
* In this chapter, we'll look at the big picture of the business marketplace, in which the fortunes of business buyers and sellers can hang in the balance of a single transaction. Then we'll examine how marketers categorize businesses and organiations to develop effective business marketing strategies. Finally, we'll look at business buying behaviour and the business buying decision process. 
* To begin, consider these transactions: Moosehead Breweries, Canada's oldest independent brewery, sells its beer (such as Moosehead Lager) directly to food and beverage retailers and distributors. Procter & Gamble sells cases of Tide to RC Distributors, a Northern Ontario wholesaler. The Stratford Festival buys costumes, sets, and programs. Merck Frosst plans to purchase 1000 Dell computer systems for employee home use. BC Gas buys advice from Anderson Consulting. The Winnipeg Public Library buys a Canon copier. Rona buys drywall from the Canadian Gypsum Company.

## Characteristics That Make a Difference in Business Markets
* All of these market activities have one thing in common--they are part of business-to-business marketing. This is the marketing of goods and services that businesses and other organizational customers buy for some purpose other than personal consumption. Firms may resell these goods and services or may use them to produce still other goods and services to sell to other businesses or to support their own operations. Business-to-business customers include manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and a variety of other organizations such as hospitals, colleges and universities, and government agencies. Another name for business-to-business markets is organizational markets.
* Business customers create vast opportunities for marketers. When measured in dollars, the market for business and organizational goods and services is four times larger than the consumer market.
* To put the size and complexity of business markets into perspective, let's consider a single product--a pair of jeans. A consuemr may browse through several racks of jeans and ultimately purchase a single pair, but the store at which the consuemr shops has purchased many pairs of jeans in different sizes, styles, and brands from different manufacturers. Each of these manufacturers purchases fabrics, zippers, buttons, and thread from other manufacturers that, in turn, puchase the raw materials to make these components. In addition, all the firms in this chain need to purchase equipment, electricity, labour, computer systems, office supplies, packing materials, and countless other goods and services. So, even a single purchase of the latest style of Diesel jeans is the culmination of a series of buying and selling activities among many organizations--many people have been keeping busy while you're out shopping.
* In theory, the same basic marketing principles hold in both comnsumer and business markets--firms identify customer needs and develop a marketing mix to satisfy those needs. For example, imagine the company that made the desks and chairs in your classroom. Just like a firm that markets consumer goods, **the classroom furniture company first must create an important competitive advantage for its target market of colleges and universities.** Next the firm develops a marketing mix strategy beginning with a product--classroom furniture that will withstand years of use by thousands of students while providing a level of comfort required of a good learning environment. The firm must offer the furniture at prices the school will pay and must develop a sales force or other marketing commnication strategy to make sure your school (and hundreds of others) consider--and hopefully choose--its products when furnishing classrooms. Although marketing to business customers does have a lot in common with consumer marketing, there are differences that make this basic process more complex. 


| Organizational Markets  | Consumer Markets  |
|---|---|
| Purchases made for some purpose other than personal consumption  | Purchase for individual or household consumption  |
| Purchases made by someone other than the user of the product  | Purchase usually made by ultimate user of the product   |
| Decision frequently made by several people  | Decision usually made by individuals  |
| Purchase made according to precise technical specifications based on product expertise  | Purchases often made based on brand reputation or personal recommendations with little or no product expertise  |
| Purchases made after careful weighing of alternatives  | Purchases frequently made on impulse  |
| Purchases made based on rational criteria  | Purchases made based on emotional responses to products or promotions  |
| Purchasers often engage in lengthy decision process  | Individual purchasers often make quick decisions  |
| Interdependencies between buyers and sellers; long-term relationships  | Buyers engage in limited-term or one-time only relationships with many different sellers |
| Purhcases may involve competitve bidding, price negotiations, and complex financial arrangements  | Most purchases made at "list price" with cash or credit cards  |
| Product frequently purchased directly from producer  | Products usually purchased from someone other than producer of the product  |
| Purchases frequently involve high risk and high cost  | Most purchases are low risk and low cost  |
| Limited number of large buyers  | Many individual or household customers  |
| Buyers often geographically concentrated in certain areas  | Buyers generally dispersed throughout total population  |
| Product: often complex; classified based on how organizational customers use them  | Products: consumer goods and services for individual use  |
| Demand derived from demand for other goods and services, generally inelastic in the short run, subject to fluctuations, and may be joined to the demand for other goods and services  | Demand based on consumer needs and preferences, is generally price elastic, steady over time, and independent of demand for other products  |
| Promotion emphasizes personal selling  | Promotion emphasize advertising  |

* **MULTIPLE BUYERS** In busienss markets, **product often have to do more than satisfy an individual's needs. They must meet the requirements of everyone involved in the company' purchase decision.** If you decide to buy a new chair for your room or apartment, you are the only one who has to be satisfied. For your classroom, the furniture must satisfy students, faculty members, administrators, campus planners, and the purchasing department. Instead of simply deciding on an appropriate price for the product, business-to-business marketers frequently must submit written quuotes stating their prices and then hope a competitor doesn't submit a lower quote.
* **NUMBER OF CUSTOMER**: Compared to consumers, organizational customers are few and far between. In Canada, there are about 10 million consumer households but fewer than 50,000 busiensses and organizations. Unless your name is Bronfman or Gates, each organizational buyer has more to spend than you do as an individual consumer. Business marketers have a narrow customer base and a small number of buyers. Kodak's business division, which markets sophisticated medical products to hospitals and other medical groups, has a limited number of potential customers compared with its consumer film division.
* **SIZE OF PURCHASES** Business-to-business products can dwarf consumer purchases, both in the qunatity of items ordered and in the price of individual purchases. A company that supplies uniforms to other business, for example, buys hundreds of large drums of laundry detergent each year in contrast to a consumer household that buys one box of detergent every few weeks. Organizations purchase some products (e.g., highly sophisticated pieces of manufacturing equipment, computer-based marketing information systems) that can cost into the millions of dollars. For example, DALSA, which specializes in the design and manufacture of sophisticated electronic cameras, sells charge-coupled devices for $50,000. Recognizing such differences in the size of purchases allows marketers to meet business customers' needs. Although it makes perfect sense to use mass-media advertising to sell laundry detergent to consumers, **selling thousands of dollars worth of laundry detergent or a million-dollar computer is best handled by a strong personal sales force.**
* **GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION** Another difference between business markets and consuemr markets is geographic concentration--many business customers are located in a small geographic area rather than spread out across the country. Consumers buy and use products like toothpaste and televisions whether they live in the heart of Toronot or in a small fishing village on Price Edward island. This is not true for business-to-business customers, who may be exclusively located in a single region of the country. In Canada, much of the industrial buying power is concentrated in Toronto, Montreal, and Calgary, where major Canadian corporations have their head offices.

## Business-to-Business Demand
* Demand in business markets differs from consumer demand. Most demand for business-to-businessproducts is derived, inelastic, fluctuating, and joint. Understanding these differences in business-to-business demand is important for marketers in forecasting sales and in planning effective marketing strategies.
* **DERIVED DEMAND** Consumer demand is a direct connection between a need and the satisfaction of that need. Business customers don't purchase goods and services to satisfy their own needs. Business-to-business demand is **derived demand**, because **a business's demand for goods and services comes either directly or indirectly from consumer's demand**. For example, the demand for building products such as Canadian Gypsum's drywall or a sony home entertainment centre is derived from the demand for new hommes and luxury goods. Retailers buy goods to resell in response to consumer demand while other organizatinos and firms buy products that are used to produce still more goods and services that consumer markets demand.
* Consider example below. Demand for forestry products comes from the demand for pulp to make paper used to make textbooks. The demand for textbooks comes from the demand for education. **As a result of derived demand, the success of one company may depand on another company in a different industry. The derived nature of business demand means that marketers must be constantly alert to changes in consumer trends that ultimately will have an effect on business-to-business sales.**
* **INELASTIC DEMAND** The demand for business or organizatinoal product is generally inelastic. Inelastic demand means that, regardless of whether the price of a business-to-business product goes up or down, customers will buy the same quantity. (The notion of price elasticity in discussed further in Chapter 9). We see inelastic demand in business-to-business markets because an individual busienss product is usually one of the many parts and materials that go into producing the consuemr product. **It is not unusual for a large increase in price for a single business product to have little effect on the price of the final consumer product.** For example, the BMW sells for about $75,000. To produce the car, BMW purchases thousands of different parts. If the price of tires, batteries, or steros goes up--or down--BMW will still buy enough t o meet consumer demand for its cars. As you might imagine, increasing the price of a $75,000 car by $30 or $40 or even $1000 won't change consumer demand
* Business-to-business demand isn't always inelastic. Sometimmes producing a consuemr good or service relies on only one or a few materials or component parts. If the price of the part increases, demand may become elstic if the manufacturer of the consumer good passes the increase on to the consumer. Steel, for example, is a large component of automobiles. If the price of steel goes up, automobile manufacturers will pay a lot more for a necessary component of their product. An increase in the price of steel can drive up the price of automobiles so much that consumer demand for them drops, decreasing the demand for steel.
