# Preface

* The complexity of the decision faced by Canadian marketers in today's technology-intensive, hpyer competitive global business environment is both exciting and challenging.
* The main goal of this textbook is to help students develop the skills necessary to meet these challenges by immersing them in experience in marketing decision making.
* This textbook focuses on marketing decision making and the decision maker, not just on marketing theory, concepts, and principles.
* Student pratice making and supporting real marketing decisions and learn from decisions made by others--experienced and successful international marketers in a variety of industries, companies, and context.
* The text is more strategic in focus, introducing strategic marketing concepts such as the development of market-driven strategies, positioning strategies, and sources of sustainable competitive advantage. This allows students to fully apprecitate the strategic nature and implications of their decision
* At the same time, the text focuses on decision making by taking marketing managers' perspectives and showing students how core marketing concepts, theories, and principles are used to make key marketing decisions
* It contains an organizing framwork that illustrates how all of the decisions marketers make related to each other.
* Chapter 1 (what is marketing?) introduces an organizing framework that provides students with a summary of the **marketing planning** process. We have placed a greater focus on value creation through a more detailed discussion of value creation and by using value creation as a theme throughout the text 
* The discussion of SWOT analysis in Chapter 2 (Making **Strategic Marketing** Decisions) has been enhanced
* In Chapter 3 (**Market Segmentation and Positioning**), we have put greater focus on defending positioning strategies and on developing brand personality
* In Chapter 4 (**Market Research**), we have updated the section on marketing inteligence, including updated example. We have also provided a more comprehensive discussion of **customer satisfaction** measurement and expand the discussion of interactive and online **marketing research**
* In Chapter 5 (**Consumer Buying Behavior**), we have enhanced our discussion of **brand loyalty** and the **FCB grid**. We have updated our discussion of technology with a new section on blogs and **blogging** and RSS feeds
* In Chapter 6, (**Organizational Buying Behavior**), we have provided a new section on **Customer Relationship Management** and made our discussion of the use of technology in managing these relationship more current.
* In Chapter 7 (PRoduct Strategy), we have revised the discussion of the layers of the **product concept** to be consistent with the approach most instructors expect. A discussion of **product classifications** has been added to the chapter.
* In Chatper 8 (Product Management), we have added a new section on **service strategy**.
* In Chapter 9 (Pricing Strategy), we have streamlined the presentation of the material and made it easier to read by moving more of the marketing math concepts and examples to the Chapter Appendix
* In Chapter 10 (Channels and Supply Chain Strategy), we have enhanced our discussion of channel management with new section on **motivating channel partners**. 
* In Chapter 11 (**Retailing and E-tailing**), we have updated our discussion, facts, and figures relating to e-tailing and we have added a discussion of the marketing implications of social networking sites like Youtube, MySpace, and Facebook
* In Chapter 12 (**Integrated Marketing Communication**), we have added new sections discussing Characteristics of **IMC, Database Marketing, buzz marketing, guerilla marketing, event marketing, and viral marketing**.
* In Chatper 13 (**Commmunication Mix and Tactics**), we have expanded our discussion of **Internet advertising**, added a new section of **mobile marketing and SMS**, and added a new section on **Search Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization**. We have also added a discussion of technology to our treatment of **personal selling**
* In Chapter 14 (**Developing and Implementing a marketing Plan**), we have provided a much more detailed discussion of **marketing planning** and how to write a marketing plan. A new sample marketing plan that follows the prescribed marketing plan outline has been included in the appendix.

### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.

* [Def] Value refer to the benefit a customer receives from buying and using a good or service in relation to the costs and sacrifices of buying and using it
* You have "market value" as a person--you have qulities that set you apart from others and abilities other people want and need. After you finish this course, you'll have even more value because you'll know about the field of marketing and how the field relates to you as a future busienss person and a consumer. Although our main focus is understanding how to make effective marketing decisions for organizations, what you learn here equally applies to "brand you" -- and hopefully you will get some ideas about what you can do to increase your value to employers, partners, and maybe even to society. You probably already knew that celebrities like Sidney Crosby, Mike Meyers and Avril Lavigne are "brands"--but so is every one else. We "position" ourselves for job interviews; we are "on the market" when we break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend; some people hire image consultant to devise a "marketing strategy" for them; while others undergo plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their "product image". So, the principles of marketing apply to you, just as they apply to coffee, cars, computers, and produce. While there are some difference in how we go about marketing each of these, the basic ideas are the same. Marketing is a fundamental part of our lies both as consumers and as business people. 

##### THE WHO AND WHERE OF MARKETING
* This book is about marketing, and more specifically about making effective marketing decisions that create value for others. 
* Marketers come from many different places. Although many have earned marketing degrees, others have all sorts of background, sometimes with formal training and sometimes without. Fashion retailers may have training in design. Advertising creative executives often have a fine arts background while copywriters often have degrees in English. E-marketer who design interactive webpages for products and companies may have studies computer science. Even accountants often end up in marketing roles, as someone needs to make marketing decisions for accounting firms.
* Marketers work in a variety of location. They work in consumer goods companies such as Mega Bloks or Black & Decker or at service companies, or the Bank of Montreal. You will see them in retail organizatinos like lululemon atheletica or Frontrunners and at companies that manufacture products for other companies like Bombardier or Nortel. You will see them in government organizations like the Canadian Tourism Commission, not-for-profit organizations like the Candian Cancer Society, large organizations like IBM Canada, and small startup like TeamPage, a website for intramural and other amateur sport teams to coordinate and communicate their activities. Sport and the arts are hotbeds of activity for marketing. A big part of these efforts involves promoting athletes like Sidney Crosby and artist like Avril Lavigne--who themselves create customer experiences
* Marketing principles are organizations work hard to convince consumers to use seat belts, engage in safe sex, not litter, not smoke, and not drink and drive. 
* No matter where they work, all marketers are real people who make decisions that affect themselves, their companies, and very often thousands if not millions of consumers or customers
* It is important to recognize that the marketing decision maker may not have made the most appropriate decision. In fact, there are no "right answers" in business and, ultimately, consumers are the only judges of whether we, as marketers, have made good decisions. What you want to practice is making and defending your decision based on appropriate analysis, application of marketing theory, concepts, and principles, and your judgment. Do not worry if you think that you might not have good judgment yet. That comes with experience and practice in making marketing decision.
* [def] The official definition of marketing adopted in 2004 by the American Marketing Association is: **marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholder**. The basic idea of this somwhat complicated definition of marketing is that marketing is all about creating and delivering value, and doing this for all parties involved in an exchange. This involves a decision-making process, and these decisions are typically (but not always) made by people who have official marketing roles in areas of an organization such as marketing department, a sales department, a marketing communications department, or a new product development department. Another definition of marketing is: **marketing is the process of achieving individual and organizational objectives by creating superior customer value for one or more target market with a sustainable strategy.** This definition suggests that "the prime directive" of marketing is to achieve objectives. **We do that by creating superior customer value--creating offers that are perceived as being more valuable to customers than any other solutions (competing brands), or even more valuable than the money in their wallet**. [def] **Customer value** is what you get from buying and using a product relative to the costs and sacrifices you incur to do so. **To create a transaction or an economic exchange of value, both parties need to believe that the exchange is fair--that what they get is worth more to them than what they give up.** Of course each of us has our own perceptions of how to best satisfy our needs, what is valuable, and what exchanges are "worth it". One enterprising entrepreneur in England recently offered deluxe 61-step car washes for $10,000. Enough customers thought the two-week process was worth it thathe has nine months' worth of business lined up. **The challenge to the marketer is to create, price, distribute, and communicate an attrative value proposition to the customer to get the most value in return**. (EX: Pepsi-cola hopes that the product, price, distribution, and communication decisions it makes for Aquafina result in a value proposition preferred by customers). This alternative definition also focuses on the idea of creating value for specific target markets, groups of people that have different needs, wants, or preferences from other groups of people and would seek a different value proposition(solution). Not everyone would want a $10,000 car wash, but apprently some people (sheiks and billionaires) do. This definition also suggests that we want to **develop a sustainable strategy**, not in the environmental sense, but in the sense of making a set of decision that will allow us to compete effectively until our objectives have been achieved--which ofr most organizations is a long term perspective

### Marketing is About Creating Customer Value
* One important part of our definition of marketing is taht it is about creating value for **diverse stakeholders**. [def] the term stakeholders here refers to **buyers, sellers, investors in a company, community residents, and even citizens of the nations where goods and services are made or sold**. [MY]: different from stakeholder from project management, which is people who is affected or can influence the project.
* One important stakeholder is the consumer. A consumer is the ultimate user of a good or service. Consumers can be individuals or organizations (although we usually use the term "customer" when referring to an organization), whether a company, government, charity, or association. So while some like to say "the customer is king", it is important to recognize that **marketing is not just about satisfying customer needs, it is about satisfying the needs of all the parties involved in an exchange**. **The seller needs to make a profit to stay in busienss to be able to continue offering the goods and services valued by the customer**. Similarly, a not-for-profit organization needs to match its supply of resources with custommer demand. This is the philosophy behind the marketing concept. The marketing concept suggests **organizational objectives such as long-term profitability are best met by first understanding what customers need (value sought) and then determining the associated costs of satisfying those needs (creating and delivering that value)--thus creating exchanges of mutual satisfaction.** Central to the philosophy reflected in the marketing concept is **an understanding that organizations exist to create value for consumers where it is neither efficient nor effective for consumers to attempt to satisfy their needs themselves.
* [def] **a need is the difference between a consumer's actual state and some ideal or desired state.** When the difference is big enough, the consumer is motivated to take action to satisfy the need. When you are hungry, you buy a snack. If you're not happy with your hair, you get a new look. **Needs are related to phsical conditions, such as being cold, hungry, or scared, and psychological conditions such as being liked, commmunicating with others, or being fulfilled**. The specific way a need is satisfied depends on an individual's history, learning experiences, and cultural environment. [def] **a want is a desire for a particular product used to satisfy a need in specific ways that are cultural and socially influenced** for example, two classmates' stomatchs runble during  a noon-hour class, and both need food. How each of them satisfies this need may be quite different. One might crave a salad or a bag of trail mix to go. The other might buy a cheeseburger and fries. On the want may be even more specific. I want Mountain Country Yogurt Trail Mix or a McDonald's cheeseburger. **Consumers are motivated by needs, but make purchase decisions based on wants.**
* **A product delivers a benefit when it satisfies a need or want.** **For marketers to be successful, they must develop products that provide one or more benefits**. **The challenge is to identify what benefits people look for, develop a product that delivers those benefits, and then convince buyers that it does so better than a competitor's product**. **As the management expert Peter Drucker worte, "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous**. **What Drucker means is if we succeed in creating a product that meets the needs of the customer, he or she will happily buy it without any "persuasion" from a salesperson. The salesperson may still be required to make the customer aware of the product and its relative merits in them--and typically less about the particular features or funcitons that deliver those benefits.** You buy a cordless drill because you care about the ease of making holes (the benefit). You may buy a particular brand of cordless drill because of differences in particular features that enable some drills to deliver the core benefit better than others.
* Everyone can want your product, but they doesn't ensure sales unless they have the means to obtain it. When you couple desire with the buying power or resources to satisfy a want, the result is **demand**. So, the potential customers for a snappy, red BMW convertible are the people who want the car minus those who can't afford to buy or lease one. **A market consists of all the consumers who share a common need that can be satisfied by a product purchase and who have the resources, willingness, and authority to make the purchase**.
* A marketplace used to be a locatino where buying and selling occurred face to face. The marketplace may still be a street corner or an open air market, but in today's "wired" world, buyers and sellers might not ever see each other. Increasingly the modern marketplace takes the form of a **glitzy shopping mall, a mail-order catalogue, a television shopping network, a eBay auction site, or an e-commerce website**.

### Marketing is About Exchange Relationships
* **At the heart of every marketing act--big or small--is something we refer to as an "exchange relationship"**. An exchange occurs when something is obtained for something else in return. **The buyer receives an object, service, or idea that satisfies a need and the seller receives something he or she believes is of equivalent economic value.** Usually this is money, but it could be other goods or services. Almost anything of value can be exchanged--including, **your time, your ideas, and the thing you can do**. Politicians exchange **promises for votes**, athletes and performers **exchange performances for ticket sales and exchange their images via endorsements in exchange for product sales**. Places like Canada's Wonderland or Prince Edward Island **exchange experiences for customers' time and money**. Not-for-profit organizations like Covenant House exchange **services for the time of their clients and exchange the concept of making a difference to the problem of homelessness for the money of their donators**. **For an exchange to occur, at least two people or organizations must be willing to make a trade, and each must have sommething the other wants. Both parties must agree on the value of the exchange and how it will be carried out. Each party also must be free to accept or reject the other's terms for the exchange.** Under these conditions, a gun-wielding rober's offer to "exchange" your money for your life does not constitute a valid economic exchange. 

### Marketing As a Decision-making Process
The American Marketing Association definition of marketing suggests that **marketing is primarily a decision-making process that allows individuals and organizations to achieve objectives by creating value that satisfies stakeholder needs and wants.** As such, marketing decision making involves a series of steps that entail both careful thought (planning) and action(executing). When it's done right, marketing is a strategic decision-making process in which marketing managers determine the most appropriate set of decision for a particular organization at a particular time that will help the organization meet its long term objective

##### Understand the Opportunity
* **Marketing decisions start with understanding the situation, or context, in which the decision need to be made.** **Situational analysis** involves identifying opportunities to create value for the organization by creating value for customers. First, it involes understanding factors relating to **the markets in which an organization competes**, such as **understanding general trends in that market, consumer or organizational buying behavior, industry dynamics, and the strategies and likely reactions of competitors**. The marketing decision makers need to assess factors relating to **their own organization and their ability to create value and compete effectively in those markets**. These internal factors include **understanding the relative effectiveness of their current marketing strategy, their resources, competencies, and expertise, and the values or mission of the organization**.

##### Specify the Value: Market Strategy
* Marketer make marketing strategy decisions to achieve the objectives of their organization, which usually include both **financial objectives (such as a particular profit target)** and **marketing objectives (such as sales targets or market share targets)**. **Once the marketing and other objectives are developed, the organization develops a marketing strategy aimed at achieving those objectives**.
* The **most critical** decision marketers make in developing marketing strategy is **the selection of the specific group of customers** on which they will focus their customer value creation efforts. [def] A market segment is **a distinct group of customers within a large market who have similar needs, wants, preferences, and behaviors, who seek similar product solution, and whose needs differ from other customers in the larger market**. Parents with young children, for example, typically seek different entertainment products than teenagers and young adults.
* [def] Market segmentation is **the process of dividing the overall market into groups of consumers who are sufficiently similar within the group to want a similar value offer and different enough from other groups to want a different value offer than those other groups**. The challenge is to identify groups with real differences in underlying needs, wants, preferences, behaivors, and opinions about value. Consequently, detailed segment profiles of each group msut be developed that specify these differences and other characteristics of the group that will help marketers design and present a valued offer.  For example, one way the Levi Strauss lices up the market is in terms of age segments--this makes sense, since different age group have different purposes. **Business-to-busienss markets** are someimtes divided into segments using characteristics such as type of business, decision-making criteria, size, or sales volume, if these characteristics reflect differences in the needs, wants, or behaivours of organizations.
* Marketers weigh each of the segments in terms of **profitability potential against a number of factors**, including **the organization's ability to create value and satisfy the needs of the segments**, **their goals and resources, and their ability to compete effectively against other offering**. On the basis of this analysis, the organization decides whether it will focus on a single segment or on several segments. The chosen market(s) become the organization's target market(s) toward which it directs its marketing efforts. For example, Hewitt is an outsourcing cojmpany that has decided to focus exclusively on the needs of the human resources professional. As the ad for Hewitt illustrates, it offers tailored solutino in HR areas such as talent, benefits, payroll, health care, retirement.
* Because different target markets have different and sometimes conflicting needs, wants, and preferences, marketers typically have to choose among alternative segments on which to focus. This is one of Richard Hill's dilemmas at Yellow Point Lodge--how to attract new consumers without turning off long-loyal consumers at the same time. Similarly, Canadian fashion designer Linda Lundstrom (and her company, Linda Lundstrom Ltd) doesn't make clothes for everyone. First, she designs clothes only for women. Lundstrom further narrows her market by focusing on the needs of women with less than perfect figures. She also gears her line toward working women who need clothes that can wear and travel well. Her most successful item is an extremely warm winter coat that combines comfort and function with a style based on First Nations artist Norval Morrisseau's traditional patterns.
* Some firms choose to reach as many customers as possible by offering their products to a mass market, which consists of all possible customers in a market, regardless of the difference in their specific needs and wants. This strategy, however, is not tenable in the long run. Usually competitors of mass markets, or even the mass marketers themselves, bring alternative products to market that have greater appeal to a subset of the people in the mass market, eroding the market share of the mass market product
* Many companies know that they must look for potential target markets beyond their own geographical borders to compete in today's world economy. Modern marketers are busy meeting the needs of people all around the world, especially when the demand for products at home flattens. Expanding internationally is desirable,, for example, to the Mattel Corporation (www.mattel.com). The average North American girl owns eight barbies, making it the best-selling toy ever. The domestic market is starting to become saturated, so Mattel is diversifying to offset the company's reliance on North American Barbie sales. Europe has nearly twice as many children as North America; and numbers in Mexico, South America, Japan, and Southeast Asia are even greater. Mattel now manufactures 75 percent of its toys in plants around the world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Mexico, and Italy
* **Positioning** After choosing the target market(s), marketers need to develop an offering that appeals to the needs, wants, and prefernces of the target market better than alternatives provided by competitors. This process starts with positioning the product. **Positioning** involves developing a marketing strategy to differentiate an offering from others in the marketplace in the mind of the target customers. It establishes how the marketing organization wants its brand to be known--what value it offers relative to competitors and why that offer is superior to others for a particular target market. Positioning also involves developing strategy to defend the image that has or will be created and specifying the unique competencies, resources, and know-how that allows a firm to sustain its superiority. The positioning of a brand often involves developing a brand personality. For example, VOSS Water (www.vosswater.com) has developed a personality of sophistication. Its water comes from a "virgin aquifer that has been shielded for centuries under ice and rock in the untouched wilderness of Central Norway". At prices ranging up to $22.00 for a 0.5L bottle, customers are putting a significant premium on that personality!

#### Create the Value: Marketing Mix Decisions
Once t he desired positioning is established, marketers need to create the value proposition reflected in the offer. To do this, marketers make a set of decisions about the product itself, its price, the place it is available for purchase, and the activities that introduce it to consumers. These decisions, collectively called the marketing mix decisions, create the value promised by the product positioning and are intended to be sufficiently motivating (valuable) to create a desired exchange response among members of the target market. Just as every college student seems to have an iPod, every government official seems to have a BlackBerry. The marketing mix decisions made by Apple and RIM created a value proposition so motivating that they have had trouble keeping up with demand.
* The marketing mix decisions are commonly known as the four Ps. **product, price, promotion(communication), and place(distribution). Together, the bundle of marketing mix elements represents an offer of value to the consumer: What the consumer will receive in an exchange. Sometimes marketers consider a fifth P, "people" or relationship. Others, including the authors of this book, view managing exchange relationship as being so central to what marketers do that it should be integrated into all the other marketing decisions and not treated as a separate decision.
* Just as a radio DJ puts together a collection of separate songs ( amusical mix) to create a certain mood, the idea of a mix in this context reminds us that no single marketing activity is sufficient to accomplish the organization's objectives, and that consistency among the decisions is critical to the overall marketing program.

###### Product
* **The product is a good, service, idea, place, person**--whatever is offered for exchange. Notice, therefore, that the concept of product as defined in marketing is broader than its usage in everyday language, where it primarily signifies a tangible good. Product strategy decisions begin with objectives: What do you want to achieve with your product decision? For example, Proctor & Gamble (P&G) wanted to expand its market share internationally but found that many consumers could not afford its traditional brands. This prompted P&G to develop new products, such as Pampers Uni diapers, that are tailored to meet the needs of international customers, such as those in Brazil, but have a significantly lower cost structure. Then you need to specify the product concept. What is the core value (benefit) you are offering, and how do you deliver that value through the features, functions, design, and other attributes of the product? Marketers also make product line decisions about how many variants or versions (models, types, sizes, colors, shapes, flavors) of a product they will offer. Honda, for example, chooses to compete with just a few models of cars, while General Moters has more than 100. Service strategy decisions also need to be made. Disneyland or Walt Disney World, the strategy to create the desired customer experience is central to what they do, but even packaged goods like cereal or consumer goods like a notebook computer can have important service aspects. Dell, for example, offers free delivery, online and phone-based technical support, and a range of options for getting your computer fixed if there is a problem, including in-home repair. Product decisions also include **branding strategy**: Will a product be part of a family of product like Cambell's soups, an individual brand like BlackBerry, a store brand like President's Choice, or just be named for the product category, like "Spaghetti"? Finally, **product decisions include packaging and labelling decisions. Be honest, how many times have you bought something because the package looked good?**

###### Price
* The price is the seller's assessment of the value of a product; what they would liketo receive from the buyer in exchange for the product. Pricing strategy decisions start with pricing objectives: What do you want to accomplish with your pricing decisions? Are you trying to support a premium position like Gucci, a competitive position like Zellers or Wal-Mart(lower prices), or you trying to increase market share, like Procter & Gamble in Brail? **Different pricing objectives suggest different pricing policies.** P & G used to determine its prices based on what a product actually cost to develop plus a profit, but now it prices products by what consumers in different countries can afford. Walmart uses Every Day Low Prices as a policy. Marketers also have to ome up with the actual price. Price point decisions need to take into consideration the cost of creating and delivering the product, competitors' prices, and what the customer is willing to pay, among other factors. There are also psychological consideraitons. Should the price of Croc shoes be $39.99 or $37.54, or $40.00? Finally, marketers need to decide or pricing terms and conditions: When does the price need to be paid, how can it be paid, are there any special deals or discounts?

###### Distribution
Place concerns the availability of the product to the customer at the desired time and locatino. Channels of distribution involve firms that work together to get a product from a producer to a consumer. For consumer goods like Root clothing products, a distribution channel includes retailer suchas Sears as well as their own Root retail outlets and the Root website. **Distribution decisions begin with specifying the distribution objectives: Are you trying to make the product as widely available as possible, minimize the cost of getting the product to the customer, or make it easy for customers to compare your product with others--such as with an Auto Mall?** To achieve one or another of these distribution objectives, marketers decide on a distribution system: **What type of distribution system will be created, how many traditional approach or non-traditional one?** Channel relationship management decisions also need to be made: How will you identify, attract, motivate, and keep your channel partners working toward your common goals and how will you deal with the conflict that is inherent between the roles of channel members? Finally, supply chain management involves systems and process to ensure efficient and effective value creation, from the sourcing of raw materials to the customer receiving the value. The include logistics, the physical distribution of goods to the customer, or a service blueprint for delivering a service experience.

###### Communication
Promotion refers to **the marketing commmunication activities undertaken to inform consumers or organizations about goods, services, or ideas, and to encourage potential customers to buy these goods, services, or ideas**. Unlike the other marketing mix decisions, **communication strategy decisions start with deciding the audience, or target of the commmunication, not the commmunication objective**. The audience is a specific subset of a target market whose members are the receives of the communication. **A communication campaign usually has many different elements targeted at different audiences, but we design the strategy for each audience.** For each audience we need to decide the commmunication objectives: **What do you want to achieve with your communication decisions? is the objective to create awareness about your product, develop purchase intentions, encourage trial of the product, or develop trust with your customers** To achieve these or other communications objectives, **marketers need to decide on an overall approach to the communication strategy: Will it be a push strategy where retailers are encouraged to stock products that customers can find or a pull strategy where customers are encouraged to seek products from retailers or other channel members?** Will it be one-way communication or will you seek feedback from customers and try to develop a relationship with them? Once the overall approach is decided, we need to decide the key messages; what we want to communicate to our audience; and the tactics we will use to get their attention. Then we decide on the appropriate communications mix to get our message(s) to our audience: Should we develop advertising for television, radio, or print pulications; create promotions like Tim Hortons' Roll Up the Rim to Win contest; use public relations as Raincoast Books used to gain free publicity around Harry Potter book launches; communicate using a sales force; create a website; or use viral marketing techniques such as developing entertaining video clips that customers can sendtheir friends? We also need to decide on a creative strategy that will get the attention of our audience, schedule the timing and placement of any advertising that is used, determine a budget to do all this, and develop a way to evaluate whether our communication strategy has been effective.
* For example, Mike's Hard Lemonade Company's communication strategy supports the brand image by developing and supporting the "personalities" of Mike and the lemonade. Cute stories about Mike and lemons were included on the packaging, and the product was brought to consumers' attention with print advertising, in-store displays, and on-shelf signage. After Mike's initial success, television advertising was created that showed "lemon being hurt real bad in the making of this product" and investigators trying to determine "who has been hurting the lemons". These quirky, light-hearted ads helped make Mike's the leading brand in the Canadian cooler market. There is also a hip Internet site (www.mikeshardlemonade.com) that further supports the brand's personality.


Because of all these, there are lots of decisions that marketers make for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Once made these decision need to be acted upon
