### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.

* [Def] Value refer to the benefit a customer receives from buying and using a good or service in relation to the costs and sacrifices of buying and using it
* You have "market value" as a person--you have qulities that set you apart from others and abilities other people want and need. After you finish this course, you'll have even more value because you'll know about the field of marketing and how the field relates to you as a future busienss person and a consumer. Although our main focus is understanding how to make effective marketing decisions for organizations, what you learn here equally applies to "brand you" -- and hopefully you will get some ideas about what you can do to increase your value to employers, partners, and maybe even to society. You probably already knew that celebrities like Sidney Crosby, Mike Meyers and Avril Lavigne are "brands"--but so is every one else. We "position" ourselves for job interviews; we are "on the market" when we break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend; some people hire image consultant to devise a "marketing strategy" for them; while others undergo plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their "product image". So, the principles of marketing apply to you, just as they apply to coffee, cars, computers, and produce. While there are some difference in how we go about marketing each of these, the basic ideas are the same. Marketing is a fundamental part of our lies both as consumers and as business people. 

##### THE WHO AND WHERE OF MARKETING
* This book is about marketing, and more specifically about making effective marketing decisions that create value for others. 
* Marketers come from many different places. Although many have earned marketing degrees, others have all sorts of background, sometimes with formal training and sometimes without. Fashion retailers may have training in design. Advertising creative executives often have a fine arts background while copywriters often have degrees in English. E-marketer who design interactive webpages for products and companies may have studies computer science. Even accountants often end up in marketing roles, as someone needs to make marketing decisions for accounting firms.
* Marketers work in a variety of location. They work in consumer goods companies such as Mega Bloks or Black & Decker or at service companies, or the Bank of Montreal. You will see them in retail organizatinos like lululemon atheletica or Frontrunners and at companies that manufacture products for other companies like Bombardier or Nortel. You will see them in government organizations like the Canadian Tourism Commission, not-for-profit organizations like the Candian Cancer Society, large organizations like IBM Canada, and small startup like TeamPage, a website for intramural and other amateur sport teams to coordinate and communicate their activities. Sport and the arts are hotbeds of activity for marketing. A big part of these efforts involves promoting athletes like Sidney Crosby and artist like Avril Lavigne--who themselves create customer experiences
* Marketing principles are organizations work hard to convince consumers to use seat belts, engage in safe sex, not litter, not smoke, and not drink and drive. 
* No matter where they work, all marketers are real people who make decisions that affect themselves, their companies, and very often thousands if not millions of consumers or customers
* It is important to recognize that the marketing decision maker may not have made the most appropriate decision. In fact, there are no "right answers" in business and, ultimately, consumers are the only judges of whether we, as marketers, have made good decisions. What you want to practice is making and defending your decision based on appropriate analysis, application of marketing theory, concepts, and principles, and your judgment. Do not worry if you think that you might not have good judgment yet. That comes with experience and practice in making marketing decision.
* [def] The official definition of marketing adopted in 2004 by the American Marketing Association is: **marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholder**. The basic idea of this somwhat complicated definition of marketing is that marketing is all about creating and delivering value, and doing this for all parties involved in an exchange. This involves a decision-making process, and these decisions are typically (but not always) made by people who have official marketing roles in areas of an organization such as marketing department, a sales department, a marketing communications department, or a new product development department. Another definition of marketing is: **marketing is the process of achieving individual and organizational objectives by creating superior customer value for one or more target market with a sustainable strategy.** This definition suggests that "the prime directive" of marketing is to achieve objectives. **We do that by creating superior customer value--creating offers that are perceived as being more valuable to customers than any other solutions (competing brands), or even more valuable than the money in their wallet**. [def] **Customer value** is what you get from buying and using a product relative to the costs and sacrifices you incur to do so. **To create a transaction or an economic exchange of value, both parties need to believe that the exchange is fair--that what they get is worth more to them than what they give up.** Of course each of us has our own perceptions of how to best satisfy our needs, what is valuable, and what exchanges are "worth it". One enterprising entrepreneur in England recently offered deluxe 61-step car washes for $10,000. Enough customers thought the two-week process was worth it thathe has nine months' worth of business lined up. **The challenge to the marketer is to create, price, distribute, and communicate an attrative value proposition to the customer to get the most value in return**. (EX: Pepsi-cola hopes that the product, price, distribution, and communication decisions it makes for Aquafina result in a value proposition preferred by customers). This alternative definition also focuses on the idea of creating value for specific target markets, groups of people that have different needs, wants, or preferences from other groups of people and would seek a different value proposition(solution). Not everyone would want a $10,000 car wash, but apprently some people (sheiks and billionaires) do. This definition also suggests that we want to **develop a sustainable strategy**, not in the environmental sense, but in the sense of making a set of decision that will allow us to compete effectively until our objectives have been achieved--which ofr most organizations is a long term perspective

### Marketing is About Creating Customer Value
* One important part of our definition of marketing is taht it is about creating value for **diverse stakeholders**. [def] the term stakeholders here refers to **buyers, sellers, investors in a company, community residents, and even citizens of the nations where goods and services are made or sold**. [MY]: different from stakeholder from project management, which is people who is affected or can influence the project.
* One important stakeholder is the consumer. A consumer is the ultimate user of a good or service. Consumers can be individuals or organizations (although we usually use the term "customer" when referring to an organization), whether a company, government, charity, or association. So while some like to say "the customer is king", it is important to recognize that **marketing is not just about satisfying customer needs, it is about satisfying the needs of all the parties involved in an exchange**. **The seller needs to make a profit to stay in busienss to be able to continue offering the goods and services valued by the customer**. Similarly, a not-for-profit organization needs to match its supply of resources with custommer demand. This is the philosophy behind the marketing concept. The marketing concept suggests **organizational objectives such as long-term profitability are best met by first understanding what customers need (value sought) and then determining the associated costs of satisfying those needs (creating and delivering that value)--thus creating exchanges of mutual satisfaction.** Central to the philosophy reflected in the marketing concept is **an understanding that organizations exist to create value for consumers where it is neither efficient nor effective for consumers to attempt to satisfy their needs themselves.
* [def] **a need is the difference between a consumer's actual state and some ideal or desired state.** When the difference is big enough, the consumer is motivated to take action to satisfy the need. When you are hungry, you buy a snack. If you're not happy with your hair, you get a new look. **Needs are related to phsical conditions, such as being cold, hungry, or scared, and psychological conditions such as being liked, commmunicating with others, or being fulfilled**. The specific way a need is satisfied depends on an individual's history, learning experiences, and cultural environment. [def] **a want is a desire for a particular product used to satisfy a need in specific ways that are cultural and socially influenced** for example, two classmates' stomatchs runble during  a noon-hour class, and both need food. How each of them satisfies this need may be quite different. One might crave a salad or a bag of trail mix to go. The other might buy a cheeseburger and fries. On the want may be even more specific. I want Mountain Country Yogurt Trail Mix or a McDonald's cheeseburger. **Consumers are motivated by needs, but make purchase decisions based on wants.**
* **A product delivers a benefit when it satisfies a need or want.** **For marketers to be successful, they must develop products that provide one or more benefits**. **The challenge is to identify what benefits people look for, develop a product that delivers those benefits, and then convince buyers that it does so better than a competitor's product**. **As the management expert Peter Drucker worte, "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous**. **What Drucker means is if we succeed in creating a product that meets the needs of the customer, he or she will happily buy it without any "persuasion" from a salesperson. The salesperson may still be required to make the customer aware of the product and its relative merits in them--and typically less about the particular features or funcitons that deliver those benefits.** You buy a cordless drill because you care about the ease of making holes (the benefit). You may buy a particular brand of cordless drill because of differences in particular features that enable some drills to deliver the core benefit better than others.
* Everyone can want your product, but they doesn't ensure sales unless they have the means to obtain it. When you couple desire with the buying power or resources to satisfy a want, the result is **demand**. So, the potential customers for a snappy, red BMW convertible are the people who want the car minus those who can't afford to buy or lease one. **A market consists of all the consumers who share a common need that can be satisfied by a product purchase and who have the resources, willingness, and authority to make the purchase**.
* A marketplace used to be a locatino where buying and selling occurred face to face. The marketplace may still be a street corner or an open air market, but in today's "wired" world, buyers and sellers might not ever see each other. Increasingly the modern marketplace takes the form of a **glitzy shopping mall, a mail-order catalogue, a television shopping network, a eBay auction site, or an e-commerce website**.

### Marketing is About Exchange Relationships
* **At the heart of every marketing act--big or small--is something we refer to as an "exchange relationship"**. An exchange occurs when something is obtained for something else in return. **The buyer receives an object, service, or idea that satisfies a need and the seller receives something he or she believes is of equivalent economic value.** Usually this is money, but it could be other goods or services. Almost anything of value can be exchanged--including, **your time, your ideas, and the thing you can do**. Politicians exchange **promises for votes**, athletes and performers **exchange performances for ticket sales and exchange their images via endorsements in exchange for product sales**. Places like Canada's Wonderland or Prince Edward Island **exchange experiences for customers' time and money**. Not-for-profit organizations like Covenant House exchange **services for the time of their clients and exchange the concept of making a difference to the problem of homelessness for the money of their donators**. **For an exchange to occur, at least two people or organizations must be willing to make a trade, and each must have sommething the other wants. Both parties must agree on the value of the exchange and how it will be carried out. Each party also must be free to accept or reject the other's terms for the exchange.** Under these conditions, a gun-wielding rober's offer to "exchange" your money for your life does not constitute a valid economic exchange. 

### Marketing As a Decision-making Process
The American Marketing Association definition of marketing suggests that **marketing is primarily a decision-making process that allows individuals and organizations to achieve objectives by creating value that satisfies stakeholder needs and wants.** As such, marketing decision making involves a series of steps that entail both careful thought (planning) and action(executing). When it's done right, marketing is a strategic decision-making process in which marketing managers determine the most appropriate set of decision for a particular organization at a particular time that will help the organization meet its long term objective

        Understand the Opportunity--> Market Strategy: Specify the Value-->Marketing Mix: Create the Value--> Implementation & Evaluation: Realize the Value

##### Understand the Opportunity
* **Marketing decisions start with understanding the situation, or context, in which the decision need to be made.** **Situational analysis** involves identifying opportunities to create value for the organization by creating value for customers. First, it involes understanding factors relating to **the markets in which an organization competes**, such as understanding general trends in that market, consumer or organizational buying
