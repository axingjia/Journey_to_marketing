### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.
