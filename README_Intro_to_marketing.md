### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.

* [Def] Value refer to the benefit a customer receives from buying and using a good or service in relation to the costs and sacrifices of buying and using it
* You have "market value" as a person--you have qulities that set you apart from others and abilities other people want and need. After you finish this course, you'll have even more value because you'll know about the field of marketing and how the field relates to you as a future busienss person and a consumer. Although our main focus is understanding how to make effective marketing decisions for organizations, what you learn here equally applies to "brand you" -- and hopefully you will get some ideas about what you can do to increase your value to employers, partners, and maybe even to society. You probably already knew that celebrities like Sidney Crosby, Mike Meyers and Avril Lavigne are "brands"--but so is every one else. We "position" ourselves for job interviews; we are "on the market" when we break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend; some people hire image consultant to devise a "marketing strategy" for them; while others undergo plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their "product image". So, the principles of marketing apply to you, just as they apply to coffee, cars, computers, and produce. While there are some difference in how we go about marketing each of these, the basic ideas are the same. Marketing is a fundamental part of our lies both as consumers and as business people. 

##### THE WHO AND WHERE OF MARKETING
* This book is about marketing, and more specifically about making effective marketing decisions that create value for others. 
* Marketers come from many different places. Although many have earned marketing degrees, others have all sorts of background, sometimes with formal training and sometimes without. Fashion retailers may have training in design. Advertising creative executives often have a fine arts background while copywriters often have degrees in English. E-marketer who design interactive webpages for products and companies may have studies computer science. Even accountants often end up in marketing roles, as someone needs to make marketing decisions for accounting firms.
* Marketers work in a variety of location. They work in consumer goods companies such as Mega Bloks or Black & Decker or at service companies, or the Bank of Montreal. You will see them in retail organizatinos like lululemon atheletica or Frontrunners and at companies that manufacture products for other companies like Bombardier or Nortel. You will see them in government organizations like the Canadian Tourism Commission, not-for-profit organizations like the Candian Cancer Society, large organizations like IBM Canada, and small startup like TeamPage, a website for intramural and other amateur sport teams to coordinate and communicate their activities. Sport and the arts are hotbeds of activity for marketing. A big part of these efforts involves promoting athletes like Sidney Crosby and artist like Avril Lavigne--who themselves create customer experiences
* Marketing principles are organizations work hard to convince consumers to use seat belts, engage in safe sex, not litter, not smoke, and not drink and drive. 
* No matter where they work, all marketers are real people who make decisions that affect themselves, their companies, and very often thousands if not millions of consumers or customers
* It is important to recognize that the marketing decision maker may not have made the most appropriate decision. In fact, there are no "right answers" in business and, ultimately, consumers are the only judges of whether we, as marketers, have made good decisions. What you want to practice is making and defending your decision based on appropriate analysis, application of marketing theory, concepts, and principles, and your judgment. Do not worry if you think that you might not have good judgment yet. That comes with experience and practice in making marketing decision.
* [def] The official definition of marketing adopted in 2004 by the American Marketing Association is: **marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholder**
