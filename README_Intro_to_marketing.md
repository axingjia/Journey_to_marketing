# Preface

* The complexity of the decision faced by Canadian marketers in today's technology-intensive, hpyer competitive global business environment is both exciting and challenging.
* The main goal of this textbook is to help students develop the skills necessary to meet these challenges by immersing them in experience in marketing decision making.
* This textbook focuses on marketing decision making and the decision maker, not just on marketing theory, concepts, and principles.
* Student pratice making and supporting real marketing decisions and learn from decisions made by others--experienced and successful international marketers in a variety of industries, companies, and context.
* The text is more strategic in focus, introducing strategic marketing concepts such as the development of market-driven strategies, positioning strategies, and sources of sustainable competitive advantage. This allows students to fully apprecitate the strategic nature and implications of their decision
* At the same time, the text focuses on decision making by taking marketing managers' perspectives and showing students how core marketing concepts, theories, and principles are used to make key marketing decisions
* It contains an organizing framwork that illustrates how all of the decisions marketers make related to each other.
* Chapter 1 (what is marketing?) introduces an organizing framework that provides students with a summary of the **marketing planning** process. We have placed a greater focus on value creation through a more detailed discussion of value creation and by using value creation as a theme throughout the text 
* The discussion of SWOT analysis in Chapter 2 (Making **Strategic Marketing** Decisions) has been enhanced
* In Chapter 3 (**Market Segmentation and Positioning**), we have put greater focus on defending positioning strategies and on developing brand personality
* In Chapter 4 (**Market Research**), we have updated the section on marketing inteligence, including updated example. We have also provided a more comprehensive discussion of **customer satisfaction** measurement and expand the discussion of interactive and online **marketing research**
* In Chapter 5 (**Consumer Buying Behavior**), we have enhanced our discussion of **brand loyalty** and the **FCB grid**. We have updated our discussion of technology with a new section on blogs and **blogging** and RSS feeds
* In Chapter 6, (**Organizational Buying Behavior**), we have provided a new section on **Customer Relationship Management** and made our discussion of the use of technology in managing these relationship more current.
* In Chapter 7 (PRoduct Strategy), we have revised the discussion of the layers of the **product concept** to be consistent with the approach most instructors expect. A discussion of **product classifications** has been added to the chapter.
* In Chatper 8 (Product Management), we have added a new section on **service strategy**.
* In Chapter 9 (Pricing Strategy), we have streamlined the presentation of the material and made it easier to read by moving more of the marketing math concepts and examples to the Chapter Appendix
* In Chapter 10 (Channels and Supply Chain Strategy), we have enhanced our discussion of channel management with new section on **motivating channel partners**. 
* In Chapter 11 (**Retailing and E-tailing**), we have updated our discussion, facts, and figures relating to e-tailing and we have added a discussion of the marketing implications of social networking sites like Youtube, MySpace, and Facebook
* In Chapter 12 (**Integrated Marketing Communication**), we have added new sections discussing Characteristics of **IMC, Database Marketing, buzz marketing, guerilla marketing, event marketing, and viral marketing**.
* In Chatper 13 (**Commmunication Mix and Tactics**), we have expanded our discussion of **Internet advertising**, added a new section of **mobile marketing and SMS**, and added a new section on **Search Engine Marketing and Search Engine Optimization**. We have also added a discussion of technology to our treatment of **personal selling**
* In Chapter 14 (**Developing and Implementing a marketing Plan**), we have provided a much more detailed discussion of **marketing planning** and how to write a marketing plan. A new sample marketing plan that follows the prescribed marketing plan outline has been included in the appendix.

### Approach and Organization
* Part 1 (Identifying and Specifying Value Opportunities) provides an overview of the world marketing (Chapter 1) and strategic marketing decision, and it introduces students to the key concepts of market segmentation and positioning (Chapter 3). These chapters help students understand the situational context, identify creative segmentation schemes, develop rich segment profiles, and evaluate the appropriateness of alternative **targeting strategies**.
* Part 2 (Understand Customer Value Needs and Behavior) provides **students with foundational tools and concepts for understanding the decision context**, **conducting industry and competitive analysis, and understanding customers**. This section includes discussion of marketing research (Chapter 4), consumer buying behavior (Chapter 5), and organizational buying behavior (Chapter 6)
* Part 3 (Creating the Value Proposition) provides students with the tools and concepts relating to **product strategies** (Chapter 7), **product management** (Chapter 8), **pricing strategy** (Chapter 9). These chapters focus on tailoring product and pricing decisions to suite the target market profile and strategic context
* Part 4 (Delivering, Communicating, and Implementing the Value) introduces students to channels and supply chain strategy (Chapter 10), retailing and e-tailing, integrated marketing commmunications, commmunications mix and tactics, and developing and implementing a marketing plan.
* Each chapter starts with a profile of a marketing decision maker who works in a position students might expectto have within a few years after graduation. A decision that the marketer has recently faced is described , and alternative courses of action are proposed. At this point, students are asked to step into the shoes of the profiled marketer, evaluate the alternatives, and recommend and defend a course of action. At the end of the chapter, we discuss what decision the marketer made and why, and provide a summary of the known consequences of that decision. We try to make it clear that the decision made by the marketer is not necessarrily the most appropriate one. Our aim is to show the rationale underpinning the decision and to help students understand how the rationale is informed by the decision maker's perspective. This format allows students to take an active role in applying the marketing concepts they are learning. We have included decision makers from a variety of organizations, ranging from large, well-known companies like Molson and IMB, to smaller regional businesses like CoastTire, to small family businesses like Yellow Point Lodge. This allows students to see how marketing issues and decisions differ across organizations, and also how they are similar.

* [Def] Value refer to the benefit a customer receives from buying and using a good or service in relation to the costs and sacrifices of buying and using it
* You have "market value" as a person--you have qulities that set you apart from others and abilities other people want and need. After you finish this course, you'll have even more value because you'll know about the field of marketing and how the field relates to you as a future busienss person and a consumer. Although our main focus is understanding how to make effective marketing decisions for organizations, what you learn here equally applies to "brand you" -- and hopefully you will get some ideas about what you can do to increase your value to employers, partners, and maybe even to society. You probably already knew that celebrities like Sidney Crosby, Mike Meyers and Avril Lavigne are "brands"--but so is every one else. We "position" ourselves for job interviews; we are "on the market" when we break up with a boyfriend or girlfriend; some people hire image consultant to devise a "marketing strategy" for them; while others undergo plastic surgery or makeovers to improve their "product image". So, the principles of marketing apply to you, just as they apply to coffee, cars, computers, and produce. While there are some difference in how we go about marketing each of these, the basic ideas are the same. Marketing is a fundamental part of our lies both as consumers and as business people. 

##### THE WHO AND WHERE OF MARKETING
* This book is about marketing, and more specifically about making effective marketing decisions that create value for others. 
* Marketers come from many different places. Although many have earned marketing degrees, others have all sorts of background, sometimes with formal training and sometimes without. Fashion retailers may have training in design. Advertising creative executives often have a fine arts background while copywriters often have degrees in English. E-marketer who design interactive webpages for products and companies may have studies computer science. Even accountants often end up in marketing roles, as someone needs to make marketing decisions for accounting firms.
* Marketers work in a variety of location. They work in consumer goods companies such as Mega Bloks or Black & Decker or at service companies, or the Bank of Montreal. You will see them in retail organizatinos like lululemon atheletica or Frontrunners and at companies that manufacture products for other companies like Bombardier or Nortel. You will see them in government organizations like the Canadian Tourism Commission, not-for-profit organizations like the Candian Cancer Society, large organizations like IBM Canada, and small startup like TeamPage, a website for intramural and other amateur sport teams to coordinate and communicate their activities. Sport and the arts are hotbeds of activity for marketing. A big part of these efforts involves promoting athletes like Sidney Crosby and artist like Avril Lavigne--who themselves create customer experiences
* Marketing principles are organizations work hard to convince consumers to use seat belts, engage in safe sex, not litter, not smoke, and not drink and drive. 
* No matter where they work, all marketers are real people who make decisions that affect themselves, their companies, and very often thousands if not millions of consumers or customers
* It is important to recognize that the marketing decision maker may not have made the most appropriate decision. In fact, there are no "right answers" in business and, ultimately, consumers are the only judges of whether we, as marketers, have made good decisions. What you want to practice is making and defending your decision based on appropriate analysis, application of marketing theory, concepts, and principles, and your judgment. Do not worry if you think that you might not have good judgment yet. That comes with experience and practice in making marketing decision.
* [def] The official definition of marketing adopted in 2004 by the American Marketing Association is: **marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationship in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholder**. The basic idea of this somwhat complicated definition of marketing is that marketing is all about creating and delivering value, and doing this for all parties involved in an exchange. This involves a decision-making process, and these decisions are typically (but not always) made by people who have official marketing roles in areas of an organization such as marketing department, a sales department, a marketing communications department, or a new product development department. Another definition of marketing is: **marketing is the process of achieving individual and organizational objectives by creating superior customer value for one or more target market with a sustainable strategy.** This definition suggests that "the prime directive" of marketing is to achieve objectives. **We do that by creating superior customer value--creating offers that are perceived as being more valuable to customers than any other solutions (competing brands), or even more valuable than the money in their wallet**. [def] **Customer value** is what you get from buying and using a product relative to the costs and sacrifices you incur to do so. **To create a transaction or an economic exchange of value, both parties need to believe that the exchange is fair--that what they get is worth more to them than what they give up.** Of course each of us has our own perceptions of how to best satisfy our needs, what is valuable, and what exchanges are "worth it". One enterprising entrepreneur in England recently offered deluxe 61-step car washes for $10,000. Enough customers thought the two-week process was worth it thathe has nine months' worth of business lined up. **The challenge to the marketer is to create, price, distribute, and communicate an attrative value proposition to the customer to get the most value in return**. (EX: Pepsi-cola hopes that the product, price, distribution, and communication decisions it makes for Aquafina result in a value proposition preferred by customers). This alternative definition also focuses on the idea of creating value for specific target markets, groups of people that have different needs, wants, or preferences from other groups of people and would seek a different value proposition(solution). Not everyone would want a $10,000 car wash, but apprently some people (sheiks and billionaires) do. This definition also suggests that we want to **develop a sustainable strategy**, not in the environmental sense, but in the sense of making a set of decision that will allow us to compete effectively until our objectives have been achieved--which ofr most organizations is a long term perspective

### Marketing is About Creating Customer Value
* One important part of our definition of marketing is taht it is about creating value for **diverse stakeholders**. [def] the term stakeholders here refers to **buyers, sellers, investors in a company, community residents, and even citizens of the nations where goods and services are made or sold**. [MY]: different from stakeholder from project management, which is people who is affected or can influence the project.
* One important stakeholder is the consumer. A consumer is the ultimate user of a good or service. Consumers can be individuals or organizations (although we usually use the term "customer" when referring to an organization), whether a company, government, charity, or association. So while some like to say "the customer is king", it is important to recognize that **marketing is not just about satisfying customer needs, it is about satisfying the needs of all the parties involved in an exchange**. **The seller needs to make a profit to stay in busienss to be able to continue offering the goods and services valued by the customer**. Similarly, a not-for-profit organization needs to match its supply of resources with custommer demand. This is the philosophy behind the marketing concept. The marketing concept suggests **organizational objectives such as long-term profitability are best met by first understanding what customers need (value sought) and then determining the associated costs of satisfying those needs (creating and delivering that value)--thus creating exchanges of mutual satisfaction.** Central to the philosophy reflected in the marketing concept is **an understanding that organizations exist to create value for consumers where it is neither efficient nor effective for consumers to attempt to satisfy their needs themselves.
* [def] **a need is the difference between a consumer's actual state and some ideal or desired state.** When the difference is big enough, the consumer is motivated to take action to satisfy the need. When you are hungry, you buy a snack. If you're not happy with your hair, you get a new look. **Needs are related to phsical conditions, such as being cold, hungry, or scared, and psychological conditions such as being liked, commmunicating with others, or being fulfilled**. The specific way a need is satisfied depends on an individual's history, learning experiences, and cultural environment. [def] **a want is a desire for a particular product used to satisfy a need in specific ways that are cultural and socially influenced** for example, two classmates' stomatchs runble during  a noon-hour class, and both need food. How each of them satisfies this need may be quite different. One might crave a salad or a bag of trail mix to go. The other might buy a cheeseburger and fries. On the want may be even more specific. I want Mountain Country Yogurt Trail Mix or a McDonald's cheeseburger. **Consumers are motivated by needs, but make purchase decisions based on wants.**
* **A product delivers a benefit when it satisfies a need or want.** **For marketers to be successful, they must develop products that provide one or more benefits**. **The challenge is to identify what benefits people look for, develop a product that delivers those benefits, and then convince buyers that it does so better than a competitor's product**. **As the management expert Peter Drucker worte, "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous**. **What Drucker means is if we succeed in creating a product that meets the needs of the customer, he or she will happily buy it without any "persuasion" from a salesperson. The salesperson may still be required to make the customer aware of the product and its relative merits in them--and typically less about the particular features or funcitons that deliver those benefits.** You buy a cordless drill because you care about the ease of making holes (the benefit). You may buy a particular brand of cordless drill because of differences in particular features that enable some drills to deliver the core benefit better than others.
* Everyone can want your product, but they doesn't ensure sales unless they have the means to obtain it. When you couple desire with the buying power or resources to satisfy a want, the result is **demand**. So, the potential customers for a snappy, red BMW convertible are the people who want the car minus those who can't afford to buy or lease one. **A market consists of all the consumers who share a common need that can be satisfied by a product purchase and who have the resources, willingness, and authority to make the purchase**.
* A marketplace used to be a location where buying and selling occurred face to face. The marketplace may still be a street corner or an open air market, but in today's "wired" world, buyers and sellers might not ever see each other. Increasingly the modern marketplace takes the form of a **glitzy shopping mall, a mail-order catalogue, a television shopping network, a eBay auction site, or an e-commerce website**.

### Marketing is About Exchange Relationships
* **At the heart of every marketing act--big or small--is something we refer to as an "exchange relationship"**. An exchange occurs when something is obtained for something else in return. **The buyer receives an object, service, or idea that satisfies a need and the seller receives something he or she believes is of equivalent economic value.** Usually this is money, but it could be other goods or services. Almost anything of value can be exchanged--including, **your time, your ideas, and the thing you can do**. Politicians exchange **promises for votes**, athletes and performers **exchange performances for ticket sales and exchange their images via endorsements in exchange for product sales**. Places like Canada's Wonderland or Prince Edward Island **exchange experiences for customers' time and money**. Not-for-profit organizations like Covenant House exchange **services for the time of their clients and exchange the concept of making a difference to the problem of homelessness for the money of their donators**. **For an exchange to occur, at least two people or organizations must be willing to make a trade, and each must have sommething the other wants. Both parties must agree on the value of the exchange and how it will be carried out. Each party also must be free to accept or reject the other's terms for the exchange.** Under these conditions, a gun-wielding rober's offer to "exchange" your money for your life does not constitute a valid economic exchange. 

### Marketing As a Decision-making Process
The American Marketing Association definition of marketing suggests that **marketing is primarily a decision-making process that allows individuals and organizations to achieve objectives by creating value that satisfies stakeholder needs and wants.** As such, marketing decision making involves a series of steps that entail both careful thought (planning) and action(executing). When it's done right, marketing is a strategic decision-making process in which marketing managers determine the most appropriate set of decision for a particular organization at a particular time that will help the organization meet its long term objective

##### Understand the Opportunity
* **Marketing decisions start with understanding the situation, or context, in which the decision need to be made.** **Situational analysis** involves identifying opportunities to create value for the organization by creating value for customers. First, it involes understanding factors relating to **the markets in which an organization competes**, such as **understanding general trends in that market, consumer or organizational buying behavior, industry dynamics, and the strategies and likely reactions of competitors**. The marketing decision makers need to assess factors relating to **their own organization and their ability to create value and compete effectively in those markets**. These internal factors include **understanding the relative effectiveness of their current marketing strategy, their resources, competencies, and expertise, and the values or mission of the organization**.

##### Specify the Value: Market Strategy
* Marketer make marketing strategy decisions to achieve the objectives of their organization, which usually include both **financial objectives (such as a particular profit target)** and **marketing objectives (such as sales targets or market share targets)**. **Once the marketing and other objectives are developed, the organization develops a marketing strategy aimed at achieving those objectives**.
* The **most critical** decision marketers make in developing marketing strategy is **the selection of the specific group of customers** on which they will focus their customer value creation efforts. [def] A market segment is **a distinct group of customers within a large market who have similar needs, wants, preferences, and behaviors, who seek similar product solution, and whose needs differ from other customers in the larger market**. Parents with young children, for example, typically seek different entertainment products than teenagers and young adults.
* [def] Market segmentation is **the process of dividing the overall market into groups of consumers who are sufficiently similar within the group to want a similar value offer and different enough from other groups to want a different value offer than those other groups**. The challenge is to identify groups with real differences in underlying needs, wants, preferences, behaivors, and opinions about value. Consequently, detailed segment profiles of each group msut be developed that specify these differences and other characteristics of the group that will help marketers design and present a valued offer.  For example, one way the Levi Strauss lices up the market is in terms of age segments--this makes sense, since different age group have different purposes. **Business-to-busienss markets** are someimtes divided into segments using characteristics such as type of business, decision-making criteria, size, or sales volume, if these characteristics reflect differences in the needs, wants, or behaivours of organizations.
* Marketers weigh each of the segments in terms of **profitability potential against a number of factors**, including **the organization's ability to create value and satisfy the needs of the segments**, **their goals and resources, and their ability to compete effectively against other offering**. On the basis of this analysis, the organization decides whether it will focus on a single segment or on several segments. The chosen market(s) become the organization's target market(s) toward which it directs its marketing efforts. For example, Hewitt is an outsourcing cojmpany that has decided to focus exclusively on the needs of the human resources professional. As the ad for Hewitt illustrates, it offers tailored solutino in HR areas such as talent, benefits, payroll, health care, retirement.
* Because different target markets have different and sometimes conflicting needs, wants, and preferences, marketers typically have to choose among alternative segments on which to focus. This is one of Richard Hill's dilemmas at Yellow Point Lodge--how to attract new consumers without turning off long-loyal consumers at the same time. Similarly, Canadian fashion designer Linda Lundstrom (and her company, Linda Lundstrom Ltd) doesn't make clothes for everyone. First, she designs clothes only for women. Lundstrom further narrows her market by focusing on the needs of women with less than perfect figures. She also gears her line toward working women who need clothes that can wear and travel well. Her most successful item is an extremely warm winter coat that combines comfort and function with a style based on First Nations artist Norval Morrisseau's traditional patterns.
* Some firms choose to reach as many customers as possible by offering their products to a mass market, which consists of all possible customers in a market, regardless of the difference in their specific needs and wants. This strategy, however, is not tenable in the long run. Usually competitors of mass markets, or even the mass marketers themselves, bring alternative products to market that have greater appeal to a subset of the people in the mass market, eroding the market share of the mass market product
* Many companies know that they must look for potential target markets beyond their own geographical borders to compete in today's world economy. Modern marketers are busy meeting the needs of people all around the world, especially when the demand for products at home flattens. Expanding internationally is desirable,, for example, to the Mattel Corporation (www.mattel.com). The average North American girl owns eight barbies, making it the best-selling toy ever. The domestic market is starting to become saturated, so Mattel is diversifying to offset the company's reliance on North American Barbie sales. Europe has nearly twice as many children as North America; and numbers in Mexico, South America, Japan, and Southeast Asia are even greater. Mattel now manufactures 75 percent of its toys in plants around the world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Mexico, and Italy
* **Positioning** After choosing the target market(s), marketers need to develop an offering that appeals to the needs, wants, and prefernces of the target market better than alternatives provided by competitors. This process starts with positioning the product. **Positioning** involves developing a marketing strategy to differentiate an offering from others in the marketplace in the mind of the target customers. It establishes how the marketing organization wants its brand to be known--what value it offers relative to competitors and why that offer is superior to others for a particular target market. Positioning also involves developing strategy to defend the image that has or will be created and specifying the unique competencies, resources, and know-how that allows a firm to sustain its superiority. The positioning of a brand often involves developing a brand personality. For example, VOSS Water (www.vosswater.com) has developed a personality of sophistication. Its water comes from a "virgin aquifer that has been shielded for centuries under ice and rock in the untouched wilderness of Central Norway". At prices ranging up to $22.00 for a 0.5L bottle, customers are putting a significant premium on that personality!

#### Create the Value: Marketing Mix Decisions
Once t he desired positioning is established, marketers need to create the value proposition reflected in the offer. To do this, marketers make a set of decisions about the product itself, its price, the place it is available for purchase, and the activities that introduce it to consumers. These decisions, collectively called the marketing mix decisions, create the value promised by the product positioning and are intended to be sufficiently motivating (valuable) to create a desired exchange response among members of the target market. Just as every college student seems to have an iPod, every government official seems to have a BlackBerry. The marketing mix decisions made by Apple and RIM created a value proposition so motivating that they have had trouble keeping up with demand.
* The marketing mix decisions are commonly known as the four Ps. **product, price, promotion(communication), and place(distribution). Together, the bundle of marketing mix elements represents an offer of value to the consumer: What the consumer will receive in an exchange. Sometimes marketers consider a fifth P, "people" or relationship. Others, including the authors of this book, view managing exchange relationship as being so central to what marketers do that it should be integrated into all the other marketing decisions and not treated as a separate decision.
* Just as a radio DJ puts together a collection of separate songs ( amusical mix) to create a certain mood, the idea of a mix in this context reminds us that no single marketing activity is sufficient to accomplish the organization's objectives, and that consistency among the decisions is critical to the overall marketing program.

###### Product
* **The product is a good, service, idea, place, person**--whatever is offered for exchange. Notice, therefore, that the concept of product as defined in marketing is broader than its usage in everyday language, where it primarily signifies a tangible good. Product strategy decisions begin with objectives: What do you want to achieve with your product decision? For example, Proctor & Gamble (P&G) wanted to expand its market share internationally but found that many consumers could not afford its traditional brands. This prompted P&G to develop new products, such as Pampers Uni diapers, that are tailored to meet the needs of international customers, such as those in Brazil, but have a significantly lower cost structure. Then you need to specify the product concept. What is the core value (benefit) you are offering, and how do you deliver that value through the features, functions, design, and other attributes of the product? Marketers also make product line decisions about how many variants or versions (models, types, sizes, colors, shapes, flavors) of a product they will offer. Honda, for example, chooses to compete with just a few models of cars, while General Moters has more than 100. Service strategy decisions also need to be made. Disneyland or Walt Disney World, the strategy to create the desired customer experience is central to what they do, but even packaged goods like cereal or consumer goods like a notebook computer can have important service aspects. Dell, for example, offers free delivery, online and phone-based technical support, and a range of options for getting your computer fixed if there is a problem, including in-home repair. Product decisions also include **branding strategy**: Will a product be part of a family of product like Cambell's soups, an individual brand like BlackBerry, a store brand like President's Choice, or just be named for the product category, like "Spaghetti"? Finally, **product decisions include packaging and labelling decisions. Be honest, how many times have you bought something because the package looked good?**

###### Price
* The price is the seller's assessment of the value of a product; what they would liketo receive from the buyer in exchange for the product. Pricing strategy decisions start with pricing objectives: What do you want to accomplish with your pricing decisions? Are you trying to support a premium position like Gucci, a competitive position like Zellers or Wal-Mart(lower prices), or you trying to increase market share, like Procter & Gamble in Brail? **Different pricing objectives suggest different pricing policies.** P & G used to determine its prices based on what a product actually cost to develop plus a profit, but now it prices products by what consumers in different countries can afford. Walmart uses Every Day Low Prices as a policy. Marketers also have to ome up with the actual price. Price point decisions need to take into consideration the cost of creating and delivering the product, competitors' prices, and what the customer is willing to pay, among other factors. There are also psychological consideraitons. Should the price of Croc shoes be $39.99 or $37.54, or $40.00? Finally, marketers need to decide or pricing terms and conditions: When does the price need to be paid, how can it be paid, are there any special deals or discounts?

###### Distribution
Place concerns the availability of the product to the customer at the desired time and locatino. Channels of distribution involve firms that work together to get a product from a producer to a consumer. For consumer goods like Root clothing products, a distribution channel includes retailer suchas Sears as well as their own Root retail outlets and the Root website. **Distribution decisions begin with specifying the distribution objectives: Are you trying to make the product as widely available as possible, minimize the cost of getting the product to the customer, or make it easy for customers to compare your product with others--such as with an Auto Mall?** To achieve one or another of these distribution objectives, marketers decide on a distribution system: **What type of distribution system will be created, how many traditional approach or non-traditional one?** Channel relationship management decisions also need to be made: How will you identify, attract, motivate, and keep your channel partners working toward your common goals and how will you deal with the conflict that is inherent between the roles of channel members? Finally, supply chain management involves systems and process to ensure efficient and effective value creation, from the sourcing of raw materials to the customer receiving the value. The include logistics, the physical distribution of goods to the customer, or a service blueprint for delivering a service experience.

###### Communication
Promotion refers to **the marketing commmunication activities undertaken to inform consumers or organizations about goods, services, or ideas, and to encourage potential customers to buy these goods, services, or ideas**. Unlike the other marketing mix decisions, **communication strategy decisions start with deciding the audience, or target of the commmunication, not the commmunication objective**. The audience is a specific subset of a target market whose members are the receives of the communication. **A communication campaign usually has many different elements targeted at different audiences, but we design the strategy for each audience.** For each audience we need to decide the commmunication objectives: **What do you want to achieve with your communication decisions? is the objective to create awareness about your product, develop purchase intentions, encourage trial of the product, or develop trust with your customers** To achieve these or other communications objectives, **marketers need to decide on an overall approach to the communication strategy: Will it be a push strategy where retailers are encouraged to stock products that customers can find or a pull strategy where customers are encouraged to seek products from retailers or other channel members?** Will it be one-way communication or will you seek feedback from customers and try to develop a relationship with them? Once the overall approach is decided, we need to decide the key messages; what we want to communicate to our audience; and the tactics we will use to get their attention. Then we decide on the appropriate communications mix to get our message(s) to our audience: Should we develop advertising for television, radio, or print pulications; create promotions like Tim Hortons' Roll Up the Rim to Win contest; use public relations as Raincoast Books used to gain free publicity around Harry Potter book launches; communicate using a sales force; create a website; or use viral marketing techniques such as developing entertaining video clips that customers can sendtheir friends? We also need to decide on a creative strategy that will get the attention of our audience, schedule the timing and placement of any advertising that is used, determine a budget to do all this, and develop a way to evaluate whether our communication strategy has been effective.
* For example, Mike's Hard Lemonade Company's communication strategy supports the brand image by developing and supporting the "personalities" of Mike and the lemonade. Cute stories about Mike and lemons were included on the packaging, and the product was brought to consumers' attention with print advertising, in-store displays, and on-shelf signage. After Mike's initial success, television advertising was created that showed "lemon being hurt real bad in the making of this product" and investigators trying to determine "who has been hurting the lemons". These quirky, light-hearted ads helped make Mike's the leading brand in the Canadian cooler market. There is also a hip Internet site (www.mikeshardlemonade.com) that further supports the brand's personality.


Because of all these, there are lots of decisions that marketers make for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Once made these decision need to be acted upon

### Implementation and Evaluation: Realize the Value
Before we can evaluate the realtive merits of our proposed marketing decisions we need plan for their implementatino, **such as identifying the key actions that need to be done, assigning tasks to people to do them, and developing a schedule of when they need to be completed.** Implementation decisions also involve developing **performance benchmarks(targets) to help us assess if our strategy is working** and **a contingency plan that outlines what we will do if things do not go as planned**. Finally, we need to **identify the key assumptions** that we have made in developing our plan and **outline how we will use market research to test those assumptions and ensure we are making informed decisions**. We also need to **specify and allocate a budget** to make all this happen.
* After planning the implementation, **we then need to decide whether or not to proceed.** This overall recommendation is based on an assessment of whether implementing the strategy **is worth it from the organization's perspective (value to the organization).** To make this decision we need to do *financial analysis* and *cost-benefit* analysis, which you will learn more about in Chapter 2. This decision is usually made in contrast to other viable alternatives, to ensure that the best strategy is being considered. **The alternatives typically come from different choice of target markets, different positioning, or different ways of creating value via the marketing mix. It may seem like a lot of wasted work to end up not recommending implementation--but you can't make an informed decision without first specifying the best strategy you can think of.**
* If you decide to implement the strategy, the next step is execution--getting it done and then measuring performance against the plan. Throughout this text we will show you examples of measures, or "metrics", that marketers use to assess their performance.
* In the final chapter, we will show you **how this marketing decision process comes together in the creation of a formal marketing plan**. Marketing planning is **a process of identifying and analyzing alternative ways of competing in the marketplace.** To see how much thinking and anylsis goes into marketing decisions, consider some of the many factors a firm like Levi Strauss has to think about when planning and developing its marketing strategy:

                * What jeans styles will our core customers of young people be looking for in three to five years?
                * What are our competitors doing to attract and keep our customers? How are we positioned competitively in the mind of the consumer?
                * Which customer groups that don't currently buy a lot of blue jeans might we target for Levi's products?
                * How will new developments in computerized production technologies affect the denim manufacturing process?
                * Will the current trend for many companies to institute "Causal Fridays" when employees can wear jeans to work, affect long term demand for Levi's products
                * What will be the impact on our brand's image if we decide to sell our jeans through discount stores such as Walmart?
                * Is television advertising (an expensive marketing commmunications tool) the right way to communicate with our target market, or is there a better way?
                * How will consumers' growing awareness about the use of child labour in Third World countries affect their attitude toward manufacturers that locate plants overseas?

* an example of a marketing plan in the appendix, Chpater 2 focuses on the environment of marketing decisions and introduces the internal and external environment. Chapter 3 focuses on how to make target market and positioning decisions. Chapter 4 gives you an introduction to the research marketers do to make informed decisions. Chapters 5 and 6 examine key consumer and organizational buying behavior concepts that help us develop better market segment profiles. Chapter 7 through 13 focus on the marketing mix decisions. Chapter 14 pulls it all together and shows you how all the marketing decisions must support each other in the writing of a marketing plan and how the tools, concepts, and principles discussed throughout the text can be used to provide rationale for a particular course of action.

### The Marketing of Value
* So far, we have talked a lot about marketing delivering value to customers. As we noted as the beginning of this chapter, value refers to the benefits a customer receives from buying a good or service relative to the costs of acquiring and using it. Marketing then communicates these benefits to the customer in the form of a value proposition, **a marketplace offering that fairly and accurately sums up the value that the customer will realize if he or she purchases the product**. The challenge to the marketers is to create an attractive value proposition. A bit part of this challenge is convincing customers that this value proposition is superior to others they might choose from competitors.
* How do customers (such as your potential employer) decide how much value they will get from a purchase? **One way to look at value is to think of it simply as a ratio of benefits to costs--that is, customers "invest" their precious time and money to do business with a firm, and they expect a certain bundle of benefits in return**. **But here's the tricky part. Value is in the eye of the beholder, meaning that something (or someone) may be worth a lot to the planet, but a prospective employer may form a different opinion.** **A big part of marketing is ensuring that the thing being exchanged is appreciated for the value it holds**. Let's look at value from the different perspectives of the parties that are involved in an exchange: the customers, the sellers, and society.

###### Value from the Customer's Perspective
SKIM: [summary] the value proposition includes the whole bundle of benefits the firm promise to deliver, like making a statement about the type of person you are or wish you were.

###### Value from the Seller's Perspective
* SKIM: [summary] They determine whether the exchange is profitable to the seller. That's a very important factor, but not the only one. For example, in addition to making a buck or two, many firms measure value along other dimensions, such as prestige among rivals or pride in doing what they do well. Some firms by definition doen't even care about making money, or they may not even be allow to make money; nonprofit like Greenpeace, the Canadian Cancer Society, or CBC Radio regard value in terms of their ability to motivate, educate, or delight the public.
* Company that calculate the lifetime value of a customer look at how much profit they expect to make from a particular customer, including each and every purchase he or she will make from them now and in the future. To calculate lifetime value, company estimate the amount the person will spend and then subtract what it will cost to maintain this relationship. College and university students are particularly important to banks because you represent a lifetime of value to them, and while you might not have much money now, one day you probably will.

###### Providing Value To Stakeholders By Creating a Competitive Advantage
* All things being equal, a firm creates value for stakeholders when it convinces customers that they will acquire greater value by buying its products rather than those of competitors. How are companies able to accomplish this goal? The answer is that the underlying goal of all marketing strategies is to create a competitive advantage for the firm. A firm has a **competitive advantage when it is able to outperform the commpetition, providing customers with a benefit the competition can't.** A competitive advantage gives consumers a reason to choose one product over another again and again.
* How does a firm go about creating a competitive advantage. The first step is to **identify what it does really well. A distinctive competency is a firm's capability that is superior to that of its competition.** For example, Coca-Cola's success in global markets--Coke commands 50 percent of the world's soft drink business--is relatived to its distinctive commpetencies in distribution and marketing communications. Coke's distribution system got a jump on the competition during World War II. To enable soldiers fighting overseas to enjoy a five-cent Coke, the US government assisted Coca-Cola in building 64 overseas bottling plants. Coke's skilful marketing commmunications program, a second distinctive competency, has contributed to its global success. In addtion to its television commmercials, Coke blankets less-developed countries such as Tanzania with its print advertisements so that even people without televisions will think of Coke when they get thirsty.
* The second step in developing a competitive advantage is **to turn a distinctive competency into differential benefit--one that is important to customers**. Differential benefits **set product apart from competitiros' products by providing something unique that customers want. Differential benefits provide reasons for customers to pay a premium for a firm's products and exhibit a strong brand preference**. For many years loyal Apple computer users benefited from **superior graphics capability** compared to their PC-using counterparts. Later, when PC manufacturers caught up with this competitive advantage, Apple relied on **its inventive product designers to create another differential benefit--futuristic looking computers in a multitude of colours**. This competitive advantage even caused many loyal PC users to take a bite of the Apple.

###### Adding Value Through the Value Chain
* Many different players--both within and outside a firm--need to work together to create and deliver value to customers. One approach to understanding the delivery of value and satisfaction is the value chain. This term refers to a series of activities involved in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting any product. In addition to marketing activities, the value chain includes business functions such as human resource management and technology development.
* This concept reminds us that every product starts with raw materials that are of relatively limited avalue to the end customer. Each link in the chain has the potential to either add or remove value from the product the customer eventually buys. The successful firm is t he one that can perform one or more of these activities better than other firms--this is its competitive advantage. The main activies of value-chain members include the following:

        * Bring in materials to make the product, referred to as "inbound logistics"
        * Converting the materials in to the final product, referred to as "operations"
        * Shipping out the final product, referred to as "outbound logistics"
        * Marketing the final product, in which marketing and sales come into play
        * Servicing the product/customer, referred to as "service" 

* A Value Chain for the Apple iPod

        Inbound Logistics
        * Planar lithium battery (Sony)
        * Hard drive (Toshiba)
        * MP3 decoder and controller chip (Portal Player)
        * Flash memory chip (Sharp Electronics Corp.)
        * Stero digital-to-analog converter (Wolfson Microelectronics Ltd)
        * Firewire interface controller (Texas Instruments)

        Operations
        * Consumer research
        * New-product-development team
        * Engineering and production

        Outbound logistics
        * Trucking companies
        * Wholesalers
        * Retailers

        Marketing and Sales
        * Advertising
        * Sales force

        Service
        * Computer technicians

* All these companies (and more) belong to Apple's value chain. This means that Apple must make a lot of value-chain decisions. What electronic components will go into its music players? What accessories will be included in the package? What trucking companies, wholesalers, and retailers will deliver the iPods to stores? What service will it provide to customers after the sale? And what marketing strategies will it use? In some cases, **members of a value chain will work together to coordinate their activities** to be more efficient and thus create a competitive advantage
* We will start with a focus on how companies decide what to make, how and where to sell it, and whom to sell it to. Then, we'll take a look at how they decide to "position" the product in the marketplace, including choices about what it should look like, how its value should be communicated to customers, and how much to charge for it. As we reach the end of our marketing journey, we'll talk about how the product actually gets delivered to consumers.

#### value from Society's Perspective
* Every company's activities influence the world around it, in ways both good and bad. Therefore, we must also consider how marketing transactions add or subtract value from society. In many ways, we are at the mercy of marketers because we trust them to sell us products that are safe and perform as promised. We also trust them to price and distribute these products fairly. Conflicts often arise in business when the pressure to succeed in the marketplace provokes dishonest business practices--the collapse of energy giant Enron and the tiral of its (later) former chief executive officer Ken Lay are a case in point.

###### The Dark Side of Marketing
* Whether intentionally or not, some marketers do violate their bond of trust with consumers, and unfortunately the "dark side" of marketing often is the subject of harsh criticism. In some cases, these violations are illegal, such as when retailer **adopt a "bait-and-switch" selling strategy, luring consumers into the store with promises of inexpensive products with the sole intent of getting them to switch to higher-priced goods.**
* In other cases, marketing practices have detrimental effects on society even though they are not actually illegal. Some alcohol and tobacco companies *advertise in low-income neighbourhoods* where abuse of these products is a big problem. Other sponsor commercials depicting groups of people in an unfavourable light or *sell products that encourage antisocial behavior*. An online game based on the Columbine High School massacre drew criticism from some (including the father of a student who died in the 1999 attack) who say it trivializes the actions of the two teen killers.
* Some harmful consumer behaviors such as excessive drinking or cigarette smoking stem from social pressures, and the cultural value placed on money encourages activities such as shoplifting or insurance fraud. Exposure to unattainalbe ideals of beauty and success can create dissatisfaction with the self. Let's briefly review some dimensions of "the dark side" of consumer behaviour.

        1. **marketers create artificial needs** The marketing system has come under fire from both ends of the political spectrum. On the one hand, some members of the religious right believe that advertising contributes to the moral breakdown of society by presenting images of sinful pleasure. On the other hand, some leftists argue that the same deceitful promises of material pleasure function to buy off people who would otherwise be revolutionaries working to change the system. They argue that the system creates demand that only its products can satisfy. **A Response**: A need is a basic motive, while a want represents one way that society has taught us the need can be satisfied. For example, while thirst is biologically based, we are taught to want Coca-Cola to satisfy that thirst rather than, say, water. Thus, the need is already there; marketers simply recommend ways to satisfy it. If the basic need is not there, no amount of slick marketing communication tactics is going to convince consumers to buy.
        2. Marketing teaches us to value people for what they own rather than who they are. Goods are arbitrarily linked to desireable qualities, so we learn that we can be popular, happy, and fulfilled only if we buy these products. A response: Products meet existing needs, and advertising only helps to communicate their availability. Advertising is an important source of consumer information. It is a service for which consumers are willing to pay because the information it provides reduce the time and effort needed to learn about the product

### Careers in Marketing
* Many students asume that the "typical" marketing job is in a large, consumer-oriented packaged goods commpany like Procter&Gamble. In fact, marketers work in other types of organizations, for example:

        Service organizations (e.g., Telus, Intrawest)
        E-commerce organizations (e.g., Chapters Online; Amazon.ca)
        Technology companies (e.g., IBM Canada; Bombardier)
        Industrial equipment companies (e.g., Komatsu; Nortel)
        Retailers (e.g., Shoppers Drug mart; Sears)

        2. Do you think students should study marketing even if they are not planning a career in marketing or busienss? Explain your reasoning.
        3. In this chapter, a number of criticisms of marketing were discussed. Have you heard these criticisms before? What other criticisms of marketing have you heard? Do you agree or disagree with these criticisms, and why?

* Marketing Practice:

        1. An old friend of yours has been making and selling leather handbags and bookbags to acquaintances and friends for some time and is now thinking about opening a shop in your town. But he is worried about whether he'll have enough customers who want handcrafted bags to keep a business going. Knowing that you are a marketing student, he asks you for some advice. What can you tell him about market segments, target markets, product, price, marketing communications, and distribution strategies that will help him get his business off the ground?
        2. Assume that you are employed by your city's chamber of commerce. A major focus of the chamber is to get industires to move to your city. As a former marketing student, you know that there are issues involving product, price, marketing communications, and even distribution that can attract busienss. Next week, you have an opportunity to speak to the members of the chamber, and your topic will be "Marketing a City". Develop an outline for that presentation
        3. As a marketing professional, you have been asked to write a short piece ofr a local business newsletter about the state of marketing today. You think the best way to address this topic is to review how the marketing concept has evolved and to discuss the New Era orientation of marketing. Write the short article you will submit to the editor of the newsletter.
        4. You and your friends sometimes discuss the various courses you are taking. One of your friends says to you, "Marketing's nothing but selling stuff. Anybody can do that without taking a course." Another friend says, "yeah, all marketers do is write ads". As a role-playing exercise, present your argument against these statements to your class.

* Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing

        The purpose of this mini-project is to develop an understanding of the importance of marketing to different organization.
        1. Working as a team with two or three other students in your class, select an organization in your community that practices marketing. it may be a manufacturer, service provider, retailer, not-for-profit organization--almost any organization will do. Schedule a visit with someone in the organization who is involved in the marketing activities. Ask that person to give your group a tour of the facilities and explain the organization's marketing activities.
        2. Divide the following topics among your team, and ask each person to be responsible for developing a set of questions to ask during the interview to learn about the comapny's program:

                * What customer segment the company targets
                * How it determines needs and wants
                * What products it offers, including features, benefits, and goals for customer satisfaction
                * What its pricing strategies are, including any discounting policies
                * What marketing communication strategies it uses, and what these emphasize to position the product(s)
                * How it distributes products, and whether it has encountered any problems
                * How marketing planning is done and who does it
                * Whether social responsibility is part of the marketing program and, if so, in what way
                
        3. Develop a team report of your findings. In each section of the report, share what you learned that is new or surprising to you compared to what you expected (based on your reading of Chapter 1)
        4. Develop a team presentation for your class that summarizes your findings. Conclude your presentation with ocmments on what your team believes the company was doing well and where it could make improvements.

* Real People, Real Surfers: exploring the Web

        The New Era orientation means that a firm like Mountain Equipment Co-op is devoted to excellence in sourcing and producing products that benefit customers as well as society, the organization's employees, and their members. Many firms share this on their Internet webpages, Visit  the website for Mountain Equipment Co-op (www.mec.ca). Then visit the website for one of their competitors such as REI (www.REI.com) or Taiga (www.taigaworks.ca). Follow the links in the sites to learn as much as you can about the company. You might first check the site map to see what links are provided on the site. Look for answers to the following questions.

                1. What evidence do you find on the firms' websites that each is a New Era firm?
                2. Which company has the better webiste? What makes it better? Based on your visit to the webiste, what do you think is the major purpose of each company's site? To promote their products? To sell on the web? To develop a brand image? Something else?
                3. How does each company use its webiste for promoting its products? Is the website a unique form of marketing communications or jsut an extension of their normal advertising?
                4. What market segment do you think each firm is targeting with its website? What features of the websites gave you this idea?
                5. Do the websites provide an opportunity for the firm to gather information about customers so that it can customize contact with them
                6. Are there any features of the website that will cause consumers to come back again and again?
                7. What are your major criticisms of each of the webiste? What would you do to improve each site from a marketing perspective?

### Case Study

# Chapter 2: Making Strategic Marketing Decisions
* Case study: Michel Bendayan with Megablok (www.megabloks.com). SKIM
* Whether a firm is a not-for-profit organization like the United Way, a family-based retailer like Army & Navy department stores, or a major manufacturer like Mega Bloks, **planning for the future in a key to prosperity. Success in the competitive world of business is not accidental; businesses that succeed do so because they are capable of developing and implementing superior strategies in the marketplace. Often, businesses that fail meet their fate because of improper planning**
* All firms operate in a dynamic environment. In today's world of business, consumer interests, technologies, commpetition, and the economy are changing faster than ever. This makes good planning more important than ever, as planning enables a firm to meet the challenges of this dynamic environment and to control its own destiny.
* In this chapter, we'll look at the different steps in creating and implementing plans within a business organization. First we'll examine **how marketers make the decisions that guide the entire organization**. Then we'll examine how marketers make the marketing decision outlined in Chapter 1. Finally, we will discuss the global and ethical context in which marketing decisions are made.
* In successful firms, both large and small, **business planning is an ongoing process of making decisions that guide the firm both in the short term and for the long haul. Planning identifies and builds on a firm's strengths and helps managers at all levels make informed decisions in a changing business environment. Planning means that an  organization develops objectives before it takes action**. In large firms, such as IBM, Sony, and L'Oreal, which operate in many markets, **planning is a complex process involving many people from different areas of the company's operations**. In a small business like Mac's Diner, however, planning is quite different; Mac himself is chief cook, occasional dishwasher, and the sole company planner. With mid-size firms, the planning process falls somewhere in between, depending on the size of the firm and the complexity of its operations.
* Business plan's process is more complex than our day-to-day planning. Business planning usually occurs on an annual basis at three level--strategic planning, marketing planning, and operational planning.

                * What it is: Strategic Planning
                * Who does it: planning done by top-level corporate management
                * What they do: 
                        1. Define the mission
                        2. Evaluate the internal and external environment
                        3. Set organizational or SBU objectives
                        4. Establish the business portfolio (if applicable)
                        5. Develop growth strategies and tactics

                * What it is: Functional Planning (In Marketing Department, called Marketing Planning)
                * Who does it: Planning done by top functional-level management such as the firm's chief marketing officer (CMO)
                * What they do:
                        1. Perform a situation analysis
                        2. Set marketing objectives 
                        3. Develop marketing strategies

                        5. Monitor and control marketing strategies

                * What it is: Operatinoal Planning
                * Who does it: Planning done by supervisory managers
                * What they do: 
                        1. Develop action plans to implement the marketing plan
                        2. Use marketing metrics to monitor how the plan is working

* **Strategic planning** is the managerial decision process that matches the organization's resources (for example, manufacturing facilities, financial assets, and skilled workforce) and capabilities to its market opportunities for long-term growth. These decisions focus on the firm's ability to respond to changes and opportunities in its environment. **In a strategic plan, the top management team (that is, the chief executive officer, or CEO, president, and other top executives) defines the firm's purpose (mission) and specifies what the firm hopes to achieve over the next few years (organizational objectives)**. Increasingly this planning takes place in consultation with a cross-section of employees who bring varied perspectives and knowledge to the process. For example, a firm's strategic plan may set a goal of increasing t he firm's total revenues by 10 or even 20 percent in the next five years. Strategies and tactics are then developed for achieving those objective. **Strategies reflect what a firm is going to do to achieve an objective. For example, to increase total revenues by 20 percent in the next five years, an organization like Mega Bloks may decide to enter a new market with either new or existing products.** **Tactics reflect how a strategy is going to be implemented. For example, Mega Bloks may decide to enter the Japanese market with a product line customized for the Japanese consumer**.
* Strategic plans are usually developed for a period of three to five years and take a long-term view of the strategic health of the business. In large firms, strategic planning can actually occur at two different levels. **First, there is overall corporate strategic planning, which determines the organization's different business and product pursuits. Second, the individual business units do strategic planning for their products.** **Strategic planning at the Walt Disney Company, for example, involves an assessment of resources and capabilities for starting new business. In addition to making movies and running theme parks, Disney is now in the cruise ship business and operates a number of Disney vacation resorts. Disney's corporate planning expanded its theme park business to Europe and Japan--separate business units**.
* **Given its high-level, long-term emphasis, a strategic plan is not a document that can be readily implemented. Therefore firms develop a one-year plan, called the marketing plan, which takes its direction from the strategic plan and develops lower-level strategies and tactics for achieving the objectives specified in the strategic plan.** There are two main differences between a strategic plan and a marketing plan. The first is time horizon. While the strategic plan is developed for a period of three to five years, the marketing plan is typically developed for a period of one year. **The second difference is that the marketing plan contains details regarding the marketing mix elements (product strategy, pricing strategy, channel of distribution strategy, marketing communication strategy), while the strategic plan does not contain this level of detail**. What is sometimes confusing about strategies and tactics is that a tactic at the organizational (strategic plan) level becomes, or is reflected in, the strategy at the functional level, and functional level tactics become, or are reflected in, operational strategies.
* **For example, at the strategic planning level, Mega Blok's strategy may be to expand internationally. Their tactic to do this may be to enter t he japanese market with a product line customized for the Japanese consumer. At the marketing planning level, this becomes the strategy to achieve more specific marketing objectives such as "have 20 percent of sales come from new markets this year" and "earn a profit of $5 million from those new market sales". At the marketing planning level, the marketing mix decisions to achieve this market entry strategy are the tactics that specify how the strategy will be implemented and the objectives achieved. In the operational (or immmplementation) plan, a marketing mix decision such as establishing a unique Japanese brand personality for Mega Bloks in Japan becomes the strategy (what you are going to do) while decisions reflecting how this will be done, such as hiring an advertising agency to create a Japanese anime cartoon character, are the tactics. So while strategies reflect what to do and tactics reflect how to do it, they are related across levels of analysis and differ in increasing levels of specificity.**
* Perhaps you are beginning to see the central role played by marketers in the organizatinoal, functional, and operational planning process. **The development of the marketing plan enables the business to set priorities regarding markets it wants to compete in (market segment), customers it wants to serve (target customers), and how it plans to serve those customers (marketing mix strategy). Once these priorities are set, the business develops a set of more specific plans** such as a sales plan, production plan, finance plan, supply chain plan, a human resource plan. Collectively, some businesses call these plans the operating plans or tactical plans. Based upon the requirements of each functional plan, the business is now in a position to allocate resources for the year by setting a budget. Although this process starts from the top of an organization and works its way down to specific tactical decisions, it is typically a two-way process. Marketing and other functional plans are adapted based on the specific objectives and decisions reflected in operational plans and strategic plans are adapted based on the specific objectives and decisions reflected in the functional plans.

### STRATEGIC PLANNING: GUIDING THE BUSINESS
* Marketers don't work and plan in isolation. Before we talk about the marketing planning process, therefore, we need to understand how firms develop strategic plans. In this section, we'll take a closer look at **the five key stages in top-level strategic planning: defining the organization's business mission, evaluating the environment (situational analysis), setting organizational objectives, planning the business portfolio, and devloping growth strategies**.

#### Step 1: Define the Mission
* Top management's first step in the strategic planning process is to answer questions such as: **What business are we in? What customers should we serve? How should we develop the firm's capabilities and focus its effort?**
* In many organizations, the nawers to questions such is these become the lead items in the organizations's strateic plan. The answers become part of the mission statement--a formal description of the organization's purpose and what it hopes to achieve in terms of creating value for customers with what products and resources. For example, the mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is "to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime, and prevent underage drinking"
* The idea mission statement is not too broad, too narrow, or too short-sighted. Amission that is too broad will not provide adequate focus for the organization. It doesn't do much good to claim: "We are in the business of making high-quality product"; yet it's hard to find a firm that doesn't make this claim. **However, a mission statement that is too narrow may inhibit managers' ability to visualize possible growth opportunities. If, for example, a firm sees itself in terms of its product only, consumer trend or technology can make that product obsolete--and the firm is left with no future. If Xerox had continued to define its mission in terms of just producing copy machines instead of providing "document solutions", the shift to electronic documents would have left them in the dust the way the Model T Ford replaced the horse and buggy.** Similarly, imagine the disastrous consequences that would happen to McDonald's if its mission statement read:"We are in the hamburger business." It's important to remember that the need for a clear mission statement applies to virtually any type of organization, even those like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, whose objective is to serve society rather than to sell goods or services. Xerox is not alone in its effort to redefine itself. Philip Morris, once simply a tobacco products company, has redefined itself strategically as a consumer products company, offering many of the products we consume on a regular basis. Mission statements should also inspire customers and other stakeholders to want to do business with an organization. **The mission of Campbell's soup, for example, is "Together we will build the world's most extraordinary food company by nourishing people's lives everywhere, every day".**

#### Step 2: Conduct an Environmental (Situational) Analysis
* The second step in strategic planning is **an assessment of an organization's environment, both external and internal. This process is referred to as a *situation analysis*, *environmental analysis*, or sometimes a *business review*.** The external environment consists of t hose uncontrollable elements outside of the organization that may affect it either positively or negatively. While this can include everything from consumers to government regulations to competitors to the economy, there are four main categories of considerations. The first is looking for trends or issues in the macro or general environment that might have a positive or negative effect on your organization. These may be **p**olitical or legal, **e**conomic, **s**ocial or cultural, **t**echnological, or **o**ther (**p.e.s.t.o**) trends or issues that might impact a particular industry and business. **Mega Bloks, for example, might need to understand political or legal issues relating to foreign ownership of joint ventures before deciding how to enter the Japanese market. Similarly, Mega Bloks has to consider the implication of children, all around the world, being increasingly interested in electonic games.** McDonald's has to consider the implications of government imposing "fat" taxes or regulating the use of trans fats in the preparation and consumption of food and consider the social trend toward healthier lifestyles. Canadian lumber companies have to consider the relative strength of the Canadian dollar when developing export strategies. Media producer need to understand the implication of RSS feed technology as teenagers and young adult increasingly seek to customize information and entertainment products accessed via the internet.
* The external environment also includes detailed **cnosumer analysis**. We will be examining these issues in much more detail in Chapter 5 and 6, but this is where you would look for **trends, issues, or considerations with respect to changing consumer segment, segment profiles, and segment sizes**. While socio-cultural trends are more general across society, consumer analysis is focused on understanding specific market segment. **For example, Mega Bloks would need to understand the extent to which "North American" products are perceived positively among consumers in key Japanese market segments.**
*  The external environment also includes industry analysis. Industry considerations might include factors like **industry size and competitiveness, industry structure, industry dynamics (trends, norms, etc), stage of the product life cycle (see Chapter 8), and industry key success factors.** Again, we are just looking for factors that might positively or negatively impact our strategic decisions. **For example, a new entrant into the computer printer industry should understand that manufacturers make little, if any, money on selling the printers, but make significant margins selling ink.**
* Finally, we give consideraiton to **competitive analysis--identifying the key competitors, understanding their strategies and strengths and weaknesses, as well as anticipating likely future strategic changes. Mega Bloks, for example, need to understand and anticipate Lego's marketing strategy in Japan, as well as the strategies of domestic competitors to make an informed market-entry decision.**
* When conducting this situational analysis, **marketers focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of the environment in which they are competing**. This includes a solid understanding of their own organization and its abilities to create value and compete effectively. As illustrated below, **the internal environment is all the controllable elements inside an organization that understand the current strategy of the organization and assess how well that strategy is working: How superior is the current value created by the firm's product. How effective is the current marketing mix? What is the relative market share of these products? What has been their financial performance? Marketers also need to understand the resources and competencies of the organization; its technology, intellectual capital, and other assets. For example, firms need to have appropriate technical skills to compete in their industry. Their employees need to have appropriate skills, abilities, and training to produce the firm's products. A firm's physical facilities can be an important asset for creating customer value, as can its level of financial stability, its relationships with suppliers and channel members, its corporate reputation, and its ownership of strong brands in the marketplace. Marketers also need to understand the organization of the firm--its structure, culture, and system (how they get work done). Some firms, for example, have a positive work climate that encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. Other firms find they have a "chilly" climate, characterized by negativity, work-to-rule, and in-fighting among employees--which can seriously affect product quality and relationship with customers, suppliers, distributors, and other stakeholders. Finally the belief, value, and preference of senior management in an organization need to be understood for marketers to consider organization-appropriate alternatives in making key marketing decisions.**

#### Step 3: Set Organizational or SBU Objective
* After constructing a mission statement and understanding the decision environment, top management sets organizational or strategic business unit (SBU) objectives. Very large corporations are normally divided into self-contained divisions, or SBU. Bombardier, for example, produces transportation vehicles ranging from commercial aircraft to high-speed trains, with each product class organized in an SBU. Bombardier Learjet is an SBU of Bombardier. Bombardier Learjet operates as an independent busienss with its own mission and objectives--and its own marketing strategy. Organization and SBU objectives are a direct outgrowth of the mission statement and broadly identify what the ifrm hopes to accomplish within the general time frame of the firm's long-range business plan.
* To be effective, objectives need to be specific, measurable (so firms can tell whether they've met them or not) and attainable. Attainability is especially important--firms that establish "pie in the sky" objectives they can't realistically obtain can create frustration for their employee (who work hard but get no satisfaction of accomplishment) and other stakeholders in the firm, such as vendors and shareholders who are affected when the firm doesn't meet its objectives.
* Objectives may related to **revenue and sales, profibility, the firm's standing in the market, return on investment, productivity, product development, customer relation and satisfaction, and social responsibility.** To ensure measurability, objectives are often stated in numerical terms. For example, a firm might have as an objective a 10 percent increase in profitability. It could reach this objective by increasing productivity, by reducing costs, or by selling off an unprofitable division. Or it might meet this 10 percent objective by developing new products, investing in new technologies, or entering a new market. If you are a business major, you will learn a lot more about setting and specifying objectives in your organizational behavior and business strategy courses.

#### Step 4: Establish the Business Portfolio
* For companies with several different SBU, strategic planning includes making decisionss about how to best allocate resources across these businesses to ensure growth for the total organization. Each SBU has its own focus within the firm's overall strategic plan, and each has its own target market and strategies for reaching its objectives. Just like an independent business, each SBU is a separate profit centre within the larger corporation--that is, each SBU within the firm is responsible for its own costs, revenues, and profits.
* Just as the collection of different stocks an investor owns is called a portfolio, the range of different businesses that a large firm operates is called its business portfolio. As with the Bombardier example, these different busiensses usually represent very different product lines, each of which operates with its own budget and management. Having a diversified business portfolio reduces the firm's dependence on one product line or one group of customers. For example, if travel suffers and Disney has a bad year in theme-park attendance and cruises, its managers hope that the lost sales will be made up by stay-at-homers who go to Disney movies and watch Disney's television networks. There are a variety of portfolio analysis tools available to marketers to help them decide which mix of business units makes most sense in their context, but the use of these tools is typically addressed in a marketing strategy course, and is beyond the scope of this text.

#### Step 5: Develop Growth Strategies
* Although portfolio analysis tools can help managers decide which SBU they should invest in for growth, it doesn't tell them much about how to make that growth happen. Should the growth of an SBU come from finding new customers, from developing new variations of the product, or from some other growth strategy? Part of teh strategic planning at the SBU level entails evaluating growth strategies.
* Marketing penetraion strategies (**Existing products, existing markets**) seek to increase sales of existing products to existing markets such as current users, nonusers, and users of competing brands within a market. For example, Cambell's can advertise new uses for soup in lunches and dinners, encourage current customers to eat more soup, and prod nonusers to find reasons to buy soup. The firm might try to increase sales by cutting prices, improving distribution, or conducting promotions aimed at attracting users of competing soup brands.
* Market development strategies (**Existing Products, new markets**) introduce existing products to new markets. This strategy can mean expanding into a new geographic area, or it may mean reaching new customer segments within an existing geographic market. For example, Red Bull, the "energy" drink that had its beginnings in the 1990s as a cult favorite among the merging young club crowd, is trying to move up the generational chain to attract older users as well. To do this, Red Bull has recently migrated some of its marketing efforts from edgy ads to mainstream messages. Founder and largest shareholder Dietrich Mateschitz understands the dollar power of the older generation, and to appeal to them he has broadened Red Bull's distribution into stores, restaurants, and clubs they frequent. Mateschitz is betting on the vast numbers of clubbers' parents to prop up sales, especially now that the heavyweights like Coca-Cola, pepsiCo, and Anheuser-Busch are trying to make inroads in to the market for energy drinks.
* Product development strategies (**New Products, Existing Markets**) create growth by selling new products in existing markets. Product development may mean extending the firm's product line by developing new variations of the item, or it may mean altering or improving the product to provide enhanced performance. Take the humble mattress, for example. Lately, busienss-class hotels like Sheraton and Marriott have been engaged in something of a "mattress war"--that is, each one is trying to convince the traveller that its bed is softer, mroe comfortable, and more inviting than the competition's (and in some cases, if you fall in love with the bed you can actually buy it and take it home). This "sleeper" strategy appears to be effective: Radisson Hotels' research with guests told it that the mere fact that a bed was "upgraded" would allow the chain to charge an additional $10 per room. These new age beds carry their own brand name-- "Heavenly Bed" at Westin, "The Revive Collection" at Marriott, and "Sweet Sleeper" at Sherraton. Radisson's "Sleeper Number" beds even allow each occupant to adjust the firmness of his or her side with a remote control device. A product development strategy like that is waking up the hotel industry, as the major players (and some smaller luxury hotels) and now scrambling to merchadinse other room elements, such as toiletries.
* Diversification strategies (**New Product, New Markets**) emphasize both new products and new markets to achieve growth. After a long period of sluggish performance in the fast food market, McDonald's has re-energized itself over the past several years through successful strategic planning. For example, feeling that it was maxing out in the hamburger business in the late 1990, McDonald's sought to attract different customers with lines of business to diversify its portfolio of food offerings. Among those are Donatos Pizza, Boston Market, and a controlling interest in Chipotle Mexican Grills. Interestingly, now that its core business is back on track, McDonald's has begun to divest some of these other brands and is shifting from diversification back to more of a product development strategy around the core McDonald's brand.

### The Marketing Planning Process
* Marketing plannings uses the output of the strategic planning process as an input--that is, **the strategic planning process provides the context in which marketing planning is conducted.** Solid planning means that a firm has a viable product at a price consumers are willing to pay, the means to get that product to the place consumers want it, and a way to communicate (promote) the product to the right consumers. The marketing planning process culminates in the development of a formal document called the **marketing plan**. Although we will discuss the process of developing a marketing plan in great detail in Chapter 14, let us briefly examine the marketing plan template shown below.

#### Understand the Opportunity
* The marketing planning process begins with a thorough analysis of the decision context facing the firm. The situational analysis conducted for the strategic plan is reviewed and updated and any constraints, assumptions, or other decision parameters that need to be taken into consideration are identified. A strategic assessment of the situation is then conducted to identify the key facts, factors, or observations in the external and internal environments that have the most immportant implications or bearing on the marketing planning. Some environmental considerations are more important to understand than others. For example, Mega Bloks might choose to enter the Japanese market differently if it were able to get patent protection on its building blocks. Richard Hill, at yellow Point Lodge, need to find a strategy consistent with the strong sense of history and tradition of his long-loyal customers. The challenge is in identifying the most important considerations on which to base your marketing strategy.
* **SOT analysis** is one tool often used by marketers (and other planners) in this task. SWOT analysis seeks to identify meaningful strengths and weakness in the organization's internal environment, and opportunities and threats from the external environment. In conducting a SWOT analysis and try to identify the immplications of each of these considerations. For each fact or observation, ask yourself: **why is it important to understand this information? How does it impact a decision that I need to make? Is it a strength of my organization that will help me create superior customer value or defend my desired positioning, or is it a weakness that undermines that ability and would need to be addressed or mitigated (reduce in effect)? Is it an opportunity in the external environment that my organization could exploit or take advantage of in creating or defending value creation or is it a threat that impedes or otherwise limits my organization's ability to compete effectively?**
* If the implication does not have a direct bearing on a decision you have to make, it probably isn't very important and does not need to be included in the SWOT analysis. Determining the strategic implications and what is important and not important can take many years of experience--and you have to practice doing SWOT analysis to gain that experience. However, marketing and business strategy research has found that there are six basic reasons why some organizations fail. These six "fatal flaws" can help you identify some of t he environmental factors that are particularly important to understand and need either to be addressed or mitigated when developing your marketing strategy:
1. Failure to innovate: no differentiation. Organizations that do not create offers that are superior in some way to those already available usually do not survive very long. Lack of differentiation and the inability to create and defend sustainable competitive advantage is a strategic issue that can be observed in an organization's current strategy relative to its competitive environment.
2. Failure to create value: There is no a large enough market segment that wants a particular offer. Sometimes the current strategy of an organization does not create sufficient customer value to attract customers. Insufficient value creation is a strategic issue that is sometimes observed in an analysis of an organization's current strategy relative to segment profile analysis.
3. Failure to persist over time: insufficent margins, volume, or resources. Often related to the failure to create value, but also sometimes realted to the inability to communicate that value. Some organizations are not able to make sufficient margins or generate sufficient sales volume. Many startup organizations fail because they do not have the financial, technical, human, or management resources to compete effectively over time. This is particularly true of busienss with high fixed costs (those that require significant investment in buildings, equipment, people, technology, or overhead--such as software creation or car manufacturing) because it can take many months or years to recover those initial investments. More established organization can fail because their markets change over time: competition increases, demand decreases, or they can't or don't keep up with changing technology. The inability to compete effectively is an important strategic issue that can be observed in both the internal and external environment.
4. Failure to maintain economic scarcity. Offers are imitable or substitutable. Some organizations fail to protect the value they have created and competitiors are able to better satisfy customer demand with similar offers or substitutes. Organizations that are unable to limit direct competition **by means of intellectual property protection; strong supplier, distributor, or customer relationships; cost structure advantages 9such as economic of scale); switching costs; unique knowledge; greater customization or niche (small market) focus; strong brand name; or somme other market entry barrier**, may not be able to defend their positioning
5. Failure to prevent "appropriation" of value: hold-up or slack. Some organizations get held hostage (held up) by stakeholders in strong bargaining positions, such as strong unions, single source supplier, or key distributors. These stakeholders are able to negotiate terms that erode the profitability of the organization. Hold-up issues might be evident in an industry or competitive analysis. Other organizations are wasteful or inefficient with their resources(slack)--often because the management team does not have sufficient experience in that industry to be effective. This might be evident in an analysis of the organization structure, systems, and culture or the current strategy and performance.
6. Failure to be flexible and adapt: the ability to deal with uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty is being able to anticipate events, but not their timing. For example, a chicken satay vendor could anticipate that at some point in time, despite their best food safety efforts, a customer will get food poisoning from eating t he chicken. Effective organizations create risk management plans, crisis management plans, and have insurance and other "due diligence" interventions to limit the impact of potential risks--but in highly volatile, fast-changing industries (like fashion or biotechnology) this can be difficult to do. But some event can not even be anticipated (such as terrorist attacks, currency devaluations, or stock crashes) and managers need to be capable of adapting to changin circumstances. The degree of uncertainty is often assessed in an industry analysis, and the inability of management to plan or adapt could be an issue in an assessment of an organization's management and systems.


* Marketers use SWOT analysis to help them make strategic and tactical decisions. Internal strengths and external opportunities provide rationale to support a particular course of action. Internal weaknesses and external threats provide reasons why a particular course of action might not be appropriate. Weaknesses and threats, however, are not absolute; both can be addressed or mitigated through marketing strategy. Meal Exchange, for example, is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to motivating post-secondary students to increase their involvement in fighting social problems like hunger (www.mealexchange.com). The organization works with colleges and universities so that students can donate the unused money on their meal cards to local food banks, which could then purchase food for those in need. Differences in college and university policies regarding the redemption of meal cards might be a threat in the external environment of Meal Exchange that could limit expansion plans for the organization. However, this threat might be mitigated or overcome by supporters of the Meal Exchange concpet lobbying college and university administrators to change thier policies so  that they could participate in the Meal Exchange program.
* The key to SWOT analysis is not to get bogged down in analysis paralysis. Firms face hundreds, if not thousands, of internal and external environmental considerations that shape and impact their business. You will want to identify the top six to ten issues that might have the greatest implication for the marketing decisions you have to make. Ask yourself: Does this fact or piece of information have a major implication for a decision I have to make? If not, it's probably not worth documenting in a SWOT analysis. A SWOT summary is a list of the most important issues and their implications, such as those shown below, which is an illustrative example of a SWOT analysis summary for the decision faced by Michel Bendayan at Mega Bloks.

        ### Illustrative SWOT Summary for Mega Bloks ###
        Internal Environment:
        Current Strategy & Performance
                --World market-share leader in preschool segment (S)
                * Ability to leverage international brand name in new markets
                --Weak sales and lack of distribution network (W)
                * Status quo not really an option, market may require unique strategy
        Organization (structure, system, culture)
                --Asia, Australia, and Africa are all under one international marketing director (W)
                * May limit ability to focus on Japan and customize Japanese lines
                --Product innovation culture (S)
                * Ability to compete on innovative new product development
                --Rapid growth in past five years (S,W)
                * Has gained significatn international experience that supports its ability to enter the Japanese market
                * But hard to maintain focus and organizational culture with such growth, high degree of Japanese customization may be difficult to implement
        Resource & Competencies
                --Second largest construction block company in the world (after Lego) (S)
                * Has the experience and resources needed for international expansion
                --3000 employees, 75 to 100 product lines, in 100 countries (S)
                * has the people, expertise, and resources to develop custom product lines
                --Basic product not patentable--Leog had a patent (now expired) (W)
        Management Preferences & Values
                --Standardized products are preferable (inferred) (?)
                * Mega Bloks has not previously customized products for a single country, doing so may create a precedent for a wholesale change in strategy that has significatn cost implications. It might be possible to do it for one country but maybe not for all countries.

        External Environment:
        Macro (General) Environment: PESTO
                --American products are often considered prestige products in Japan (O)
                * May be value in offering North American-style product lines
                --High quality consciousness in Japanese society (T)
                * May need greater control over the supply chain
                --Greater awareness and importance of pop culture (T)
                * May need japanese brand personality
        Consumer Analysis
                --Japanese consumers strongly nationalistic (T)
                * Prefer Japanese look and feel
                --Japanese houses are much smaller than those in North America or even Europe (T)
                * Will likely require different packaging, but also maybe different product lines that enable blocks to be used for many designs


#### Objectives
* **Based on the situational analysis, the business then develops a set of marketing objectives.** These are more specific than the SBU objectives, and achieving the marketing objectives helps an organization achieve the overall SBU objectives. **Marketing objectives normally include one or more sales objectives. After all, without sales, there are no profits, and without profits, there is no business.** Some example of sales objectives are: "To increase sales of our deluxe model toy by 15 percent during the next 12 months","To sell one million toys during the holiday season".
* **If a firm has decided that its growth strategy is to focus on product development--new or improved products for existing customers--it will develop product objectives. Because it is more profitable to retain customers than it is to replace them, firms often set objectives for improvements in quality or service to develop customer loyalty. In the breakfast cereal market, where consumers are more fickle than loyal, firms like Kellogg and General Mills may set objectives for developing new brands to suit the tastes of everyone--children, teens, adults--or they may set goals for a new product to retain customers who are being lured away by a comeptitor's new honey coated, fruit-and-fibre cereal. In other cases, a firm may decide to modify a product by taking advantage of trends, as when Frito-Lay developed its line of "lite" snacks.**
* **In some instances, firms find that their best opportunities for growth are stated in the form of market objectives. These goals can involve entering new markets or increasing product usage in served market, through using either market development strategies (existing product sold to new customers) or diversification strategies (new products for new customers)** Manufacturers of recreational vehicles (motor homes and travel trailers), for example, used a market development strategy in targeting baby boomers. Joining together in a "Go RVing Coalition", they spent US$ 15 million on advertising aimed at this under 50 market in a three-year period".

#### Marketing Strategy: Specifying the Value
Once the marketing and other objectives are developed, the organization develops a marketing strategy aimed at achieving those objectives. As was discussed briefly in Chapter 1, **marketing strategy begins with idetnfiying, profiling, and selecting market segments that will be targeted by the strategy. As will be discussed in mroe detail in Chapter 3, choosing the right market to compete in and the right customer to attract is a critical task for a marketer; a task that combines both art and science.** Once the target market customers have been chosen, marketing strategy focuses on teh positioning issues of **strategic orientation, differentiation, defendability, and brand personality**.
* **Strategic orientation** is a discussion of **how the organization will compete in its chosen market(s)**. This would include a discussion of growth strategies (as per above); customer value creation strategy (Chapter 1); or other strategy concepts that you will learn if you take another marketing course. **Your SWOT analysis is another source of strategy alternatives.** The SWOT strategy Matrix in Figure below illustrates how you can develop strategy alternatives by **considering how to utilize your strengths or address your weaknesses to take advantage of opportunities, and how to address or mitigate threats in the external environment.**



                           Strengths                                            Weaknesses

        Opportunity        SO(1)                                                  WO(2)



        Threats         ST(3)                                                     WT(4)

        * SO(1): utilize strengths to take advantage of opportunity: Utilize strong international experience, international brand name, and economies of scale to take advantage of the opportunity that North American brands are valued to Japan

        * WO(2): Address weakness to take advantage of opportunity: Address this weakness that the product is not patentable, and take advantage of the large Japanese market opportunity by developing a fully customized Japanese product line and brand personality. This will discourage local competition.

        * ST(3): Utilize strength to address or mitigate threats: Utilize product innovation culture to develop a line of flexible use, small package products that address the space limitations of the Japanese market, then utilize international experience and channels to sell this line in Europe

        * ST(4): Address weaknesses to address or mitigate threats: Hire japanese sales representatives to develop their own distribution network in Japan, and utilize this network to address the threat of Japanese retailers being more relationship oriented. Consider partnering in this endeavour with a large retailer to limit strategic exposure with japanese toy manufacturers.





* **Differentiation is how a brand will be known to its customers as being better than competitive brands.** A discussion of differentiation should be specific. It is not meaningful to say that an organization will differentiate itself on quality. **What does that mean in your specific context? For a car it could mean greater reliability, durability, longevity, rust protection, or more comfortable seats, among many other considerations. For a restaurant it could mean better taste, greater variety, better ingredients, faster service, or better ambiance, among other considerations. You need to be specific in identifying what your organization will do better than others.**
* Defendability discusses sources of **sustainable competitive advantage and the systems, competencies, technology, or other resources that enable an organization to defend its chosen positioning.** it is important to understand that the underlying goal of all marketing strategies and plans is to create a competitive advantage for the firm--to take what the company does really well and outperform the competition, thus providing customers with a benefit the competition can not provide. A competitive advantage gives consumers a reason to choose one product over another again and again.
* Finally, brand personality is a discussion of how the intended differentiation will be captured in the creation of brand meaning. Some brands, like the Apple Macintosh, have clear personalities. Imagine that Apple Macintosh was a person and he or she just walk into the room. Describe him or her in as much detail as possible. You can do that quite easily because Apple has spent considerable money developing the mac Guy versus PC Guy series or advertisements (which can be found on its website: www.apple.com). In defining a brand personality we specify what personality we are seeking to support the overall positioning of the brand. This personality gets developed in the marketing mix decisions that we subsequently make.

#### marketing Mix: Create the Value
* As outlined in Chapter 1, a mareting plan then describes the marketing mix decision related to product, price, channel of distribution, and marketing communication. Rationale for these decisions come from your SWOT and other analysis, your understanding of your target market profile, and the marketing theory, principles, and concepts that you will learn from reading this text and attending class.

#### Evaluation and Implementation
* Also as outlined in Chapter 1, **the collective decisions represented in a marketing plan need to be evaluated to determine if the strategy should be implemented.** **Throughout the writting of a marketing plan, rationale is provided for each decision made using your situational analysis, target market profile, and marketing theory, concepts, and principles**. Collectively, however, the set of decisions need to create superior customer value and achieve the organization's objectives, and marketers need to be confident that they have devised the most appropriate strategy given their circumstances. To make the overall recommendation to implement the marketing plan, financial analysis and cost-benefit analysis are required. Financial analysis involves developing projected (pro-forma) financial statements, such as a pro-forma income statement and balance sheet, and sometimes a cash flow statement or a statement of sources and uses of funds. Financial analysis might also include ratio analysis--a comparison of key figures in the financial statements. 
* Cost-benefit analyseis, as the name implies, is an analysis of all the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a partciular course of action. Simple cost-benefit analysis involves a judgment-based (qualitative) assessment of the net benefit (advanatges relate to disadvantages) of one course of action relative to alternatives. More sophisticated cost-benefit analysis involves assigning numerical values to (qualifying) the costs and benefits and then using a decision rule of formulae to calculate the net benefit of each alternative. This more sophisticated approach allows the analyst to assign different levels of importance (weights) to different costs and benefits, but it can sometimes be very difficult to assign a numerical value to some costs and benefits. For example, how might a reasonable numeric value be assigned to the potential loss of life from a poorly designed child's toy, or the potential damage to an ecosystem from batteries that are not recycled?
* Finally, if all of the above-metnioned analyses lead to a positive recommendation to implement a particular strategy, a marketing plan then outlines how the strategy will be implemented, including action plans for the marketing mix elements; responsibilities and time lines (who is going to do what, by when); the budget and how the budget will be allocated by activity; and plans to monitor and measure the results of the strategy implementation, with contingency plans if benchmarks (targets) are not met. Unless already specified as part of the marketing mix, this section of the plan would also specify how exchange relationships will be initiated and managed. This topic will be explored further in Chapter 5 and 6.
* finally, a marketing plan typically includes a set of exhibits that provide details taht support the recommendations made in the body of the plan. These exhibits include the SWOT analysis, detailed market segment profiles, and a pro-forma income statement that shows the forecast sales volume and revenue and identifies the key expenses, as per the proposed marketing budget. Positioning map (described in Chapter 3) are lso often included to illustrate the relative positioning of an organization's brand(s).

# Chapter 3: Market Segmentation and Positioning

## The Concept of Segmentation
* The goal of the marketer is to satisfy needs, but in our complex society, it is naive to assume that everyone's needs are the same. Michael Shekter and his colleagues at Molson know that different types of consumers have different priorities when it comes to buying beer. So when Molson designs and markets its beverages, it needs to consider the different needs that exist in the marketplace. Understanding these needs is especially complex today, because technological and cultural advances have created a condition of market fragmentation. **Market fragmentation occurs when people's diverse interests and backgrounds have divided them into different groups with distinct needs and wants. Because of this diversity, the same product or service will not appeal to everyone.**
* Consider, for example, the effects of fragmentation in the fast-food industry. When a McDonald's hamburger was still a novelty (with under a million sold), people were happy to order just a plain hamburger, fries, and drink. Today's consumers would be very unhappy if salads, children, or wraps disappeared from the menu. But how many menu items do McDonald's, Harvey's, or Pizza Hut need to offer? Why is it that kids insist on a Happy Meal, whereas their parents prefer t o grab a pita at Wendy's or a veggie burger at Harvey's?
* At one time, it was sufficient to divide the sports shoe market into athletes and non-athletes. Today, a walk through any sporting goods store will reveal that the athlete market has fragmented in many directions, and includes shoes designed for jogging, basketball, tennis, cycling, cross-training, and skateboarding. Some manufacturers of athletic footwear geared to young boraders, such as Vans, Airwalk, and DC Shoes, chalked up annual sales gains of 20 to 50 percent in the past few years. Known to their peers as shredders, riders, or skaters, the youth who wear these shoes can be seen riding skateboards down the handrails and steps of city parks, and riding rails or doing jumps on snowboards, stunt bikes, or wakeboards. Over the next few years, sport marketers expect the skateboard and snowboard populations to double and wakeboarders to soar sixfold. To cash in on this trend, PepsiCo Inc.'s Mountain Dew began to feature snowboarding in its advertisements and was rewarded with a hefty increase in sales.
* Instead of trying to sell the same thing to all customers, **marketers often select a target marketing strategy, in which they divide the total market into different segments based on customer characteristics, select one or more segments, and develop products to meet the needs of those specific segments. The five-step process of segmentation, targeting, and positioning is illustrated below.

                1. Select Market: a. Define your market; b. Understand customers: needs and wants; benefits, features, and attributes sought; and purchase and consumption behaviour.

                2. Market Segmentation: a. Identify groups: geographic, behavioural, psychographic, and demographic segmentation; b. Describe (profile) the groups: who, what, when, where, why

                3. Market Targeting: a. Evaluate segment attractiveness: size, growth; strategic, fit, competitive or comparative advantage; level of commpetition, defendability; b. Decide which one(s) to target

                4. Market Positioning: Decide how you want to compete, be differentiated, and be known for value creation in the minds of consumers

                5. Create and Execute Marketing Mix Programs

* Understanding customers will be discussed in Chapter 4,5,6. The creation of marketing mix programs is discussed in Chapter 7 through 13. Our focus here is on segmentation, targeting, and positioning.
* **Segmentation is the process of dividing a larger market into subgroups, where within groups people have fairly homogeneous needs and wants and where between groups people have sufficiently different needs and wants that they would be interested in very different product solutions or marketing programs.** Because consumers have different needs and wants and the same marketing program is unlikely to appeal to all consumers, marketers identify the key groups in a market, choose which group(s) to focus on (target), decide how they want their brand to compete and be known by these consumers (positioning), and design marketing programs (make marketing mix decisions) to create product offers that uniquely appeal to the chosen target groups. There are very few, if any, products with universal appeal. Even for products as popular as cola soft drinks, some consumers prefer Coca-Cola over Pepsi, some prefer Pepsi over Coke, some prefer diet colas, some prefer flavoured colas, and others prefer non-soft drink beverages. Theresa Bergeron, president of Thermohair Inc., has developed a product line of specialty socks made of kid (baby goat) mohair. Not everyone would be interested in a $25 pair of durable, warm, comfortable socks, but people involved in outdoor recreational sports like hiking and camping might be.

## Select and Segmenting a Market
* **One of the challenges in developing a marketing strategy is determining what market you are in and what market you should be segmenting.** For example, should Michael Shekter at Molson be segmenting the beer market, the alcoholic beverage market, or the social beverage market? Kodak redefined itself from being in the film business to being in the imaging business--leading Kodak to venture into new markets. Deciding what "market" you are competing in has significant implications for the segments you might identify. **You must also consider the geographic scope of the market--are you segmenting the beverage market in North America, Canada, or one or more provinces?** The decision about how to define the markets you are competing in **is typically done at the executive (strategic planning) level of an organization**. As an entrepreneur or consultant, you may need to make this decision yourself--**based on your experience, your understanding of the consumer, competitive, and technological environments, and your understanding of the mission, strategic directions, and competencies of your organization.**
* CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING MARKET SEGMENTS: **Before discussing how to segment a market, let's review the criteria for a successful segmentation scheme. There is no right or wrong way to segment a market, but some segmentation schemes are more useful than others for identifying market opportunities and being able to position products that uniquely appeal to a well-defined group of consumers or customers--the term used to describe organizational or business-to-business buyers.**
1. **Members of teh segment must be similar to each other in their product needs and wants such that the same marketing programs (product offers) would be appealing to most members of the group.**
2. **At the same time, consumers in each segment should be sufficiently different from consumers in other segments that different marketing programs or product offers would be appealing to the different segments.** Segment differences need to be **actionable**--that is, **they require different product, pricing, distribution, and/or communication strategies to create aproduct offer that appeal to each segment**. Without real differences in consumer needs and wants, firms might as well use a mass-marketing strategy. For example, it's a waste of time to develop two separate lines of skin care products for working and non-working women, if both segments have the same needs and wants with respect to skin care.
3. **The segment must be large enough now and in the future to warrant targeting**. What is large enough is a judgment call, and usually depends on the size of the company doing the segmentation scheme. large organizations like proctor & Gamble may be interested only in market segments with sales potential in the millions of dollars. A smaller company may be interested in segments with sales potential in teh tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. In considering the B.C market, for example, the Beef Information Centre evaluated the Chinese Canadian community as a possible segment. Chinese Canadians spend more money on food than any other ethnic group, and if just 25 percent of the close to 300,000 Chinese Canadians in British Columbia ate one more beef meal a month, sales of beef in British Columbia would increase by 77,000 kilograms per year. This analysis led the organization to target the Chinese Canadian segment in Vancouver through magazine ads, recipes distributed at grocery stores, and the sponsorship of a Chinese cooking show on TV.
4. The segment must represent a measurable market--that is, people in the segment have purchasing power: the authority, willingness, and ability to make a purchase decision. Children, for example, may not have the authority to make a purchase. Religious or cultural beliefs may impact willingness t o buy(such as beef-based hamburgers in India). Low-income consumers may not have the ability to buy.
5. Finally, the segment must be reachable. Marketers must be able to identify consumers or organizational customers in the segment and communicate the product offer to them in a cost-effective manner. It is easy to select television programs or magazines that will efficiently reach older consumers, consumers with specific levels of education, certain ethnic groups, or residents of major cities, because the media they prefer are easy to identify. It is unlikely, however, that marketing communications can reach only lef-handed blond people with tattoos who listen to hip-hop. Therefore, it may no make sense to target that segment

## The Process of Segmentation
* Segmentation is the central tenet of cornerstone of marketing strategy. Not all consumers of business market customers want the same things, and marketers have to decide which consumers or customers they are going to focus on to create an appealing product-offer. Several segmentation variables, or bases for segmentation, can be used to group consumers into actionable segments. For example, consider the sports shoe industry. Some sports, such as running, are more popular in some provinces than others, so marketers consider geography. Not everyone is willing or able to pay $150 for the latest running shoe, so marketers consider disposable and discretionary income. Men may be more likely to participate in some sports, such as basketball, whereas women may be more likely than men to want the latest aerobic styles, so marketers also consider gender. Not all age groups are going to be equally interested in buying specialized athletic shoes, and some kids may be more inclined to "extreme" sports than others. As this example shoes, the larger consumer "pie" can be sliced into smaller pieces in a number of ways, **including geographic, demographic, psychological, and behavioural difference**. These segmentation variables are used to identify the groups, and then create descriptions or profiles of the groups. So, just how do marketers segment a population? The process is similar for organizational (business-to-business) markets, and will discuss some of the difference shortly.

### Behavioural Segmentation
* Savvy marketers realize that if the objective is to create groups that want very different product offers, it makes sense to try to group them by the similarity of their needs, wants, and preferences, the benefits they seek, the features and attributes they desire, or their purchasing or consumption behaviour. This approach to segmentation is called behavioural segmentation, and marketers such as Palm and McDonald's have found it useful place to start because it identifies groups that require distinct marketing programs. Recent research by Digital Consumer Projects in New York suggests that online individual behaviour matters more than the demographics of an individual, finding seven behavioural segments that include "surfers", "loiterers", and "quickies".
* Behavioural segmentation divides consumers on the basis of how they act toward, feel about, or use a product or service. **Benefit segmentation, or value segmentation, is a powerful behavioural segmentation appraoch where consumers are grouped by the benefits they seek in a product category**. For example, Peachtree Network, a company that operated online grocery stores across Canada, originally segmented its market into three benefit segments: busy people, people with mobility difficulties, and people who liked and were motivated to use the technology behind the service. In many industries, consumers seek different types of benefits from products and can be grouped accordingly. For example, the following benefit-based groups might be identified (among others) as restaurant industry segments: convenience seekers, fun seekers, health-oriented, fine-dining oriented, family-oriented, image- or status- oriented, or culture seekers. Each of us may fall into more than one of these benefit-seeking categories at different times or in different contexts, but restauratn owners know that different consumers seek different benefits from a restaurant and select restaurants based on the benefits they wish to receive at a particular time. That is why restaurants are usually clearly positioned to appeal to one or more of these benefit segment groups. Think of all the restaurants you know: What benefit(s) do they primarily focus on delivering? The advantage of segmenting by benefits is that the resulting groups are usually seeking very different product solution, which makes the segmentation scheme very actionable in terms of designing appropriate marketing program.
* Another comkmon approach to behavioural segmentation is **product usage segmentation**. In this approach, **groups are identified based on how they use a product or how much they use a product.** Baking soda, for example, is marketered to a variety of en-use segments, including deodorizing fridges, sinks, or rugs; cooking; and teeth brushing. Airlines often identify consumer and business traveller segments, which is a proxy for describing the frequency of product use (light users versus heavy users) and how they use the service. Many marketers (particularly those in business-to-business markets) abide by a rule of thumb called the 80/20 rule: 20 percent of purchasers account for 80% of the product's sales (this ratio is just an approximation). **Therefore, it often makes more sense to focus on the smaller number of people who are beavy users of a product rather than on the larger number who are just casual users.** Kraft Foods began an advertising campaign to remind its core users to not "skip the zip" after its research showed that, indeed, 20 percent of households account for 80 percent of the usage of Miracle Whip. These heavy users consume about 8 kilograms of Miracle Whip a year!
* While the 80/20 rule still generally holds in the marjority of situations, the Internet's ability to offer an unlimited choice of goods to billions of people is starting to change how marketers think about segmentation. **A new approach called the long tail is turning traditional thinking about the virtues of selling in high volume on its head. The basic idea is that we no longer need to rely solely on the big hits (like blockbuster movies or bestselling books) to find profits. Companies can also make money by selling small amounts of items that only a few people want--if they sell enough different items.** For example, Amazon.com maintains an inventory of 3.7 million books compared to the 100,000 or so you'll find at a Chapters retail store. Most of these will sell only a few thousand copies (if that), but the 3.6 million books that Chapters doesn't carry make up a quarter of Amazon's revenue! Similarly, about a fifth of the videos Netflix delivers to its customers are older or obscure titles that Blockbuster does not stock. Other examples of long tail include successful microbreweries and TV channels that make money on reruns of old shows.
* **Some marketers find it useful to divide the market into users and non-users of a good or service so that they can reward current users (as Air Canada does with frequent flyer miles) or try to win over new ones.** However, non-users are often not clearly identifieable and reachable, thus failing to satisfy the fifth criterion for identifying market segment outlined above. And current users may not be a very homogeneous group, which is the first criterion, and **they may not reflect the users desired by the marketing organization.**
* **Another way to segment a market based on behaviour is to look at usuage occasions, or the context in which consumers use the product most. Many products are associated with specific occasions, including time of day and holidays, whether for a business function or casual situation. Greeting cards, for example, are a product associated with specific occasions. Carlton cards, Canada's leading greeting card marketer, experiences peak demand related to four special occasions: Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Easter. In addtion to meeting the demand for these occasions with specialized cards, advertising, and in-store promotions, Carlton engages in marketing efforts designed to encourage the giving of cards on other occasions, such as Earth Day.** Similarly, ski resorts like Mont Tremblant, which experience heavy demand during vacation periods, might offer great bargains during the off-season to tempt vacationers who would otherwise jsut visit the resort during Christmas vacation.
* Being strongly associated with an occasion can be a mixed blessing for a product. **On the one hand, sales can be almost guranteed at that time (think about how many people cook a whole turkey on Thanskgiving); on the other hand, a product can become locked into an occasion (few people cook whole turkeys as a standard menu item). For the past 10 years, Ocean Spray has worked hard to expand cranberry consumption beyond the holiday seaon, introducing new cranberry foods like Craisin Sweetened Dried Cranberries, spritzers, and cranberry-based beverages. Now it's trying to increase consumption frequncy by communicating the health benefits of its products and encouraging consumers to take the Ocean Spray Cranberry Cocktail "One Glass A Day Challenge".**

### Segmenting by Psychographics
* Consumers and customers often **make purchase decisions that reflect or support their attitudes, values, interests, opinions, emotions, personality, and lifestyles**. Collectively these concepts are discussed further in Chapter 5. Psychographic segmentation group consumers by these and other variables related to an individual's psychology, mental state, or self and is concerned with t he motivation for consumers to buy products. As we will se in Chapter 5, marketers not only seek to understand **how consumers behave but also how they think and feel about products, what motivates them, how they learn, and how they make purchase decision.**
* Grouping consumers by their psychological orientation to a purchase often results in a useful segmentation scheme that meets the criteria below, since difference in these psychological considerations usually reflect differences in needs and wants and are precursors to purchase and consumption behaviour. For example, Covenant House, a charitable organization that helps homeless people, **recognized that donors care more about the homeless than non-donors care more about the homeless than non-donors do, and believe their donations will make a difference**. With this understanding, Taxi Advertising and Design of Toronto developed a series of highly effective (and award-winning) campaign elements to increase the number of people who care about the homeless, thus increasing the pool of potential donors. One showed black and white images of homeless people sitting alone on the ground in a transit shelter, replaced by images of young children in the same position, with the tag line, "how old do they have to be before you give a damn?" 

        * Similar Enough within the group
        * Different Enough Between the Groups
        * Large Enough
        * Measurable market
        * Reachable

* Lifestyles are a powerful segmentation variable because they capture a number of behavioural, psychographic, and demographic characteristics that reflect how different groups of people live, what they care about, and how they behave. Think about your high-school experience. Were there cliques or groups of students like Jocks, Nerds, Preppies, Stoners, and other who hung out together, dressed similarly, had similar attitude and values, and behave similarly? You could describe each of those groups in some detail. That's what marketers do. Some advertising agencies and manufacturers develop their own psychographic classifications of consumers, identifying lifestyle segments like Yuppies (young urban professionals), Dinks (dual income, no kids), Shredders (boarders), Granolas (early, environmentally concerned, peaceniks), Metrosexual (urban heterosexual males who are sensitive, well educated, and in t ouch with their feminine side), and others. **Products are communicated to people in these segments by showing how the brand supports or is consistent with a particular lifestyle.** Beer marketers like Molson, for example, **often use lifestyle advertising to demonstrate what your life (or at least social life) would be like if you adopted their particular brand. Similarly, car marketers like Toyota, Mazda, Volvo, Saturn, and Mercedes try to show you a lifestyle that they suggest could be yours if you drive their cars.** The Ford Fusion ad relateds to the Fusion brand to a young, high-energy lifestyle. Web-based services like GeoCities allow people to sort themselves into lifestyle communities based on specific shared interests. Online marketers can then target these specific lifestyle groups. Apple's use of lifestyle segmentation has been particularly effective. Apple positions Mac and iPods as being for people with a young, hip, unconventional outlook on life.
* Other marketers choose to subscribe to larger services that divide the population into segments and sell pieces of this informaiton to clients for specific strategic applications. The most well known of these system is **VALS (Values and Lifestyles)**, developed by SRI International. The original VALS system was based on social values and lifestyles. Today VALS2 is based on psychological traits that correlate with consumers behaviour. It divides people into eight groups based on both psychological characteristics, such as willingness to take risks, and "resources", which include such factors as income, education, energy levels, and eagerness to buy. As shown below, three primary consumer motivations are key to the system: ideals, achievement, and self-expression. **Consumers who are motivated primarily by ideals are guided by knowledge and principlels. Consumers who are motivated primarily by achievement look for goods and services that demonstrate success to their peers. Consumers who are motivated primarily by self-expression desire social or physical activity, variety, and risk.** VALS2 helps match products to particular types of people. For example, VALS2 survey data show that 12 percent of North American adults are Experiencers, who tend to be thirll seekers. VAL2 help Isuzu market its Rodeo sport-utility vehicle by repositioning it to Experiencers, many of whom believe it is fun to break rules (in ways that do not endanger others). The company and its advertising agency repositioned the car as a vehicle that lets a driver break the rules by going off road, using images like kids jumping into mud puddles or purposefully colouring outside the lines to illustrate "rule breaking" Isuzu sales increased significantly after this campaign.
* Marketing researchers can integrate the VALS2 questionaire into custom surveys to identify VALS2 types of repsondents and to correlate their preferences and other behavior with their type. You can find out your VALS2 type by taking their online survey at **www.sric-bi.com**
* VALS is one of the most comprehensive psychographic system available, but because its conslusions are based on residents of the United States, many Canadian firms prefer to use Canadian psychographic systems, such as the one developed by the Environics Research Group (www.environics.net). SKIM

### Segmneting by Demographics
* Demographics are vital for identifying the best potential customers for a product or service because objective cahracteristics like a person's sex or age are (usually) easy to identify and information about the demographics of a consumer market are easily obtained from government sources like Statistics Canada. Demographics are extremely useful in the development of profiles or description of market segment because demographic variables help identify people in segments so that they can be reached with a marketer's communication strategy. **Communications media publish demographic information about their viewers, listeners, or readers to help marketers decide which media are best for reaching which audiences.**
* However, with a few notable exceptions, demographic variables like age, sex, income, family structure, social class, ethnicity, and education **do not usually provide a good starting point or main basis for segmentation because demographic-based segmentation schemes usually do not meet the criterion that the people within each group are similar enough that the same marketing programs (product offers) would be appealing to most members of that group (first criterion)**. For example, one might be tempted to segment the music market by age, suggesting that teenagers may listen to differnt music than people in their twenties, forties, or sixties. While teenagers may be more likely than other age groups to listen to grunge or hip-hop music, not all teens like and listen to this style of music, and there are people in their twentites, thirties, forties, and perhaps even older, who do. By creating age segments we are suggesting that most people in a particular age category have similar needs, wants, preferences, and buying behaviour with respect to music and that they would likely purchase the same or similarly positioned artists or brands, which are different from the artists or brands that consumers in other segments would liekly purchase. If you thought this were true, then age would be an appropriate basis for segmenting the music market. **However, it might make more sense to segment the music market by psychographic variable, such as values, attitudes, interests, opinions, or lifestyles, and then use age and other demographic variables to describe each of the psychographic groups created. This is subtle but important point for creating useful segmentation schemes--demographics are extremely useful for describing market segments and for directing communication messages, but are generally limited as the primary basis for segmentation.**
* *There are some notable exceptions where demographic variables are **related to differences in needs, wants, preferences, and purchase behaviour, and it would make sense to use these variables as the main basis for segmentation***
* **Sex** It makes sense to segment the clothing, fashion, footwear, or fragrance industries by sex, for example, because phsiological and socialization differences between men and women can result in different needs, wants, and preferences. However, men and women may also seek different benefits, features, or attributes, so, in many cases, starting with benefit segmentation would result in a similar segmentation scheme as if starting with sex. **Socialization by sex starts at a very early age and markets need to be responsive to consumer preferences; even diapers come in pink for girls and blue for boys.** As proof that consumers take these differences seriously, market researcher report that most parents refuse to put male infants in pink diapers. Ford Canada recognizes that women and men may have different needs when it comes to purchasing and servicing cars and trucks, which is why the company is now focusing efforts on trying to better understand and serve the needs of Canadian women. Volvo has created a concept car designed by women for women. Similarly, companies such as Home Depot Canada, Marriott Hotels, and Mr. Lube, which have traditionally focused on marketing to men, have started developing products and messages specifically targeting Canadian women. The publisher of What magazine focus on a segment of co-gender lifestyles of Canadian youth, but Fuel, a new entry by Youth Culture (which also publishes Verve for girls), is focused on male teens--its research finding that boys and girls liked and wanted to learn and read about different things. Its biggest hurdle has been convincing advertisers that boys shop, and develop brand loyalty, but for different products than girls. 
* **Age** Consumers in different age groups have very different needs and wants with respect to product categories. Members of a generation tend to share the same outlook and spending priorities, **and these outlooks and priorities change as people age (what you spend your discretionary money on is likely different from what your parents spend their discretionary money on).** However, unless brands specifically relfect these differences in product category needs and wants (such as we saw with What and Fuel magazines), age is less useful for identifying differences in brand preferences than for identifying differences in product category preferences.
* Canadian demographer David Foot has identified several segments of Canadian consumers based on age. These include members of the Baby Boom (those people born in 1947--1966), the Baby Bust (generation x; those born in 1980-1979), the Baby Boom Echo (generation Y; those born in 1980-1995), and Milennium Buster (those born in 1996-2010). While each of these groups of consumers presents needs that some marketers are interested in, **the largest demographic segment in Canada, the baby boomers, accounts for about one-third of the Canadian population and is, therefore, a segment of prime importance to many marketers.** Several companies have achieved success by monitoring the changing needs of this group of consumers. SKIM about baby boomer
* The echo boom (generation Y) comprises the children of the baby boomers. The largest segment of the echo boom are now teens and young adults, who also represent a lucrative group of consumers. The youth market in Canada is estimated to be worth over $13.5 billion, and teens are the second fastest growing segment in Canada.
* They are the first generation to grow up onlin and are more ethnically diverse than earlier generations. These consumers tend to spend their money on items such as clothing, personal grooming, entertainment, sports, and eating out. Montreal-based La Senza has successfully targeted teen and tween (aged 8-14) girls with La Senza Girl store, and banks such as the Royal Band and CIBC have savings programs and debit cards specifically aimed at kids. **VanCity Credit Union recently targeted youth with a banking service "Not for the majority, offering free banking service to anyone under the age of 25. The campaign is backed with a combination of street marketing, web promotions, contests, special events, and a text messaging campaign targeting 5000 youth in Vancouver who had been given cellphones by research company Digital Youth, in exchange for volunteering to receive promotional messages and advertising.**
* The older part of the echo boom, those people born in the early- to mid- 1980, are now in college and universities, or have joined the workforce, and are starting to make major purchases on their own. This college-age group is an important target group for companies like DirectProtect, which sells insurance to students, and brewers such as Moosehead, Molson, and Labatt, who realize that many of the heavy users of their product can be found on campus across Canada.
* In between the baby boomers and the echo boomers are Generation Xers, sometimes labelled busters. **Many of these people have a cynical attitude toward marketing, and most don't have the spending power of boomers or even echo boomers.** However, because baby boomers have taken and held on to the top jobs in the country, **Generation Xers have had to be much more entrepreneurial.** They have been responsible for upwards of 70 percent of the new startup business in North America, As one industry expert observed, today's Gen Xer is both values oriented and value oriented--and this generation is really about settling down. SKIP for teen and parent of baby boomers
* **FAMILY STRUCTURE** Because family needs and expenditures change over time, one way to segment consumers is to consider the stage of the family life cycle they occupy (this will be discussed further in chapter 5). Not suprisingly, consumers in different life cycle segments (such as teens, young adults, married with children, empty nesters) are unlikely to need the same products, or at least in the same quantities. For example, many food companies cater to the needs of people who live alone by providing single-portion forzen and prepared foods, but also offer "jumbo" packs for those people who live in larger households.
* As we age and move into new life situations, different product categories ascend and descend in importance to us. **Young singles and newlyweds are the most likely to exercise, to go to bars, concerts, and movies, and to consume alcohol.** Young families are heavy users of disposable diapers and toys and games for children. They are also interested in household appliances, furniture, and such vehicles as minivans. Older couples and singles are more likely to use maintenance services, and older people are a prime market for retirement communities and golf products. **Condominiums that are built in Candian cities are often designed with different family structures in mind. Some are built in Candian cities are often designed with different family structures in mind. Some target single divorced men and women; other go after young families and include amenities such as on-site day care; and still others target vacation home buyers.** Canadian department stores also consider family life cycle by specifically targeting brides- and groom-to-be with weding registry services
* **INCOME AND SOCIAL CLASS** *The distribution of wealth is of great interest to marketers, because it determines which groups have the greatest buying power.* Many marketers are interested in capturing the hearts and wallets of high-income consumers. In Canada, the average family income is about **$58,000**, but 13.5 percent of the population has a household income above $100,000. These high-income consumers are a good target market for such luxury products as expensive juewellery, as well as financial services of brokers and investment products. The Wealthy Boomer Inc. is a Canadian company that targets high-income baby boom consumers with its magazine, The Wealthy Boomer. **At the same time, other marketers target average- and low-income consumers--the majority of Candian consumers.** The Hudson's Bay Company successfully target these income groups with its Bay and Zellers department stores.
* **ETHNICITY** As will be discussed further in Chapter 5, many Canadian marketers are adopting a multicultural approach to their marketing activities in recognition of the ethnic diversity of the Canadian population. Ethnicity can have a strong impact on a consumer's preferences for products and services, such as magazines or television shows, foods, apparel, and choice of leisure activities.
* SKIM for French and Aboriginal consumers. SKIM for Chinese. In summary, just use their language in advertising and advertise at the said language's channel
* **GEOGRAPHY** People's preferences for products and services often depend on which region of the country they live in. **For example, a recent study of how upper-income people across Canada spend their money showeded significant regional differences.** Compared to the average Candian, upper-income people living in Edmonton were more likely to spend their money on skiwear and snowmobile suits, those in Saskatoon were more likely to purchase home exercise equipment, those in Montreal were more likely to purchase leather and fur coats and jackets, those in Halifax were more likely to purchase art goods and decorative ware, those in St. John's were more likely to buy snow blowers, and those in the north were more likely to purchase outboard motor boats. Similarly, a study of snacking behaviour found that Maritimers consume more potato chips than consuemrs in other regions (almost double the national average), and Quebec consumers eat less than half of the average amount of corn chips that consumers in other regions do.
* **Recognition of these kinds of regional differences can lead marketers to focus efforts on one or more regions, or to have different marketing strategies in different regions. When marketers want to segment regional markets even more precisely, they sometimes combine geography with demographics by using a technique called geodemography. A basic assumption of geodemography is that "birds of a feather flock together". People who live near one another share similar characteristics. Sophisticated statistical techniques identify geographic areas that share the same preferences for household items, magazines, and other products. This allows marketers to construct segments consisting of households with a common pattern of preferences, so that a company can home in on those customers who are most likely to be interested in specific offerings--in some cases so precisely that families living on one block will be included in a segment whereas those on the next block will not.
* **One Canadian geodemographic system, PSYTE, is a large database developed by Compusearch Micromarketing Data and Systems. This system classifies Canadian consumers into 60 clusters, based on postal code and demographic information. The resulting clusters include Boomers and Teens, Conservative Homebodies, Young City Singles, Brie and Chablis, and Suburban Nesters.** The PSYTE system is used by Canada Post in its GeoPost Plus program, which allows marketers to target direct mail to clusters of consumers that match their target segment. For example, the Boomers and Teens segment is described as "late middle-aged consumers who are university and college educated with children over the age of six. Mostly double income families who live in their own homes". The cluster Young City Singles are "young singles and some couples who rent predominantly newer, downtown apartments and other dwellings". Using a geodemographic system like GeoPost Plus, a marketer of home improvement products like outdoor paint and fencing can identify precisely which postal codes will be the best prospects for direct mail advertising for their product, while avoiding other postal codes where resident aren't likely to be interested.

## SEGMENTING BUSINESS MARKETS
* We've reviewed the segmentation variables marketers use to divide up the consumer market, but how about all the business-to-business or industrial marketers? Segmentation also helps them to divide up business and organizational customers. Though the specfic variables may differ, the underlying logic of dividing the larger market into manageable pieces that share relevant characteristics is the same. **Although industrial markets tend to be smaller (in numbers of customers) and more concentrated, it is still important to segment these markets because no company has unlimited resources for developing and selling products and segmentation enables these companies to focus on thh best opportunities and develop products that uniquely meet the needs of the customers.**

#### Company-Specific Behaviour or Characteristics
* Just as it is fruitful to consider the behaviour of individual consumers when devising a segmentation scheme, it is fruitful to consider how busiensses and other organizations behave when devising segmentation schemes for industrial or business-to-business segmentation. Organizational buying behaviour will be the focus of Chapter 6. For now, it is important to recognize that organizations, through the people within them, act and behave in ways that are both similar to and different from consumers, and that the way they behave and operate is influenced by the types of products and services they both sell and needs. **Consequently, one way to segment organizations is by the unique way each operates.**
* **Organization buying and consumption behaivour is influenced by the production technology used; the type of purchases made; the busienss customer's degree of technical, financial, or operations expertise; how they make purchase decisions and who is involved in those decisions; whether the prospect is a current user or non-user of the product; and the frequency or size of the transactions.** These operating variables are all useful bases of segmentation. For example, Grand & Toy recognized the differences in the buying behaviour of large and small businesses when it launched the Stockroom, and Internet-based office supplies store that targets small businesses. While the Grand & Toy website is geared to the needs of large bujsinesses (offering benefits like large volume discounts), The Stockroom site caters to small business with its products and pricing policies. The general manager of The Stockroom describes the company's approach this way: "...we felt it was important to take a very aggressive, focus stance, purely aimed at the small business segment"
* **Busienss marketers also must consider how different customers will use their products or services. They must focus on identifying different end-use applications for these offerings. The personal computer industry is a good example of how firms can segment a market based on end use. Some major PC manufacturers, such as Dell, have divided the market into four segments: corporate, small business, government, and home or home office--each with its own computer-use profile. IBM segments its mainframe market into user "verticals"; different applications (such as health care or manufacturing) ofr which the mainframe computers might be used.**

### Industrial Psychographics
* Being concerned with psychology, thinking, feeling, and other mental states, the concept of psychographics relates only indirectly to organizations, but it does relate to the people who run and work in those organizations. Industrial psychographics, the application of psychographics to the business-to-business context, has mainly been applied to understanding buyers (purchasing agents or multiple people in a buying centre) to help salespeople better understand their one-on-one relationships with clients. It may also be fruitful to segment business markets by the mission, goals, and values of an organization and its management team, since purchase and consumption decisions and behaviours are likely to be consistent with those missions, goals, and values. This is the thinking of Steve Munden, director of research at the Toronto-based marketing firm Warrillow and Co. Munden is developing a psychographic profile of Generation Xers who own small- and medium-sized businesses. These entrepreneurs are people in their mid twenties to thirties who are increasingly leaving the workforce to take control of their lives and find financial independence. Munden thinks a psychographic profile of these entrepreneurs will help his client better target these business organizations--as the beliefs, values, and orientation of these entrepreneurs are expected to play a large role in their company's purchase decision
* **ORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS** **Demographic data help business marketers understand the needs and characteristics of their potential customers. For example, a manufacturer of work uniforms needs to know which industries currently provide uniforms for employees. For each industry that uses uniforms, from chemical processing to pest control, a marketer needs to know how many companies are potential customers, the number of employees in each company, what types of uniforms are needed, and so on.** That information enables the manufacturer to offer its services to the prospects that are most likely to be interested in outfitting employees in its protective clothing. 
* Many industries use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which will be further discussed in Chapter 6, to obtain information about the size and number of companies operating in a particular industry. Other government information sources, such as Statistics Canada and Strategis (www.strategis.gc.ca), provide valuable business demographic information.

## DEVELOPING PROFILES  
* Once marketers have divided a market into segments that meet the criteria of segmentation, the next task is to develop a brief **segment profile**, or description of each segment, with sufficient depth to be able to understand the segment so that it can be evaluated and either be targeted or rejected.
* One useful tempalte for developing these profiles is illustrated below, A rich profile would normally include a description of **1) who is the segment (using demographics, psychographics, and geographic variables); 2) what people or organizations in this segment want (benefits, features, and attributes) and why (needs, motivations); 3) when and where they expect to buy and use the product; 4) how they typically buy the product (such as purchase decision process, influences, sources of information, media preferences); or 5) how they typically use the product (consumption behaviour).** In addition, marketers try to estimate the size of each segment and its expected growth rate. An example of the application of this framework can be found in Chapter 14. For the purposes of selecting market segment to target, these profiles are usually created based on experience and judgment. **Sophisticated marketers, however, use market research and anlytic tools such as cluster analysis to verify profile assumption or to more scientifically identify the segments and their characteristics. This is discussed further in Appendix 4A.** The profiles of the segment(s) chosen for targeting (see below) are developed in much more detail and **provide, in part, the basis for making marketing mix decisions**.

        Who are they?
        * What are their demographic characteristics?
        * What are their psychographic characteristics?
        * What are geodemographic characteristics?
        * How price sensitive are they?

        What do they want and why?
        * What are the benefits, features, attributes, or characteristics sought by consumers in this segments?
        * What do they need and want?
        * What motivates the purchase and consumption decision?

        When do they buy and use it?
        * What triggers t he purchase decision?
        * What is the context in which they buy the product?
        * how often do they buy the product?
        * What time of day, part of the week, or month, or year is it purchased?
        * What time of day, part of the week, or month, or year is it used or consumed?

        Where do they buy and use it?
        * What stores or other distribution channels do they use?
        * Where are they when they use the product?

        How do they buy and use it?
        * How do they decide what to buy? (decision-making process used)
        * What or who influences the purchase decision?
        * Is it a thinking (cognitive) or feeling (emotional) decision?
        * Is it high involvement (important or risky) decision or a low involvement (not important or risky)?
        * How do they use or consume the product?
        * how much of it do they use?

        Segment Size
        * What is the market potential?
        * What is the expected growth rate of the segment?


### Market Targeting
* Once marketers have divided a market into actionable segments and developed a brief profile of each segment, they need to evaluate the attractiveness of each potential segment and decide which one or more of these groups they will target with marketing programs. The consumer or customer group(s) selected are the firm's **target market(s)**.
* SoyaWorld, a Canadian soy beverage marketer, has attained 60 percent of the dairy alternative market by carefully considering specific target markets. Soy beverages make up the fastest growing beverage category in Canada, and SoyaWorld has identified three main targets in the total market: the mainstream dairy market, the Asian market, and the organic market. For the mainstream dairy segment, SoyaWorld introduced So Good, a soy beverage with an improved taste that comes in several flavours. Since the product was being promoted as an alternative to milk, So Good was packaged to look like milk and was placed in the dairy cases of major supermarkets. Billboards, TV, and magazine ads, were all used to reach the mainstream market. SoyaWorld targets Asian consumers with its Sunrise brand, a product that has a more traditional soy beverage, and Rice Choice, a fortified rice beverage. To reach the organic and Asian segments, the SoyaWorld products are distributed through specialty retailers, such as Chinese grocery stores and health food stores, in addition to selected larger grocery stores. In this section, we'll review how marketers like SoyaWorld assess the customer groups in teh market, and what selection strategies they use for effective targeting.

### Target Market Selection
* There are three basic criteria for deciding which market segments are attractive to an organization: **segment size and growth, the external decision environment, and the internal decision environment.

1. Segment Size and Growth. When choosing market segments to target, one consideratoin is the size and growth of the segment. The segment must be "the right size"--large enough to be profitable now and in the future, but small enough that an organization can compete effectively in it. It is a lot easier to compete in a high growth segment than in a low or declining growth segment because in a high growth segment, new customers do not have to be taken away from existing competitors.
2. External Environment. While segment size and growth is aprt of the external environment, marketers tend to give that issue speical attention because of its strategic importance. There are, however, other external environment considerations when choosing market segment. **One is the level of competition.** Large and high growth segments are highly attractive to other competitors and a smaller organization may not have the resources to compete effectively against them. **It may make sense for smaller companies , with more limited resources, to focus on smaller segments (market niches) and not compete directly with larger competitors. This was the strategy of Sun Microsystems when it focused on the computer segment of engineering and scentific workstations in the early 1990s. As a small company it was able to dominate the overall computer market. Similarly, when Toyota introduced the Echo subcompact car into the Canadian market, the target segment was described demographically as "60/40 male/female, 40% married, median age 32, 48% university educated with an average household income $42,000." In addition, the segment displayed the following psychographic traits: idealistic, experimental, independent, educated, urban, and not brand loyal. This is like a fairly small segment, even on a national level, and it suggests that even large companies may decide to focus on small segments if they can create unique value there better than competitors can. I t may be more profitable to be a "big fish in a small pond", and being that "big fish" may discourage other competitors from entering the market segment.
* Related to the extent and level of competition is the industry structure. A local monopoly (or near monopoly) like Rogers Cable may choose to focus on large, less well-defined segments because there are no direct competitors (other than satelite TV services) focusing their strateiges on more narrow segments. Where there is extensive competition, dfifferent competitors will focus on increasingly narrow market segments, making it difficult for others to compete effectively in multiple segments.
* A segment with many substitute products may limit the price and hence profits in that segment. Segments where there are few buyers or buyers with otherwise strong bargaining position might ablso be unattractive as t hese buyers can keep prices down and play one supplier off another. Segments with strong suppliers (large, concentrated, or with few competitors or substitutes) may similarly be unattractive. Finally, as we will see in Chapter 8 (Product Management), segment attractiveness is also related to the stage of the product life cycle--where mature and declining markets are less attractive than new and growing ones.
3. Internal environment. The marketer must also be able to **adequately serve the needs of the segment and have the expertise and resources to do so better than the competition**. Some years ago, Exxon made the mistake of trying to enter the oofice product business, a growing segment. The company's expertise at selling petroleum products did not transfer to copying machines, and effort was unsuccessful. Four Season Hotels, on the other hand, was recently able to transfer its expertise in exceptional accommodation services aimed at a tightly defined, luxury lifestyle audience to an entirely new market sector, residential properties. The attractiveness of a segment depends on a company's ability to create value in that segment and defend their strategy in that segment. This requries an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the organization relative to the needs of the consumers and competition in that segment.

### TARGETING STRATEGY

##### Undifferentiated Marketing
* A company like Walmart that selects an **undifferentiated (or mass) targeting strategy** is appealing to a broad spectrum of people. If successul, this type of operation can be very efficient, especially because production, research, and promotion costs benefit from economies scale--it's cheaper to develop one product or one advertising campaign than to choose several targets and create separate products or messages for each. But the company must be willing to bet that people have similar needs, or that any difference among them will be so trivial that they will not matter, so that the same product and message will appeal to many customers. This is the approach Henry Ford used in offering the Model-T Ford--"in any color, so long as it was black". Today it is difficult to create a single product or offering that has very broad appeal. Consumers expect choices, there are many distribution channels from which to purchase products, and there are many focused-communication outlets that let marketers cost-effectively communicate to increasingly narrow target markets. **Companies with new-to-the-world innovations are the ones that most commonly practice undifferentiated marketing, but segments in these markets quickly develop as competitors enter these markets with differentiated products and consumers become more knowledgeable and demanding about the product category**j. When competitors are using a differentiated strategy it makes it difficult for the original innovator to continue using an undifferentiated strategy.

##### Differentiated Marketing
A company that chooses a differentiated targeting strategy develops one or more products for each of several distinct customer groups and make sure these offerings are kept separate in the marketplace. A differentiated strategy is called for when consumers are choosing among well-known brands, when each has a distinctive image in the marketplace, and when it's possible to identify one or more segments that have distinct needs for different types of product. Most large organizations follow a differentiation strategy. The cosmetics company L'Oreal uses a differentiated targeting strategy. The company has the resources to offer several product lines at a variety of prices. It targets the luxury market with such brands as Lancome and Helena Rubinstein, whereas less expensive offering such as Elseve and L'Oreal target large department stores and discounters. Even within product lines, Procter & Gamble has multiple laundry detergent products focused on different laundry detergent segments.

##### Concentrated Marketing
* When a firm focuses its efforts on offering one or more products to a single segment, it is using a concentrated targeting strategy. A concentrated strategy is often useful for smaller firms that do not have the resources or the desire to be all things to all people. For example, the cosmetic company Hard Candy, markets its funky line of nail polish and other products only to twentysommething women (or to those who wish they still were). Niche marketing is a type of concentrated targeting strategy where the market segment choice is relatively small. Jones Soda, for example, focuses on the alternative soft drink niche by offering a series of soft drink products for people who want a premium beverage that stands out, is individualized, expresses personality, and makes a fashion statement. **Niche marketing is becoming the norm in many markets as it allows many competitors to each make unique appeals and be the product of choice for some group of consumers**

##### Customized Marketing
**Ideally, marketers should be able to define segments so precisely that they can offer products and services that exactly meet the needs of every individual or firm.** **Custom marketing strategy, also called micro-marketing strategy, is when specific products and the messages about them are tailored to individual customers or locations. An individualized strategy is often used in business markets by commpanies, such as aircraft manfacturer Bombardier, to make sure the individual needs of its few customers who spend a lot of money are met. **In consumer markets, this level of concentration shows up in personal or professional services, by doctors, lawyers, and hair stylists, for example. In most consumer markets, individualized marketing strategies are neither practical nor possible when products are mass-produced. However, advances in technology, coupled with the new emphasis on building solid relationship with customers, have enabled mass customization. Clothing manfacturers like Levi Strauss and the high-end German clothier Engelhorn, for example, use digital imaging technology to do body scans of customers that enable the creation of perfectly fitting jeans, swimwear, or other clothing products. Calgary-based Critical Mass has worked with Nike to develop NIKEiD, an interactive part of the Nike website where consumers can design and purchase their own running shoes. Dell uses the Internet to provide custom-built computer; customers choose among various options and Dell makes the computer to order. Individualized communication has also been enabled by Internet and email technologies. Online retailers, such as HMV.com, for example, are able to send customized messages to user regarding the status of their orders, upcoming promotions that may be of interest based on the product they have bought in the past, and announcements, of new releases. 

## POSITIONING
* The final, **crucial stage of the target marketing process is providing consumers in a targeted market segment with a product or service that meets their unique needs and expectations. Positioning means developing a marketing strategy that clearly differentiates a firm from its competitors along key dimensions of value that are important to target consuemrs or customers**. When describing a positioning strategy, **marketers often focus on four elements: differentiation, strategic orientation, defendability, and brand personality.**
* Differentiation relates to how your offer will be different from, or better than, competitive offerings, at least in the minds of your target customers. **A brand concept is how a firm wants to be differentiated.** WestJet, for example, wants to be known as the airline brand that provides the best value--low prices and good service from friendly, personable staff that provides the best value. BC Ethic, the apparel manufacturer known for repopularizing the retro, button-down boling shirt style worn by Seinfeld's Kramer, positions its shirts as being "cool" and supports that differentiation by offering customized embroidered shirts free to music artists like the Barenaked Ladies and Cypress Hill. Most successful organizations are able to differentiate themselves on more than one dimension of value to customers. **Starbucks, for example, competes on quality (an affordable luxury), selection and customization (you can have it your way), convenience (many locations), and atmosphere(replacing bars as a place to socialize with friends)**. While much of marketing communication strategy involves establishing a brand's differentiation in the minds of its customers, sometimes the intended result is not achieved. **Brand image is the perceived positioning of a product by consumers.** Canadian consumers, for example, perceived positioning Knorr soups, sauces, and marinades as being "refined, polished, and sophisticated"--but Unilever wanted its Knorr brand to be more acessible and work as an everyday solution. The company developed its "A Little Bit More" Campaign to reinforce the idea that Knorr products have more interesting ingredients than competitors' brands and offer numerous opportunities for everyday culinary creativity. The phrase "a littl bit more" in Knorr's communication strategy is its slogan or tag line--which usually communicates the unique selling proposition or key point of differentiation underlying a brand's positioning.


### STRATEGIC ORIENTATION
* **Strategic orientation is the marketing strategy behind the desired differentation. It is the overall approach to how you plan to compete and create value for your customers. There are numerous frameworks or typologies that summarize key marketing and positioning strategies, and they all have different perspective on how prodcuts can be differentiated. One of these suggests that firms can focus on one or more of the following strategies: product leadership, customer intimacy, or operational excellence.** Product leadership is a strategy of competing by continually bringing innovative and useful new products or technologies to market. Adopted by companies such as 3M, Apple, and Nike, **it is concerned with product innovation, quality, performance, superiority, and other forms of functional value.** Positioning consistent with a product leadership strategy focuses on dimension such as the following:

        * Quality (e.g., FordL "Quality is Job 1"; Gillette: "The best a man can get")
        * Reliability or durability (e.g., Timex: "It takes a lick'n and keeps on tick'n")
        * Key features or attributes (e.g., Honda Civic: "Better gas mileage. A Civic responsibility")
        * Innovation (e.g., Lexus: "The relentless pursuit of excellence"; GE: "Progress is our most important product")
        * Performance (e.g., BMW: "The ultimate driving machine"; Apple: "The power to do your best")
        * Outcomes (e.g., Buckley's: "It tastes awful. And it works)

* Customer intimacy, or micro-marketing, is a strategy concerned with creating tailored solution for narrowly defined market segments. Companies such as Kraft, Nordstrom, Marriott, and Levi Strauss aim to excel at providing superior customer experiences and/or  personalized or customized interactions through outstanding service quality, customer support, flexibility, and customerization. Concerned with the creation of experiential or emotional value, customer intimacy positioning strategies focus on dimension such as the following:

        * Sensory experience (e.g., KFC: "Finger lick'n good"; A&W: "That frosty mug sensation")
        * Excitement, adventure (e.g., Nike: "Just do it"; Pontiac: "We drive excitement"; Club Med: "Do it now, do it fast, and do everything at the same time")
        * Fun or pleasure (e.g., Mcdonald's: "I'm lovin' it"; Lay's: "Betcha can't eat just one")
        * Emotion (e.g., harlequin: "Live the emotion"; Hallmark: "When you care enough to send the very best")
        * Social value (e.g., Dr Beers: "Diamonds are forever"; AT&T: "reach out and touch someone")
        * Responsiveness, customized, personalized (e.g., Burger King: "have it your)
        * Safety or security (e.g., Allstate: "You're in good hands with Allstate"; Michelin: "Because so much is riding on your tires")
        * Novelty, knowledge, or fantasy (e.g., Disney Online: "Where the magic comes to you"; Microsoft: "where do you want to go today?")

Operational excellence is a strategy focused on cost effectiveness, efficiency, and customer convenience. Companies such as Zellers, WestJet Airlines, Dell and Ikea are tenacious at lowering costs and customer prices while making it more convenient to do business with them. Concerned with the creation of cost-sacrifice value, operational excellence positioning strategies focus on dimension such as the following:

        * Price (e.g., Zeller: "The lowest price is the law"; Buy.com: "Canada's low price Internet superstore)
        * Value (e.g., Ikea: "Swedish for common sense)
        * Convenience (e.g., 7-Eleven: "Oh thank heaven"; American Express: "Don't leave home without it")
        * Personal investment of time, effort, or energy (e.g., yellow Page: "Let your fingers do the walking")
        * Risk (e.g., Levi's Jean: "Have you ever had a bad time in levi's?"; Listerine mouthwash: "Even your best friend won't tell you")

* Another common positioning strategy is concerned with **symbolic-expressive value--differentiating your brand by the psychological meaning associated with it.** **Some products (luxury goods for example) appeal to consumers' self-concept and self-worth--that is, they make us feel good about ourselves.** Other products (such as music or comfort foods, among many others) have personal meaning--association with people or events that only have meaning to a particular consumer (such as an association with Tide because Mom used it). Products can also provide Volkswagen Beetle, or Body Shop lotions allow consumers to reflect or express their personalities, tastes, and values. **Still other products focus on social meaning--how others see us.** Products such as BMW cars, Birks jewellery, and Lee Valley Tools are purchased because of their prestige, status, or image. Brands can also be positioned on one or more of these four symbolic meaning dimension. For example:

        * Self identity/concept/worth (e.g., L'Oreal: "Because I'm worth it")
        * Personal meaning (e.g., Kodak: "Share moments. Share life")
        * Self-expression (e.g., Canon: "Express yourself")
        * Social meaning (e.g., Grey Poupon: "Pardon me. Do you have any Grey Poupon?"; Rolls-Royce: "Trusted to deliver excellence")

* There are many other marketing strategy framework or typologigies that you will learn about in a marketing strategy course. However, there are some other ways to differentiate products and establish a brand's position in the marketplace. These include strategies that emphasize:

        * Product class leadership: The Mazda Miata is a sporty convertible
        * Relative positioning: The Pepsi Challenge claims "more people prefer the taste of Pepsi over Coke". (This is an example of head-to-head competitive positioning, **where other organizations try to associate their brand with the market leader**)
        * Use occasions: Wrigley's gum is an alternative at times when smoking is not permitted
        * user: Sunny Delight is the "Goodness kids go for"

### Defendability
* The choice of strategic orientation and the basis of differentiation is dependent on an organization's ability to defend the positioning. Analysis of your ability to defnd a particular positioning requires an assessment of the strengths and weakensses of your own organization and your ability to create sustainable competitive advantage, and the opportunities and threats in the external environment, in particular consumer behaviour and your assessment of the strategies and capabilities of your competitors (recall SWOT analysis).

## ANALYZE COMPETITORS' POSITIONS

## VALUE CREATION AND SUSTAINABLE COMPETITVE ADVANTAGE
* The second aspect of an assessment of defendability is to assess your ability to create the value proposition and basis of differentiation that you intend in your brand concept, and you ability to sustain your strategic orientation in the face of comeptitive reaction. Different strategic orientations require different organizational strengths (capabilities), focus, and resource allocation, and they are often associated with different organizational cultures

* **This makes it difficult to be the industry leader in more than one of these areas. At issue is whether an organization has the skills, abilities, resources, organizational structure, and culture to create the intended offer such that it will be perceived as superior by members of the target market on the differentiation dimensions reflected in the positioning strategy; whether the organization can communicate this effectively to the target market; and whether it can continue to do this until its goals are met as an organization.** Marketers need to explain how they are going to be able to sustain the basis for value creating differentiation in the minds of its target customer.
* There are three main ways to defend a positioning strategy. **The first is to continuously innovate to keep ahead of competitors. This is the approach typically followed by organizations adopting a product leadership strategy.** The second approach is to hide in a small enough niche market that competitors are not likely to enter--either because the market is not big enough to warrant attention, or because they are significant first-mover advantages in that market, such that followers into the market are at serious disadvantage. The third is to protect current source(s) of competitive advantage by erecting barriers to competition. Some of t hese barriers include:

        * Marketing expertise: companies that are market oriented and customer driven can protect a customer intimacy positioning by being closer to and more understanding of customer needs, wants, and behaviours; by being more flexible; and by being more responsive to customer
        * Customer loyalty: competitors find it difficult to get loyal customers to switch bransd. Companies who have developed loyal customers can protect their positioning by maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. Some strategy experts argue that relationships are the only true source of sustainable competitive advantage as other barriers can eventually be eroded.
        * Monopolization of a scarce resrouce: Retailers restrict competition by gaining exclusive access to retail locations. Other organizations secure exclusive supply or distribution contracts to limit the ability of competitors to enter markets.
        * Proprietary technology: patent, copyrights, and other mechanisms that protect intellectual property can help protect current sources of competitive advantage
        * Culture-based expertise: companies that develop core competencies or specialized knowledge in application, manufacturing, new product development, or other value creating activities within organizations can protect a positioning strategy based on that expertise if it permeates an organization's culture in a way that is difficult to emulate. Cultures take a long time to develop and it is very difficult for competitors to emulate culture-based expertise.
        * Legislation or regulatory approval: cellphone companies and cable companies are partially protected from competition by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunciations Commision and the need for regulatory approval to set up cell networks or cable networks
        * Capital requirements: high market-entry costs, such as the cost of specialized equipment, technology, or setting up a sales force or distribution channel, can be a barrier to competitors, particularly in small market niches that may support only one or two competitors

## BRINGING A PRODUCT TO LIFE: THE BRAND PERSONALITY
* The final element of a positioning strategy is creating a brand personality. Brands, like people, can be described in terms of personality traits. These descriptions might include words like cheap, elegant, sexy, bold, or wimpy. A positioning strate SKIM

## IMPLEMENTING THE POSITIONING STRATEGY
* **The success of a target marketing strategy hinges on a marketer's ability to identify and select an appropriate market segment or market segments** Then the marketer must devise a positioning that will set apart their offer from their competitors', that will be highly appealing to the target market, and that can be defended. The marketing mix decisions relating to product, pricing, distribution, and communication are then made in a way that supports the desired positioning. In effect, the marketing mix is the way that positioning get implemented. **Because everything else depends on segmentation and positioning decision, segmentation and positioning, together, are the two most important concepts in marketing.**
* Montreal-based G.I Energy Drinks developed the following strategy when it introduced the Guru energy drink. The company segmented the market in terms of age and psycholographics, and then target a segment of 16- to 24-year-olds, whose profiles indicated they were into "new-age" beverages that would give them a feeling of energy without unhealthy additives. The company reached these consumers by selling its drinks at raves in Montreal and Toronto, advertising in club culture magazines, and sponsoring events like snowboarding demonstrations. A company spokeperson describe the Guru positioning strategy this way: "We really feel the best way to reach people is trhough trial and onsite promotions... We want to provide the consumer with a drink that will enhance the activity they are already participating in"
* We previously discussed **some of the challenges in segmentation. The four main positioning challenge are: 1) vague positioning, where company do not clearly articulate their main point(s) of differentiation; 2) confused positioning, where the positioning strategy keeps changing (like McDonald's), making it difficult for consumers or customers to understand what the brand is supposed to mean to them; 3) off-target positioning, where companies do not differentiate themselves on dimension important to consumers or customers; and 4) over positioning, where companies position themsleves too narrowly, either appealing to too small a market segment or being unable to change or adapt their positioning with changing market condition.**
* *Evaluate the target market's responses and modify the strategy*. The target marketing process is ongoing. Over time an organization like Molson may find that it needs to change the segments it targets, and the needs or wants of people in these chosen segments may change as well. Marketers need to monitor these changes and adjust their positioning strategies when necessary. Sometimes marketers redo a product's position to respond to marketplace changes.

Marketing Concepts: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. Some critics of marketing have suggested that marketing segmentation and target marketing lead to an unnecessary proliferation of product choices, which wates valuable resources. These critics suggest that if marketers didn't create so many different product choices, there would be more resources to feed the hunry, house the homeless, and provide for the needs of people around the globe.

## THE STEPS IN THE MARKETING RESEARCH PROCESS
* The collection and interpretation of strategic information is hardly a one-shot deal that managers engage in "just out of curiosity". Ideally, marketing research is an ongoing process, a series of steps marketers take to learn about the marketplace. Whether a company conducts the research itself or hire another firm to do it, the goal is the sam--**to help managers make informed marketing decision**

        ->

        * Prepare the Research Report: Executive summary; description of methodology; discussion of results; limitation; conclusion and recommendation 

#### Define the problem
* Defining the research problem as precisely as possible allows marketers to search for the right answers to the right questions. Sometimes marketers can not determine exactly what the problem is because they're focusing on symptoms, such as declining sales, and not on the underlying problem that's causing sales to drop. For example, a drop in sales of a sunscreen may be due to a new competitor, lack of cooperation from distributors, or even a fashion trend promoting a deep tan.

Defining the problem has four components:
1. Specify the management decision: the most important stage of the research process is figuring out what marketing (or other) decisions need to be made with the information being sought. For example, **is the key decision "What market segment should I target?" or is the key decision "How could I price this product?"** The research needed for making the first decision won't be useful for making the second decision or vice versa--**and generally, you can only focus on one key decision in any given piece of research because different decisions require different research questions, samples, and methods. Specifying the relative importance of the decision is also useful as it helps guide the scope of the research activity and how much time, effort, and resources should be allocated to the project.**
2. Specify the research objectives or research questions. What questions will be research attempt to answer? Once the key decision is identified, **you need to ask yourself "what general questions do I need to answer to make that decision?" For example, if the key decision is "What market segment should I target?" some key questions (among others) that need to be answered are: What are the key alternative market segments? What are the profile and size of these segments? What brands are currently targeted at each segment? How is our brand positioned (or how might it be positioned) relative to competitors? What are sources of competitive advantage that will allow us to defnd our desired positioning?**
* Often the importance of a research question surface during exploratory resarch. For example, Mercedes-Benz regularly monitors drivers' perceptions of its cars, partly through feedback from dealers. When the company started getting reports from its dealers that people were viewing the cars as being deserved only after they become "successful", it developed the "ice crean" television ad. It attempts to dispel the attitude that consuemrs should wait until their big promotion to indulge themselves. Often marketers want to know how much of a product they are likely to sell. There are many approaches to developing a sales forecast. Some of the common approaches are described in Appendix 4B.
3. Identify the information needs. Once research specify the resarch questions or objectives, **they need to specify what needs to be learned or known, and from whom--indicating the population or group of interest.** For example, to answer the research question "What are the profile of each segment?" we would want to know specific information like: What are the benfit sought by each identified segment? What are the demographic dcharacteristics of each segment? (e.g., sex, age, income), what are the psychographic characteristics of each segment (e.g., lifestyle, interests, values), what are the media use behaviours for each segment (e.g., magazine and newspapers read, radio stations listened to, TV programs watched)
* **These information needs are not the questions you would see in a questionaire or interview guide, but they inform those questions and give a researcher rationale for including or not including specific questions on a questionaire. If the question does not address an information need, it is not required on the questionaire.** Information needs also inform methodology, or the research technique, as different types of information can be gathered from different sources or by using different techniques.
4. Place the problem in an environmental context. The problem definition should also specify the factors in teh firm's internal and external business environment that might be causing or influencing the situation. Placing the problem in the context of the firm's environment helps researchers structure the research, determine the specific types of questions to ask, and identify factors they will need to take into account when interpreting results. Environmental conditions also provide a valuable perspective. For example, when the economy is tight and sales of luxury cars are generally declining, the propulation to be studied might be narrowed down to a select group of consumers who are still willing and able to indulge in a luxury vehicle. Alternatively, consuemrs may be moving away from glitzt status-conscious materialism, so that the research question comes down to how promotional strategies can convey honest and basic values that go beyond "snob appeal".

#### Determine the Research Design
* Once marketers have isolated specific problems, the second step of the research processis to decide on a "plan of attack". **This plan is the researrch design, which specifies what information marketers will collect and what type of study they will do.** All marketing problems do not call for the same techniques, even though marketers can solve some problems effectively with a number of alternative techniques, and diversity in approaches can often provide greater insight and greater confidence in the results.

        Secondary Research -> Internal Sources -> Company reports; previous company research; salesperson feedback;customer feedback
                        -> External Resources: Publish research; trade organizations; syndicated research; government sources
        
        Primary Research -> Exploratry Research -> Interviews; focus groups; projective techniques; case studies; ethnographies

                        -> Descriptive research -> Cross-sectional; longitudinal
                        -> Causal Research -> Laboratory research; field studies

* **Secondary versus primary research**: The very first question to ask in determining the research design is whether or not the information required for making a decision already exists--either inside the organization or from external secondary sources. For example, a coffee producer who needs to know the differences in coffee consumption among different demographic and geographic segments of the market may find that the information needed is available from a study conducted by the Canadian Coffee Association for its members or even from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Data that are collected for some purpose other than the problem at hand are called secondary data. The use of secondary data can save time and money because the expense of designing and implementing a study has already been paid. however, secondary data, having been created for another purpsoe, may not be current enough or relevant enough for a particular marketing decision. Another key limitation of secondary data is the methodology used to collect it is often not reported and users do not know whether there were any flaws or limitations in the research design
* Sometimes secondary research is not enough. When a company needs to make a specific decision, it often needs to conduct research to collect primary data--that is, information collected directly from respondents to specifically address the question at hand. The advantage of primary data is that designed specifically to meet the needs of the organization. however, collecting primary data can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process.
* **Exploratory (Qualitative) research**: Marketers use exploratory research to generate topics for future, more rigorous studies, ideas for new strategies and opportunities; or just to get better handle on a problem they are experiencing with a product. Because **the studies are usually small in scale and less costly to conduct than other techniques**, **marketers can use exploratory research to test their hunches about what's going on without too much risk. Exploratory research often involve in-depth probing of a few consumers who fit the profile of the "typical" customer. Researchers may interview consumers, salespeople, watch what people do when choosing among competing brands in a store aisle. Or they may locate places where the consuemrs of interest hang out and ask questions in these settings.** Some researchers find that many young people are too suspicious or skeptical in traditional research settings, so they may interview young people waiting in lines to buy concert tickets or in clubs. Pantene and Sony, for example, have reached over **500,000 Canadian teens** by sponsoring high school video dance parties and then providing incentive for the teens to visit the company webistes to provide product feedback and answer buying behaviour questions. Corby Distilleries discovered that **its focus groups were more effective when carried out in its consumers' natural environment--their local bar on a Friday night.**
* Most exploratory research **provides qualitative data, detailed verbal or visual information (for example, videotapes of people preparing dinner at home) about consumers' attitudes, feelings, and buying behaviours that is summarized in words rather than numbers.** Researchers for a manufacturer of Swiss chocolate, for example, interviewed consumers and found that many chocolate lovers hide secret stashes around their home. The company used the results of this exploratory research to develop an advertising campaign built around the theme: "The True Confessions of Chocaholic".
* Exploratory research can take many forms. **Consumer interviews are one-on-one discussions in which an individual shares his or her thoughts in person with a researcher.** In addition to interviewing actual users of their product, some marketers find it useful to interview people who may not themselves be consumers, but who may know a lot about the consumers. **One Canadian ad agency working on an ad campaign for scotch interviewed bartenders to gain additional insight into scotch drinkers.** Another agency in England, working on an ad for a shoe company, talked to people who shined shoes...SKIM
* The **focus group** is the technique marketing researchers most often use for collecting exploratory data. Focus groups usually **consist of eight to twelve recruited consumers**, who sit together to discuss a product, ad, or some other marketing topic introduced by a discussion leader or moderator. Ontario energy and enery service provider Direct Energy, for example, used focus group in a repositioning process that resulted in the company wanting to be known for its people and ideas rather than just for its products, technology, or dependability. Typically, the moderator tapes these group discussions, which may be held at speical interivewing facilities that allow for observation ("spying") by the client, who watches from behind a one-way mirror. Focus group don't always run smoothly, particularly if one or two opinionated members dominate the session or if "professional" focus group participants get by screening criteria intended to ensure that the participants fit the intended participant profile. Researchers screen focus group participants in advance to meet criteria that will make their opinions relevant. For example, participants may be recruited, not because they use the company's brand, but because they use a competitor's product.
* As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, web-based research companies like SurveySite are able to conduct focus groups with people around the country or around the world by setting up interactive sessions online. Many researchers use **projective techniques** to **get at people's underlying feelings, especially when they feel that people will be unable or unwilling to express their true reactions. A projective test asks the participant to respond to some ambiguous object, often by telling a story about it.
* The **case study** is a comprehensive examination of a particular firm or organization. In business-to-business marketing research in which the customers are other firms, for example, researchers may try to learn how one company makes its purchases. Their goal is to identify the key deicsion makers, to learn what criteria they emphasize when choosing between suppliers, and perhaps to learn something about any conflicts and rivalries among these decision makers that may influence their choices.
* Ethnography SKIM

* **DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH**: We've seen that marketers have many tools at their disposal, including focus groups and ethnographic techniques, to help them better define a problem or opportunity. These are usually modest studies involving a small number of people. In some situations, this information is all that the marketer needs to make decisions; but very often, the next step after exploratory research is to conduct descriptive research, **which probes more systematically into the problem and bases its conclusion on larger numbers of observations.** These observations typically are quantitative data that take the form of averages, percentages, or other statistics summarizing results from a large set of measurements. Quantitative data can be as simple as the number of large-screen TVs sold in a month in Future Shop locations in different regions of the country, or as complex as statistical analyses of responses to a survey mailed to thousands of consumers. In each case, **analyses are conducted to answer a specific question in contrast to the "fishing expedition" that may occur in exploratory research.**
* The most common descriptive technique is **cross-sectional design**. This involves the systematic collection of quantitative information, such as responses to a survey or data from store register receipts, from one or more samples of respondents at one point in time. The data may be collected on more than one occasion but generally not from the same pool of respondents. Lever Pond's did a cross-sectional survey of dermatologists to determine which soap they recommend to their paitents for mildness. **Since 87 percent of the respondents recommended the Lever Pond's brand Dove, and only 13 percent recommended the competitive brand, the company turned the results of its survey directly into an advertising campaign. Outdoor billboards that showed the results of the survey were used in major centres across Canada**.
* longitudinal design SKIM

* **CAUSAL RESEARCH**: It is a fact that purchases of both diapers and beer peak between 5pm and 7pm. Can we say that purchasing one of t hese products caused shoppers to purchase the other as well--and, if so, which caused which? Or is the answer simply that this happens to be the time that young faters stop at the store on their way home from work for brew and Pampers?
* The descriptive techniques we've examined do a good job of providing valuable information about what is happening in the marketplace, but they can't tell us why. Sometimes marketers need to know if something they've done has brought about some change in behaviour. For example, does the layout and design of a store affect the amount people buy? This questions can't be answered through simple observation.
* For example, managers at a grocery chain notice from their sales data across a number of stores that purchases of produce are higher in those stores that are designed to resemble farmers' market, with free-flowing layouts and "stalls" where produce is displayed. Can we say that design of these stores caused the increased sales, or is the answer simply that these stores happen to be located in areas where people buy more produce no matter what the store look like?
* Causal research refers to techniques that attempt to understand cause-and-effect relationships. In causal research, marketers want to know if a change in something (for example, layout used in a store) is responsible for a change in something else (for example, an increase in produce sales). They call the factors that might cause such a change independent variables and outcomes dependent variables. In this example, the layout of the store is an independent vairable and sales data for producre are a dependent variable.
* To rule out alternative exaplanations, researchers must carefully design experiments that test specified relationships among variables in a controlled environment. Because this approach tries to eliminate competing explanations for the outcome, respondents may be brought to a laboratory where the researcher can be sure that they are reacting to precisely what they should be and nothing else. For example, a study testing whether the layout in a grocery store influences the likelihood that shoppers will buy more produce might bring a group of people into a testing facility, where they are shown a "virtual store" on a computer screen and asked to fill a grocery cart as they click through the "aisle". The experiment might vary the interior of the store as a market style layout or a more typical grid layout to see if this affects whether people put more produce into their carts. SKIM

### Choose t he Method for Collecting Data
* When the researcher decides to conduct descriptive research, the next step in the marketing research process is to figure out just how to collect it. **The two main primary data collection methods can be broadly described as interactive and passive**.
* **INTERACTIVE METHODS** Interactive methods involve some kind of interview or other direct contact with respondents who answer questions. These responses are then combined with those of other respondents to arrive at some general conclusions. **The most common interactive instrument is a survey, a questionaire asking participants about their beliefs or behaviours**. For example, when Virgin Mobile wanted to find a theme for its new promotional campaign, it conducted a survey of Canadian cellphone users to find out what it would take for consumers to switch from their current cellphone provider. The survey found that 40 percent of Canadian respondents indicated that if they could retain the cellphone numbers, they would switch. Virgin used this insight to develop a new campaign centred around the "you can switch" concept. Surveys can be administered on the phone, in person, through the mail, by fax, or over the Internet.
* Surveys or questionaires differ in their degree of structure. With a totally unstructured questionaire, the researcher loosely determines the questions in advance. Questions may evolve from what the respondent says to previous questions. At the other extreme the researcher uses a completely structured questionaire. She asks every respondent the exact same questions and each participant responds to the same set of fixed choices. You have probably experienced this kind of questionaire, where you might have had to respond to a statement by saying if you "strongly agree", "somewhat agree", and so on. Moderately structured questionaires ask each respondent the same questions, but the respondent is allowed to answer the questions in his own words.
* Surveys can be administered in a variety of ways, each of which has its pros and cons.
1. **Mail Surveys**: Mail surveys are easy to administer and offer a **high degree of anonymity to respondents**. On the downside, because the questionnaire is printed and mailed, researchers have **little flexibility in the types of questions they can ask** and **little control over the circumstances under which the respondent is answering them**. Mail surveys also take a long time to get back to the company and are likely to **have a much lower response rate** than other types of surveys because people tend to ignore them
2. **Telephone Survey**: Telephone surveys usually consist of a brief phone conversation in which an interviewer reads a short list of questions to the respondent. One problem with this approach is that the growth of telemarketing, the sale of products and services over the phone, has eroded the willingness of many consumers to participate in phone surveys--especially when those telemarketers have pretended to be conducting marketing research. Another drawback of telephone survey is that the respondent may not feel comfortable speaking directly to an interviewer, especially if the survey is about a sensitive subject. Finally, increasing numbers of people use answering machines and caller identification to screen calls, further reducing the response rate.
3. **Face-to-face Surveys**: Face-to-face surveys, in which a live interviewer asks questions of a respondent by, for example, going door to door, used to be a common way to collect data. However, this practice has declined markedly in recent years due to escalating costs and security concerns--people just aren't willing to open their doors to strangers anymore. More typically, today's face-to-face interviews occur in a "mall-intercept" study in which researchers recruit shoppers in malls or other public areas. Mall-intercepts offer good opportunities to get feedback about marketing issues like new package designs or styles or even reactions to new foods or fragances. **However, because only certain goups of the population frequently shop at malls, a mall-intercept study does not provide the researcher with a representative sample of the population unless the population of interest is mall shoppers.** In addition to the mall-intercept being more expensive than mail or phone surveys, respondents may be relutant to answer questions of a personal nature in a face-to-face context. Rather than relying on face-to-face surveys, Staple Business Depot Canada decided to use **automated kiosks in its stores to survey consumers about their satisfaction with the company.** Because of the anonymity that the kiosk affords respondents, the company estimates that two out of three people take part in the kiosk surveys, compared with one out of three who are asked to do a face-to-face survey.
* **Online Surveys**: Online surveys are growing in popularity. The Carrier Corporations, which makes air conditioners, found respondents more willing to answer questions about its products via computer, perhaps because it's more interesting to take a survey this way. Companies are making it even easier for consumers to respond to surveys by administering surveys on handheld devices like Palms and Pockets PCs. Online surveys are a quick and cost-effective way to collect data. Unlike mail and phone surveys, online surveys can generate a large number of responses very quickly. However, it must be remembered that, like the people who visit malls, people who use the Internet are not respresentative of the total population. Online surveys are, therefore, useful only for those companies whose population of interest is people who are online. An additional concern about online surveys relates to the quality of responses the firm will receive--particularly because no one can be really sure who is typing in the responses. Online research is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
* **PASSIVE METHODS**: Other forms of data collection use a passive instrument in which the consumer's behaviour are simmply recorded--often without his or her knowledge. Reseachers do this through personal observation, unobtrustive measures, and mechanical observation.
* **Personal Observation**: with personal obversation, consumers in public settings are watched to understand how they react to marketing activities. After Frito-Lay spent some time in grocery stores, it found that shoppers spend a lot less time in grocery stores, it found that shoppers spend a lot less time in the grocery store, and spend little time in the aisles. This meant that it had to get its product displays on the perimeter of the store whenever possible. Researchers for Rocky Mountaineer rail tours observed its customers' behaviour as they were travelling through the Canadian Rockies by train. They noticed that these travellers seemed to like the experience of the train trip itself as much as the beautiful scenery they were seeing. **This led the company to change the theme of its advertising from just talking about the mountain scenery to talking about the train service experience. One of the ads claimed: "No one ever wrote a fold song about a minivan", and the overall slogan for the new ads was "The only way to see the Canadian Rokies". The company saw a 23 percent increase in its bookings as a result of the ads.**
* Some companies have successfully used observation in combination with other methods, such as consumer interviews, in an effort to improve the quality of information gathered. **To examine how consumers make milk brand decisions, researchers in Atlantic Canada observed over 200 consumers in 12 stores and followed up with a brief interviews. In the interviews, consumers claimed that they bought a certain brand, even though the researcher knew fromm observation that they had bought a different one. Similarly, in interviews most consumers claimed that they checked the expiry date on the milk cartons, whereas observation showed that hardly anyone did so. All of this information allowed the researchers to conclude that milk is a low-involvement purchasing decision with weak loyalty levels. The consumers were not deliberately lying in the interviews, they simply did not pay that much attention to their milk buying behaviour. As this example, shows, sometimes it is wise to use multiple research methods when performing marketing reseach.**
* **Unobstrusive Measure**: Researchers also use unobstrusive measures to check traces of physical evidence that remain after some action has been taken, when they suspect that people will probably alter their behaviour if they know they are being observed 
* **Mechanical Observation**: Mechanical observation relies on non-human devices to record behaviour. For example, some grocery stores use GPS units on their grocery carts to track shoppers' movement through their stores to determine shopping patterns and hot spots.

#### Data Quality: Garbage In, Garbage out
* A firm can gather data in many ways, including focus groups, ethnographies, observational studies, and controlled experiments. But how much faith should it place in what it finds? 
* A research project is only a good as the information it collects. All too often, marketers who have commissioned a study assume that because they have a massive report full of impressive-looking numbers and tables, they must have the "truth". Unfortunately, there are times when this "truth" is really jsut one person's interpretation of the facts. At other times, the data used to generate recommendations areflawed. Typically, three factors influence the quality of research results--validity, reliability, and representativeness
* **VALIDITY**: Validity is the extend to which the research actually measures what it was intended to measure. This was partof the problem underlying the famous New Coke fiasco in the 1980, in which Coca-Cola underestimated people's loyalty to its flagship soft drink after it relaced "Old Coke" with a new, sweeter formula. The company assumed that blind taste testers' preferences for one anonymous cola over another were a valid measure of consumers' preferences for a cola brand. Coke found out the hard way that only measuring taste is not the same as measuring people's deep allegiances to their favourite soft drink, and sales eventually recovered after the company brought back the old version as "Coca-Cola Classic".
* **RELIABILITY** Reliability is the extent to which the research measurement techniques are free of errors. Sometimes, for example, the way a researcher asks a question creates an error by biasing people's responses. Imagine that an interviewer working for Trojans condoms stopped male college students on campus and asked them if they used contraceptive products. Do you think their answers might change if they were asked the same questionson an anonymous survey they received in the mail? Most likely they would be different, **because people are relutant to disclose what they actually do when their responses are not anonymous. Reseachers try to maximize reliability by thinking of several different ways to ask the same questions, by asking these questions on several occasions, or by using several analysts to interpret the responses.**
* Reliability is a problem when the researchers can't be sure the consuemr population they're studying even understands what is being asked. For example, children are difficult subjects for market researchers, because they tend to be undependable reporters of their own behaviour, have poor recall, and often do not understand abstract questions. in many cases, the children can not explain why they prefer one item over another (or they are not willing to share these secrets with grown-ups). For these reasons, researchers have had to be especially creative in designing studies involving younger consumers. In the example shown (called a commpletion test), boys are told to write in the empty balloon what they think the boy in the darwing will answer when the girl ask, "What program do you want to watch next?" Reliability is increased because the children can respond to pictures depicting a familiar situation in their own words.
* **REPRESENTATIVENESS** Representativeness is the extend to which consumers in the study are similar to a larger group in which the organization has an interest. This criterion for evaluating research underscores the importance of **sampling**, the process of selecting respondents for a study. The issue then becomes how large or small  the sample should be and how these people are chosen. 

#### Design the Sample
* **Once the researcher has defined the problem, decided on a research design, and determined how to collect the data, the next step is to decide from whom to obtain the needed data.** Of course, the researcher could collect the information from every single customer or prospective customer, but this would be extremely expensive and time consuming, if possible at all. Instead, researchers collect most of their data from a small proportion or sample of the population of interest. Based on the answers of this sample, researchers hope to generalize to the larger population. Whether such inferences are accurate or inaccurate depends on the type and quality of the study sample. There are two main types of samples: probability and non probability samples.
* **PROBABILITY SAMPLING**: **With a probability sample, each member of the population has some known chance of being included in the sample**. Using a probability sample ensures researchers that the sample is representative of the population and that inferences about the population made from the sample are justified. For example, if a larger percentage of males than females in a probability sample say they prefer action movies to "chick flicks", one can infer with confidence that a larger percentage of males than females in the general population also would rather see a character get sliced and diced.
* The most basic type of probability sample is a **simple random sample** in which every member of a population has a known and equal chance of being included in the study. For example, if we simply take the names of all 40 students in your class and put them in a hat and draw one out, each member of your class has a 1 in 40 chance of being included in the sample. In most studies the population from which the sample will be drawn is too large for a hat, so marketers use a computer program to generate a random sample from a list of members of the population.
* Sometimes researchers use a **systematic sampling** procedure in which they select the nth member of a population after a random start. For example, if we want a sample of 10 members of your class, we might begin with the second person on the roll and select every fourth name after that; that is, the second, the sixth, the tenth, the 14th, and so on. Researchers know that studies that use systematic samples are just as accurate as simple random samples. Unless a list of members of the population of interest is already in a computer data file, it is a lot simpler to create a systematic sample. 
* Another type of probability sample is **a stratified sample** in which a research divides the population into segments that are related to the study's topic. For example, imagine that you are interested in studying what movies are most likely by members of a population. You know from prevvious studies that men and women in the population differ in their attitude toward different types of movies--men like action flicks and women like romances. To create a stratified sample, you would first divde the population into male and female segments. **Then respondents from each of the two segments would be selected randomly in proportion to their percentage of the population.** In this way, you have created a sample that is proportionate to the population on a characteristic that you know will make a difference in the study results.
* **Cluster sampling** also divides a population into groups, but in this approach the groups are representative microcosms of a population, in that each reflects the characteristics of the population as a whole. **In cluster sampling the population is divded into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subpopulations and then a subset of the groups is chosen using a probability sampling technique like a simple random sample. Respondents are then chosen within the groups using another probability sampling technique.** Cluster sampling is quite cost effective because you only have to create a sampling frame (list of potential respondents) for the cluster groups chosen. **Political pollsters use cluster sampling to make national assessments of party popularity based on the responses of a few hundred voters.**
* **NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING** Sometimes researchers do not feel that the time and effort required to develop a probability sample are justified, perhaps because they need an answer quickly or they just want to get a general sense of how people feel about a topic. They may choose a non-probability sample, **which entails the use of personal judgment in selecting respondents--in some cases just asking whomever they can find**. With a non-probability sample, some members of the population have no chance at all of being included in the sample. Thus, there is no way to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. **Results from non-probability studies can be generally suggestive of what is going on in the real world but not necessarily definitive.**
* A **convenience sample** is a non-probability sample composed of individuals who just happen to be available when and where the data are being collected. For example, if you simply stand in fron of the student union and ask students who walk by to complete you questionnaire, that would be a convenience sample.

Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing
* The purpose of this mini-project is to familarize you with research techniques used by marketers and to help you apply these techniques to managerial decision making.
1. With a group of three other students in your class, select a small retail business or fast-food restaurant to use as a "client" for your project. Be sure to get the manager's permission before conducting your research. Then choose a topic from among the following possibilities to develop a study problem:

        * Employee-customer interactions
        * The busiest periods of customer activity
        * Customer perceptions of service
        * Customer likes and dislikes about offerings
        * Customer likes and dislikes about the environment in the place of business
        * The benefits customers perceive to be important
        * The age groups that frequent the place of business
        * The age groups that frequent the place of business
        * The buying habit of a particular age group
        * How customer complaints are handled

2. Develop a plan for the research:

        a. Define the problem as you will study it
        b. Choose the type of research you will use
        c. Select the techniques you will use to gather data
        d. Develop the mode and format for data collection

3. Conduct the research
4. Write a report or develop a class presentation that includes four parts.

        a. Introduction: a brief overview of the business and the problem studied
        b. Methodology: The type of research used, the techniques used to gather data (and why they were chosen), the instruments and procedures used, the number of respondents, duration of the study, and other details that would allow someone to replicate your study.
        c. Results: a compilation of the results (perhaps in table form) and the conclusions drawn
        d. Recommmendations: A list of recommendations for actions management might take based on the conclusions drawn from the study.

Real People, Real Surfers: Explore the Web
* Monitoring changes in demographics and other consumer trends is an important part of the marketing intelligence included in an MIS. Today, much of this information is gathered by government research and is available on the Internet.
* Statistics Canada provides talbed data for Canadian cites at its site, **www.statcan.ca**. Using both Statistics Canada data and any other data you can find on the Internet, develop a report on a Canadian city of your choice that answers the following questions:

        1.What is the total population of the city
        2. Describe the population of the area in terns of age, income, education, ethnic background, marital status, occupation, and housing
        3. How does the city compare to the demographic characteristics of the entire Canadian populatiokn
        4. What is your opinion of the different websites you used? How useful are they to marketers? How easy were they to navigate? Was  there information you wanted that was not available? Was there more or less information from the sites than you had anticipated? Explain

# CHAPTER 5: Consumer Buying Behaviour

## UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS
* Compelling new products, clever packaging, and creative advertising surround us, clamouring for our attention--and our money. But consumers don't all respond in the same way to marketing activies. Each consumer is a unique person, with unique reasons for choosing one product over another. As Ron Outerbridge of Coast Tire knows, the first step in building long-term relationships is understanding your customer. Recall that the focus of the marketing concept is to satisfy consumers' wants and needs. **These wants and needs can be satisfied only to the extent that marketers understand why and how people buy products.** D-Code, for example, is a Canadian research firm that helps Canadian marketers understand 18- to 34-year-old "Nexus" consumers by answering such questions as, What are the attitudes and lifestyles of Nexus consumers, why do they prefer certain products, which ads do they respond to, and how do they purchase products? Uthink, another Canadian marketing research and strategy firm, offers similar services to help marketers understand 13- to 29-year-old. **Consumer behaviour is the process individuals or groups go through to select, purchase, and use goods, services, ideas, or experiences**. Marketers recognize that consumer behaviour is an ongoing process--it is more than what happens at the moment a consumer hands over money and, it turn, receives a good or service.
* Although it seems as if some purchases are made spontaneously (and we may regret our rashness later), **in reality we make most buying decisions only after we have undergone a series of steps--problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, product choice, and post-purchase evaluation.**
* Let's look at an example of a consumer purchase--one you yourself probably make on a regular basis: dry cereal. While this may seem like a simple purchase, in reality there are quite a few steps in the process that cereal marketers need to understand. The first decision in the process is where to buy your cereal. If you eat a lot of cereal, you may choose to make a special trip to a wearehouse-type retailer, such as Costco, that sells very large boxes of cereal. Of course, if you get a yearning for cereal in the middle of the night, you may dash to the local convenience store. Then there is the decision of the type of cereal. Do you eat only low-fat, high-fibre bran cereals, or do you go for sugar-coated varieties with marshmallows? As you can see, the purchase decision for something as simple as cereal can actually be quite complicated.
* Traditionally, researchers have tried to understand how consuemrs make decisions by assuming that people carefully collect information about competing products, determine which products possess the characteristics or product attributes important to their needs, weigh the pluses and minuses of each alternative, and arrive at a satisfactory decision. But how accurate is this picture of the decision-making process?
* Although it does seem that people undergo these steps when making an important purchase, is it realistic to assume that they do this for everything they buy? Researchers now realize that consumers actually possess a set of decision approaches, ranging from painstaking analysis to pure whim, depending on the importance of what is being bought and how much effort the person is willing to put into the decision. Researchers have found it convenient to think in terms of an "effort" continuum, which is anchored on one end by habitual (or routine) decision making (such as deciding t o purchase a can of pop) and at the other end by extended problem solving (such as deciding to purchase a computer). Many decisions fall somewhere in the middle and are characterized by **limited problem solving, which means that consumers do work to make a decision, but most likely rely on simple rules of thumb instead of learning about and conisdering all the ins and outs of every product alternative. For most of use, the dry cereal purchase decision described above falls into the limited problem solving category.** Some Internet marketers believe that the Internet can reduce the effort needed to make product decisions by offering so many products and services in one place. 
* **Involvement** Determines the extend of effort a person puts into deciding what to buy. Involvement is the importance of the perceived consequences of the purchase to the person. **As a rule, we are more involved in the decision-making process for products that we perceive as being important, pleasurable, or risky in some way.** Perceived risk may be present if the product is expensive, complex, and hard to understand, or if the purchase of the wrong product could result in embarrassment or social rejection. For instance, some people perceive clothing purchases as risky because they feel a wrong choice could lead to negative social consequences. Perceived risk can also be a factor in the buying process for certain products. A study of condom buying among Canadian university students, for example, found that 66 percent of men and 60 percent of women reported being embarrassed when buying condoms and, therefore, do not buy them. As one researcher put it, "Approaching the cashier is the moment of truth. There is also the worry that a 'price check on a 12-pack of Durex condom' will be announced to the entire store". Marketers will sometimes refer to high- or low-involvement product, but this is misleading. **Products are not high or low involvement--decision are. What is a high-involvement decision for one consumer may be a low involvement decision for another.** Bill Gate, for example, probably doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about what type of television to buy. When marketers say that a car is high-involvement product, they really mean it is a high-involvement decision for most consumers.
* When perceived risk is low, as in buying a pack of gum, the consumer feels low involvement in the decision-making process, the consumer is not overly concerned about which option he or she chooses because it is not especially important or risky. **In low-involvement situations, the consumer's decision is often a response to environmental cues, such as deciding to try a new type of chewing gum because it is prominently displayed at a store checkout counter.** Under these circumstances, managers must concentrate on how products are displayed at the time of purchase to influence the decision maker. **For example, a chewing gum marketer may decide to spend or to change the color of the gum wrapper to a bright pink to be sure it gets noticed among the other gums.**
* For other purchase decisions, such as for a house, car computer, or interview suit, the consumer is more likely to carefully process all the available information and to have thought about the decision well before buying the item. **The consequences of the purchase are important and risky, especially because a bad decision can result in significant financial losses, aggravation, decreased performance, or embarrassment. These types of purchase decisions are high involvement decisions.** Products are not inherently high or low involvement, but the level of involvement engaged by a consumer is often associated with the price, importance, and perceived risk of the purchase decision. So for products purchased with a high-involvement decision process, managers must start to reduce perceived risk by educating the consumer about why their product is the best choice well in advance of the time that the consumer is ready to make a decision. To understand what goes on during each of the steps in the decision-making process, in the next section we'll follow the fortunes of one consumer, a student named Emma, who is in the market for a new notebook computer. This is a high-involvement purchase decision for her because of the cost of the product and because the performance of the computer will have an important impact on her own performance in courses and, perhaps, in future jobs.

## Problem Recognition
* Problem recognition occurs whenever the consumer sees a significant difference between their current state of affairs and some desired or ideal state. The consumer needs to solve a problem, which may be small or large, simple or complex. Emma has a problem. She needs t o have a computer for writing papers, doing research on the Internet, and sending e-mail, but the computers provided on campus are always busy when she needs a computer the most, such as at the end of term. Emma also wants her computer to be portable so that she can use it to take notes in classes and take it to the library while she researches her assignments. Thinking about the future, Emma realizes that, in her job, she will probably have a lot of work to do after hours. having a notebook computer will allow her to do the work in the comfort of her own apartment.
* Do marketing decisions have a role in buyers' problem recognition? Although most problem recognition occurs spontaneously, **marketers can develop creative advertising messages that stimulate consumers to recognize that their current state--that old car--just doesn't equal a shiny, new convertible**

                PR1: Encourage consumers to see that existing state does not equal desired state
                PR2: TV commercials showing the excitement of owning a new car
                IS1: Provide information when and where consumers are likely to search
                IS2: Targeted advertising on TV programs with hih target market viewership; Sales training that ensures knowledgeable salespeople; make new car brochures available inn dealer showrooms; design exciting, easy to navigate, and informative websites
                EA1: Understand the criteria consumers use in comparing brands and commmunicate own brand superiority
                EA2: Conduct research to identify most immportant evaluative criteria; create advertising that includes reliable data on superiority of a brand (e.g., kilometres per litre, safety, comfort)
                PC1: Understand choice heuristics used by consumers and provide communication that encourages brand decision

                PPE1: Encourage accurate consumer expectations; 
                PPE2: Provide honest advertising and sales presentation

## Information Search
* Once Emma recognizes her computer problem, she needs adequate information to resolve it. During the information search part of the decision-making process, **consumers check their memory and survey the environment to identify what options exist to solve the problem. Marketing communication helps consumers in this task, and many advertisements are focused on generating awareness about brands.** When Virgin Mobile launched its new Virgin brand cellphone service in Canada, it kicked off its campaign with an innovative publicity stunt to create immediate awareness for its brand. Attached to a wire and dressed as Captain Canada, Richard Branson, the chair and founder of Virgin Group, jumped from a 15-storey media tower in Toronto's Dundas Square, and then proceeded to ride a monster truck over three cars representing his company's wireless competition. For her information search, Emma might rely on ads she has seen for notebook computers, recommendations from friends, and additional research she might do by reading Consumer reports and PC Magazine, or by signing onto websites for companies, such as Dell Canada and Apple Canada. She also might vist some electronics stores, like Future Shop, where she can discuss her purchase with salespeople and try out some computers.
* Increasingly, consumers are using Internet search engines, portals, or "shopping bots" for information search. Search engines are sites such as Google, AltaVista, and Webcrawler that find information on the web by searching sites for keywords. Other sites such as Expedia simplify searches because they organize information from a lot of separate websites according to common themes. Consider the purchase of a new car. The car dealer was once the key source of information during the information search stage of a new car purchase. Now, most new car purchasers visit a car dealership only after extensive research on the Internet.
* When they understand the stages of the consumer decision process, marketers can develop strategies to lead consumers to a choice that pleases both the consumer and the marketer.
* Some portals, such as Yahoo Kids, focus on specific customer segments. This unique portal makes it easy for kids to access information relevant to them, such as homework tips, games, and music. The site include a feature called "Ask Earl", where kids can type in any question, such as "What is plagiarism?" and receive an answer back, written in language that is easy for them to understand. Yahoo Canada recently launched a new site aimed at women aged 24 to 54. The site includes content from Canadian sources such as Chatelaine and Today's Parent, as well as U.S. sources such as Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray. The site also includes blogs from personality like athlete Gabby Reece, plus a question and answer feature.
* Robots, also called "shopbots", or "intelligence agents", are software programs used by some websites that find Internet retailers selling a particular product. The programs troll the web for information and then "report" it back to the host site. Some of these sites also provide information on competitors' price, and may even ask customers to rate the various retailers they have listed to provide recommendations for other consumers to rate the varius retailers and which are less than desirable. We should note, however, that some sites do not wish to compete on price and don't give bot access. Emma, in her search for a personal computer, could visit ComputersCanada.com to quickly search computer prices across Canada. **The role of marketers during the information search phase of the decision process is to make sure that information about their brand is available when and where consumers look.** Most manufacturers make sure information about their newest models is on the web, is advertised frequently in dealer flyers and magazines, and of course, is available in deal showrooms
* Information search is often an ongoing process, and this stage may be more extensive and intensive for some consumers than others. It ends with identification of alternatives for consideration, called the consideration set.

## Evaluation of Alternatives
* Once consumers have identified the set of product they are interested in, they narrow down their choices by deciding which of all the possibilities are feasible and evaluating the remaining alternatives. Emma might want a top-of-the-line notebook, like Dell XPS, but she realizes that her student budget doesn't allow for such a purchase. As she looks around, she decides that the notebooks she likes in her price range are the Apple MacBook, the Compaq Presario, and the Gateway Solo. She has narrowed down her options by considering only affordable notebooks.
* Now, Emma has to choose. It's time for her to look mroe systematically at each of the three possibilities and identify the important characteristics, or evaluative criteria, she will use to decide among them. These may be the power of the computer, its weight, the size of the monitor, the battery life, the warranty offered, or even the computer's design or color options. During her evaluation, Emma learns that the Apple product, the MacBook, seem to her to have a lot of the features she is looking for. judging from the ad, it appears that it has all the great features of other notebooks, but with much greater speed.
* **Marketers often play a role in educating consumers about which product characteristics should be used as evaluative criteria--usually, they emphasize the dimensions in which their product excels. Where Compaq Presario might focus on price because it is one of the least expensive notebook computers available, Apple is educating consumers about the value of their new operating system.**

## Product Choice
* But how do consumers like Emma actually apply their evaluative criteria? Some consumers use **heuristics (mental short-cut)** to simplify the evaluation process--**taking the advice of someone else, buying the cheapest brand or the most expensive brand (assuming that price reflects quality), or buying the one that "feels" right (has the greatest emotional appeal)** Perhaps the most common heuristic is just buying the brand a consumer always buys--either through habit or through brand loyalty. Consumers are brand loyal when they make repeat brand purchase because they believe that brand is superior, have such strong preferences that they will pay more or search harder to find that brand, and feel that it's not worth the effort to consider competing options. The creation of brand loyalty is a prized goal for marketers. People form preferences for a favourite brand and then may literally never change their minds in the course of a lifetime, making it extremely difficult for rivals to persuade them to switch. Loyal customers are very valuable--as loyalty increases, consumers will buy at least twice as much as those who are just slightly less atteched to the brand, and often three to four times more. The most loyal customers can be worth up to 20 times more than other consumers. Some people take the concept of brand loyalty even further. At a recent lecture, Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide CEO Kevin Robers stressed his belief that the job of marketers is to "create loyalty beyond reason", to move their products and services "from being irreplaceable to irresistible" The success of the iPod illustrates this concept clearly--despite being critically viewed as not being the best MP3 availble, the iPod continues t o dominate the market.
* Many companies are now employing customer relationship management (CRM) strategies to help them organize and manage their relationship with their customers. CRM helps companies target their best customers and form ongoing relationships with them in the hope of increasing loyalty and improving customer satisfaction. CRM will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.
* Another heuristic that is often used by consumers is **based on country of origin**. We assume that a product has certain characteristics if it comes from a certain country. In the car category, many peoiple associate German cars with fine engineering and Swedish cars with safety.
* Other consumers put more thought into their purchase decision and have key criteria that absolutely have to be met. Emma, for example, is considering only laptop or notebook computers and is not willing to consider a desktop model. In doing so, she is applying a **non compensatory evaluation strategy**--where a consumer is unwilling to make trade-offs on product attributes such as getting a faster processor, more memory, and a larger hard drive for a lower price on a desktop computer. A compensatory strategy is where consumers are willing to make trade-offs to get the best overall deal (value) for their needs. There are different types of compensatory and non-compensatory strategies and many consumers use a mix of these strategies, even within the same decision process. These are summarized below

        Compensatry: 
                1. *Decision Rule:* Simple Additive, Sum the scores of each brand rating on each attribute, choose the brand with the highest overall score. 
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop brands with strong overall value; 2. Help consumers compare brands to make the overall value choice.
                
                2. *Decision Rule*: Weighted additive: give weights to each criteria, for each bran multiply the rating and the weight, sum the scores and choose the brand with the highest overall score.
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the criteria weights and design products that excel on those criteria. Position your product on the key criteria; 2. Try to change the weights of criteria to make them more or less important in the minds of customers--such as Intel did with the Intel Inside campaign

        Non-Compensatory: 
                1. *Decision Rule*: Lexicographic: Rank the decision criteria: evaluate the brands on the most important criteria. Choose the brand with the highest rating on the most important criteria. If there is a tie, go on to the next most important criteria until a brand is chosen
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the top three or four most important criteria for your target market and continuously innovate to lead on those criteria. 2. If you are not the leader, try to change consumer attitude about the importance of the criteria or try to get them to adopt a different evaluative strategy.

                2. Elimination by Aspects: Rank the decision criteria, and determine minimal acceptable levels for each criterion. Keep in the evoked set brands that meet the minimum level of the most important criteria. Go on to the next most important criteria until there is only one brand in the consideration set and choose that brand.
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the most important criteria for your target market and continuously innovate to be clsoe to the leader on the top criterion. 2. Try to establish a criterion in the minds of consumers where your commpetitors are not able to compete effectively. Demostrate that your brand exceeds typical minimum standard on key criteria

                3. *Decision Rule*: Conjunctive: Determine minimal acceptable levels for each criterion. Keep in your evoked set brands that meet or exceed the minimal level on all criteria. If there is a tie, add criteria or raise the minimum
                *Marketing Implication*: Understand the criteria and minimum levels. Continuously innovate to meet minimum levels on all criteria. Innovate to develop features or functions not provided by competitors. Try to establish these features or functions as criteria in the evaluation process.

        Heuristics 
                *Decision Rule*:Habit: Buy the brand you bought last time: Make your brand available; 
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop strong brand recognition; remind consumers that this is their brand

                *Decision Rule*: Price: Buy the cheapest or most expensive brand
                *Marketing Implication*: Innovate to keep a low cost structure and position your brand as the value leader--or position your brand as a premium brand and support the quality inference through marketing communication

                *Decision Rule*: Affect: Buy the brand that "feels" right
                *Marketing Implication*: Develop strong emotional connections to your brand through packaging and marketing communication

                *Decision Rule*: Recommendation: Buy the brand that someone says is best.
                *Marketing Implication*: Market to the opinion leaders and market mavens. Provide incentives or recognition for referrals.

* Emma has spent several weeks thinking about the alternatives, and she's finally ready to take the plunge and buy! After agonizing over her choice, she decides that, even though the Gateway and Dell laptops were rated highly by Consumer Reports, the Apple MacBook just feels right. It meets all the basic technical criteria and it appeals to her sense of individuality. The MacBook is the lighest of all the options and will easily fit in her backpack. She signs onto the Apple Canada website and buys her notebook computer. A few days later the computer arrives at her door. In the end, Emma used a mix of decision strategy (lexigraphic, conjunctive, and heruristics) to make her purchase decision

## Post-Purchase Evaluation
* In the last stage of decision making, the consumer evaluation the quality of the decision made. After mulling over the alternatives and picking one, they evaluate just how good a choice it was. Everyone has experience cognitive dissonance (regret, or buyer's remorse) after making a purchase and (hopefully) we have all been pleased with something we've bought. Marketers pay particular attention to cognitive dissonance, as they want consumers to have enduring positive attitude toward the brands they have purchased so they become loyal consumers--reducing the cost of marketing in the future and reducing the likelihood of the consumer switching to another brand. Cognitive dissonance is greatest when decisions are important and there are other viable brands in the consideration set. **Through marketing communication strategies that reaffirm consumers in what a good decision they made, marketers try to reduce or minimize cognitive dissonance.**
* The evaluation fo the product results in a level of consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction, which is determined by the overall feelings, or attitude, a person has about a product after purchasing it. In this case, fortunately, Emma's feelings couldn't be better. Her computer is reliable and easy to use, and its light weight means that she can easily carry it to her classes.
* Just how do consumers decide if they are satisfied with their purchases? One answer would be, "That's easy. The product is either wonderful, or it isn't" **However, it's a little more complicated than that. When consuemrs buy a prodcut, they have some expectation of product quality. How well a product or service meets or exceeds these expectations determines customer satisfaction. In other words, consumers assess product quality by comparing what they have bought to a performance standard created by a mixture of information from marketing communications, informal information sources such as friends and family, and their own experience with the product category.**
* So, even though Emma's new MacBook is not as powerful as some of the other options she considered, she's happy with her purchase because it meets or exceeds her expectations. Emma has completed the consumer decision making process by recognizing a problem, conducting an information search to resolve it, identifying the feasible alternatives, amking a product choice, and then evaluating the quality of her decision.

## OTHER DECISION PROCESSES
* **Emma's computer purchase was an example of a high-involvement, extended problem-solving decision that typically follows the process outlined above** But marketers know that not all consumer decisions are well researched and thought through. **Some people make emotional or affective (feeling-based) decisions like buying a car because it looks good, or buying a new dress because it's cute.** For example, Mazda Canada has recently tried to differentiate the company based on emotion--remaking their image from boring high-quality cars to fun, hip, and sporty high-quality cars--with "Zoom-Zoom". Other people make impulse decisions, acting without giving a lot of thought to the decision--grabbing a chocolate bar at a grocery checkout counter or deciding to play a video game after walking past an arcade.
* A framework developed by the Foote, Cone, and Belding advertising agency offers a useful way of looking at these different consumer decision processes. The FCB grid identifies thinking (cognition) and feeling (affect) as two primary approaches to consumer decision making, for both high- and low-involvement decisions. The four quadrants of the resulting 2 X 2 matrix represent four common decision appraoches: **informative decisions, affective decisions, habitual or responsive decisions, and sel-satisfaction or impulse decisions.** These approaches differ in the order in which consumers learn about brands (evaluate brands and establish beliefs), feel about brands (emotional response or attachment), and act to purchase brands. The extended problem-solving model is represented in Quadrant 1. **Decisions in this quadrant are made using rational thinking and extensive evaluation of alternatives using information and data.** The purchase of a new car or house would fall into this quadrant for most people. In Quadrant 2, consuemrs have emotional responses or attachments to brands and then learn enough about them to decide whether or not to buy them. Purchases in this qudrant are often made based on emotion rather than information. For many people the purchase of jewellery or other high-fashion apparel might fall into this quadrant. **In Quadrants 3 and 4, consumers act first, then evaluate or interpret (feeling) the outcomes.** While the FCB model has been criticized for being simplistic, not accounting for consumer experience, and not accounting well for negative emotions, **many marketers find it useful to include in segment profiles because of its strategy implications.** **Informative decisions (Quadrant 1), for example, are aided by marketers: providing specific and detailed information; providing product demonstrations; and making direct comparisons to alternatives. Other communication strategy implications will be discussed in Chapter 12 (Integrated Marketing Communication).**

## WHAT INFLUENCES CONSUMER DECISIONS?
As well as understanding the mechanics of the consumer decision-making process, marketers try to ascertain what influences in consumers' lives affect this process. There are three main categories: **internal, situational, and social influences**. In Emma's case, for example, the evaluative criteria she used to compare notebook computers and her feeling about each computer may have been influenced by such internal factors as **her desire to be unique, such situational factors as her satisfaction with the information and service provided on the Apple Canada website, and such social influences as her prediction that her friends would be impressed when they saw her taking notes in class on a new notebook computer.** Figure below shows the influences in the deicison-making process and emphasizes that all of these factors work toegether to affect the ultimate choice each person makes. Let's consider how each of these three types of influence works, starting with internal factors.

        Internal Influence: Perception, Motivation, Learning, Attitude, Personality, Age groups, Lifestyle
        Social Influence: Cultures, subculture, social class, group memberships
        Situational influence: physical environment, time
                                                                =====> Decision Process ====> PURCHASE

### Internal Influence on Consumer Decisions
* People associate the textures of fabrics and other surfaces with product qualities, and **some marketers are exploring how touch can be used in packaging to arouse consumer interest.** Some new plastic containers for household beauty items incorporate "soft touch" resins that provide a soft, frition-like resistance when held. Focus group members who tested one such package for Clairol's new Daily Defense shampoo described the sensations as "almost sexy" and were actually reluctant to let go of the containers. That's a powerful impact for a piece of plastic. Now we will examine how internal factors relating to the way people absorb and interpret information influence the decision-making process.
* **PERCEPTION**: Perception is the process by which people select, organize and interpret information from the outside world. We receive information in the form of sensations, the immediate response of our sensory receptors--eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and fingers--to such basic stimuli as light, color, and sound. Our impressions about products often are based on their physical qualities. We try to make sense of the sensations we receive by interpreting them in light of our past experiences. For example, Emma chose the Apple notebook computer partly because of its distinctive design, which she associates with style and individuality.
* **The perception process has important implications for marketers because, as consumers absorb and make sense of the vast quantities of information competing for their attention, it is likely that they won't notice any one marketing message.** And, if they do notice it, there's no guarantee that the meaning they give it will be quite the same one the marketer intended. **The issues that marketers need to understand during this process include *exposure, perceptual selection, and interpretation*.**
* Explosure: The stimulus must be within range of people's sensory receptors to be noticed. For example, **the lettering on a billboard must be big enough for a passing motorist to read easily, or the message will be lost.** Many people believe (falsely) that even messages they can't see will persuade them to buy advertised products. Claims about subliminal advertising, involving messages hidden in ice cubes, among other places, have been surfacing since the 1950s. Although many consumers believe in subliminal advertising and are convinced this technique can get them to buy things they do not really want, there is little evidence of its use or even evidence that this technique would work even if it were used. **Images that can be perceived are so effective that marketers really do not even consider subliminal effects.**
* Perceptual Selection: Consumers choose to pay attention to some stimuli but not to others. Consumers are more likely to be aware of messages that speak to their current needs. **A newspaper ad for a fast food restaurant that would go unoticed after lunch may grab your attention if you sneak a glance at  the paper during a class that ends at lunchtime.**
* Interpretation: Meaning is assigned to the stimulus. This meaning is influenced by prior associations the person has learned. The Benetton ad is a great example of how these assumptions alter our interpretations. Although the ad shows two men handcuffed to each other, some people assumed that the black man was cuffed to the white man, and the company was the target of many complaints about racisum after the ad appeared.
* **MOTVATION**: **Motivation is an internal state that drives us to satisfy needs. Once we activate a need, a state of tension exists that drives the consumer toward some goal that will reduce this tension by eliminating the need.** For example, Emma began to experience a gap between her present state--having to rely on the computers on campus--and a desired state--having a computer that allow her to work at home and on campus. The need for a new notebook computer was activated, which motivated Emma to test and learn about different models, to talk with friends about their experiences with notebook computers, and finally to buy a new notebook computer.

        Nikon Camera---"Feel like a Pro"            Self Actualization: Self-fulfillment, enriching experiences
        TELUS---"For the most important calls in the world--Yours"    Ego Needs: Prestige, status, accomplishment
        Molson---"True Canadian taste from Canada's oldest brewery"         Belonging: Love, friendship, acceptance by others
        Ombrelle Sunscree---"The sun protection most recommended by health professionals"   Safety: Security, shelter, protection
        Quaker Oat Bran---"It's the right thing to do"    Physiological: Water, sleep, food

* Psychologist Abraham Maslow developed an influential approach to motivation. Maslow formulated a hierarchy of needs, which categorizes motives according to five levels of importance, the more basic needs being on the bottom of the hierarchy and higher needs at the top. The hierarchy suggests that before a person can meet needs in a given level, they must first (at least partially) meet the needs in  the levels below. This approach shows individuals starting at the lowest level with basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter and then progress to higher levels to satisfy more complex needs, such as the need to be accepted by others or to feel good about themselves. Ultimately, people can reach t he highest-level needs and they will be motivated to attain such goals as spiritual fulfillment. As the figure above shows, **if marketers understand teh particular level of needs that is relevant to consumers in their target market**, they can tailor their product and messages to point out how these needs can be satisfied. In 1969 Clayton Alderfer proposed a revision to Maslow's need hierarchy based on empirical evidence (concern with basic material existence requirements), Relatedness (desire we have for maintaining interpersonal relationships), and Growth (intrinsic desire for personal development). He also recognized that more than one need may be motivational at the same time and that if higher order needs are not satisfied, people will compensate with satifying more lower order needs.
* **LEARNING**: Learning is a change in behaviour after gaining information or experience. Learning about products can occur deliberately, as when we set out to gather information about different MP3 players before buying one brand. We also learn even when we are not trying. Consumers recognize many brand names and can hum many product jingles, for example, even for products they do not use. Psychologists who study learning have advanced several theories to explain the learning process, and because a major goal for marketers is to "teach" consumers to prefer their products, these perspectives are important. In this section, we'll briefly review the most important perspectives on how people learn.
* Behavioural learning: Behavioural learning theories assume that learning takes place as the result of connections that form between events perceived by the individual. In one type of behavioural learning, *classical conditioning*, a person perceives two stimuli at about the same time. After a while, the person transfers his or her presonse from one stimulus to the other. **For example, an ad shows a product and a breathtaking beautiful scene, so that (the marketer hopes) you will transfer the positive feelings you get from looking at the scene to the advertised product.** Another common form of behavioural learning is called *operant conditioning*, which occurs when people learn that their actions result in rewards or punishments. This feedback influences how they will respond in similar situations in the future. Just as a rat in a maze learns the route to a piece of cheese, consumers who receive a reward, such as a prize in the bottom of a box of cereal, will be more likely to buy the brand again. The feedback acts as a reinforcement for the behaviour. Behaviour modification is similar to operant conditioning, only the reward is offered up front to encourage the desired behaviour.
* The learned associations in classical and operant conditioning, also have a tendency to transfer to other similar stimuli in a process called *stimulus generalization*. This means that the good or bad feelings associated with a product will "rub off" on other products that resemble it. **For example, some marketers create product line extension, in which new products share the name of an established brand so that people's good feeling about the current product will transfer to the new one. Dole, which is associated with fruit, was able t o introduce refrigerated juices and juice bar; Sun Maid branched out from raisins to raisin bread.**
* Cognitive learning: In contrast to behavioural theories of learning, cognitive learning theory views people as problem solvers who do more than passively react to associations between stimuli. Supporters of this viewpoint stress the role of creativity and insight during the learning process. One type of cognitive learning theory is *observational learning*, (also called vicarious learning), **which occurs when people watch the actions of others and note what happens to them as a result. They store these observations in memory and, at some later point, use the information to guide their own behaviour, especially when they admire or identify with these people in some way. Many promotional strategies centre on endorsements by movie stars, athletes, and music idols whose fans have observed their successes.**
* **ATTITUDES**: An attitude is a lasting evaluation of a person, object, or issue. Consumers have attitudes toward very product-specific behaviours, such as using Crest toothpaste rather than Colgate, as well as toward general consumption related behaviours, such as how often to brush one's teeth.
* A person's attitude has three commponents: affect, cognition, and behaviour. In a marketing context, affect is the overall feeling a person has about a product. Cognition is the beliefs and knowledge the person has about the product. Behaviour is what happens when the person takes action by buying or using the product.
* Depending on the nature of the product, one of these three components--feeling, knowing, or doing--will be the dominant influence in creating an attitude toward a product. **Affect** is usually **dominant for expensive products** that we use to say something about ourselves (such as perfume), in which the way the product makes us feel determines our attitude toward it. **Cognition** may be more important for **complex products, such as computers, which require us to process technical information.** Behaviour often determines attitudes for commonly purchased, low-involvement items, such as chewing gum, for which we often form an **attitude based simply on how the product tastes or performs**.
* **PERSONALITY**: Personality is the set of unique psychological characteristics that consistently influences the way a person responds to situations in the environment. One adventure seeking consumer may always be on the lookout for new experiences and cutting-edge products, while another is happiest in familiar surroundings, using the same brand repeatedly. To appeal to thrill seekers who like to break the rules, Isuzu positioned its Rodeo sport utility vehicle as a car that lets a driver break the rules. Advertising was created to support this idea by showing kids jumping in mud puddles, running with scissors, and coloring out the lines. For marketers, identifying difference in personality contribute value to crafting marketing strategies. Some specific characteristics, called personality traits, that are relevant to marketing strategies include **innovativeness, self-confidence, and sociability**
* Innovativeness: Innovativeness is the degree to which a person likes to try new things. Cutting-edge products, suchas radical new hairstyles and fashions, might appeal to innovative people
* Self-Confidence: Self-confidence is the degree to which a person has a positive evaluation of his or her abilities, including the ability to make a good product decision. People who don't have much self-confidence are good candidates for the services of image consultants, who assist in making the right choices.
* Sociability: Sociability is the degree to which a person enjoys social interaction. A social person might, for example, respond to entertainment-related products that cliam to bring people together or make parties more fun. 

* The notion that consumers buy products that are extensions of their personality traits make sense. Marketers try to create brand personalities to appeal to different types of consumers. The ad for Benjamin Moore paint, for example, position its brand of paint as a way of expressing personality and style.
* How we feel about our own personalities strong influence our purchasing decisions. We may buy a certain type of clothing statement about who we are. A person's self-concept is his or her attitude about the self. The self-concept is his or her attitude about the self. The self-concept is composed of a mixture of beliefs about one's abilities, observations of one's own behaviour, and feelings (usually both positive and negative) about one's personal attributes, such as body type or facial features. The extend to which a person's self-concept is positive or negative can influence the products he or she buys.
* In developing a new line of snack cake, Sara Lee found that consumers who had negative self-concept preferred portioned snack items because they felt they lacked the self-control to regulate how much they ate. **On the more positive side, self-esteem advertising attempts to stimulate positive feelings about the self. This technique is used by Kellogg's to position Special K cereal as a lifestyle choice.** Kellogg's attempts to counter negative self-esteem by making consumers feel good about themselves and feel good about the product, while promoting a healthy lifestyle. This message has recently been adapted to position Special K as part of a low-carb lifestyle. Dove's "Campaign for Real Beauty" centred around the belief that beauty could be relfected in different shapes, sizes, and ages. The brand's mission statement is "to make more women feel beutiful every day, by widening today's sterotypical view of beauty and inspiring women to take great care of themselves." The campaign was very successful and changed the way women defined beauty.

6. Consumers often buy products because they feel pressure from reference groups to conform. Does conformity exert a positive or negative influence on consumers? How do consumer demographics, psychographics, and lifestyles affect their readiness to conform? With what types of products is conformity more likely to occur?
7. Many Canadians and consumers around the globe use C2C e-commerce to supplement their incomes or as their primary source of income. What do you think of the future of sites such as eBay? What opportunities does eBay provide for twenty-first-century entrepreneurs?

Marketing Practice: Applying What You've Learned
1. Assume that you are the director of marketing for a chain of camping and outdoor gear stores. Your firm is expanding and it is your job to develop general recommendations for store design. Prepare a summary of your recommendations for store design elements that you believe will provide the best shopping environment for your customers
2. Assume that you are an account executive with an advertising agency. Your current client is a firm that makes swimwear. You know that swimwear purchases are often influenced by a variety of social or "other people" factors. Write a report that list these social influences, explain why each is important, and outline how you might use these influence in developing an advertising campaign.
3. This chapter indicated that consumers go through a series of steps (from problem recognition to post-purchase evaluation) as they make purchases. Write a detailed report describing what you would do in each of these steps when deciding to purchase one of the following product

        a. an automobile
        b. a suit
        c. a vacation

4. Sometimes advertising or other marketing activities cause problem recognition to occur by showing consumers how much better off they would be with a new product or by pointing out problems with products they already own. For the following product categories, what are some ways in which marketers might try to stimulate problem recognition?

        a. cellphone
        b. toothpaste
        c. vitamins
        d. fast food

5. You work for a firm that markets frozen foods and are concerned about the effects of current consumer trends, including the increasingly diverse ethnic makeup of the population, changing roles of men and women, increased concern for time and for the environment, and decreased emphasis on owning status goods. Others in your firm do not understand or care about these changes. They believe that the firm should continue to do business just as it always has. Develop a role-playing exercise with a classmate to discuss these two different points of view for your class. Each of you should include the importance of each of these trends to your firm and your suggestions for marketing strategies to address these trends

Marketing Mini-Project Learning by Doing
* The purpose of this mini-project is to increase your understanding of the roles of personal, social, and situational factors in consumer behaviour.
1. With several other members of your class, select one of the following product categories (or some other product of your choice)

        a. perfume
        b. computers
        c. women's or men's shoes
        d. automobile

2. Visit three stores or locations where the product may be purchased (try to select three thatare very differernt from each other). Observe and make notes on all the elements of each retail environment.
3. At each of the three locations, observe people purchasing the product. Make notes about their characteristics (e.g., age and sex) and their actions in the store in relation to the product
4. Prepare a report for your class describing the situation variables and individual consumer differences you discovered and how they relate to the purchase of the product.
5. Present your findings to your class.

# CHAPTER 6: Organizational Buying Behaviour

## BUSINESS MARKETS: BUYING AND SELLING WHEN STAKES ARE HIGH
* You might think most marketers spend their days dreaming up the best way to promote cutting edge web browsers or funky shoes. Not so. Many marketers know that the "real action" is more likely to be found in lead pipes, offcie supplies, safety shoes, meat lockers, or machine tools. In fact, some of the most interesting and most lucrative jobs for young marketers are in industries you probably have never heard of.
* An individual consumer may decide to buy two or three T-shirts at one time, each emblazoned with a different design. Large companies such as Canadian Tire, Petro-Canada, Air Canada, and Cirque du Soleil buy hundreds, even thousands, of employee uniforms embroidered with their corporate logos in a single order. Like an end consumer, a business buyer makes decisions--with an important difference. The purchase may be worth millions of dollars, and both the buyer and seller have a lot at stake in making a wise decision.
* In this chapter, we'll look at the big picture of the business marketplace, in which the fortunes of business buyers and sellers can hang in the balance of a single transaction. Then we'll examine how marketers categorize businesses and organiations to develop effective business marketing strategies. Finally, we'll look at business buying behaviour and the business buying decision process. 
* To begin, consider these transactions: Moosehead Breweries, Canada's oldest independent brewery, sells its beer (such as Moosehead Lager) directly to food and beverage retailers and distributors. Procter & Gamble sells cases of Tide to RC Distributors, a Northern Ontario wholesaler. The Stratford Festival buys costumes, sets, and programs. Merck Frosst plans to purchase 1000 Dell computer systems for employee home use. BC Gas buys advice from Anderson Consulting. The Winnipeg Public Library buys a Canon copier. Rona buys drywall from the Canadian Gypsum Company.

## Characteristics That Make a Difference in Business Markets
* All of these market activities have one thing in common--they are part of business-to-business marketing. This is the marketing of goods and services that businesses and other organizational customers buy for some purpose other than personal consumption. Firms may resell these goods and services or may use them to produce still other goods and services to sell to other businesses or to support their own operations. Business-to-business customers include manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and a variety of other organizations such as hospitals, colleges and universities, and government agencies. Another name for business-to-business markets is organizational markets.
* Business customers create vast opportunities for marketers. When measured in dollars, the market for business and organizational goods and services is four times larger than the consumer market.
* To put the size and complexity of business markets into perspective, let's consider a single product--a pair of jeans. A consuemr may browse through several racks of jeans and ultimately purchase a single pair, but the store at which the consuemr shops has purchased many pairs of jeans in different sizes, styles, and brands from different manufacturers. Each of these manufacturers purchases fabrics, zippers, buttons, and thread from other manufacturers that, in turn, puchase the raw materials to make these components. In addition, all the firms in this chain need to purchase equipment, electricity, labour, computer systems, office supplies, packing materials, and countless other goods and services. So, even a single purchase of the latest style of Diesel jeans is the culmination of a series of buying and selling activities among many organizations--many people have been keeping busy while you're out shopping.
* In theory, the same basic marketing principles hold in both comnsumer and business markets--firms identify customer needs and develop a marketing mix to satisfy those needs. For example, imagine the company that made the desks and chairs in your classroom. Just like a firm that markets consumer goods, **the classroom furniture company first must create an important competitive advantage for its target market of colleges and universities.** Next the firm develops a marketing mix strategy beginning with a product--classroom furniture that will withstand years of use by thousands of students while providing a level of comfort required of a good learning environment. The firm must offer the furniture at prices the school will pay and must develop a sales force or other marketing commnication strategy to make sure your school (and hundreds of others) consider--and hopefully choose--its products when furnishing classrooms. Although marketing to business customers does have a lot in common with consumer marketing, there are differences that make this basic process more complex. 


| Organizational Markets  | Consumer Markets  |
|---|---|
| Purchases made for some purpose other than personal consumption  | Purchase for individual or household consumption  |
| Purchases made by someone other than the user of the product  | Purchase usually made by ultimate user of the product   |
| Decision frequently made by several people  | Decision usually made by individuals  |
| Purchase made according to precise technical specifications based on product expertise  | Purchases often made based on brand reputation or personal recommendations with little or no product expertise  |
| Purchases made after careful weighing of alternatives  | Purchases frequently made on impulse  |
| Purchases made based on rational criteria  | Purchases made based on emotional responses to products or promotions  |
| Purchasers often engage in lengthy decision process  | Individual purchasers often make quick decisions  |
| Interdependencies between buyers and sellers; long-term relationships  | Buyers engage in limited-term or one-time only relationships with many different sellers |
| Purhcases may involve competitve bidding, price negotiations, and complex financial arrangements  | Most purchases made at "list price" with cash or credit cards  |
| Product frequently purchased directly from producer  | Products usually purchased from someone other than producer of the product  |
| Purchases frequently involve high risk and high cost  | Most purchases are low risk and low cost  |
| Limited number of large buyers  | Many individual or household customers  |
| Buyers often geographically concentrated in certain areas  | Buyers generally dispersed throughout total population  |
| Product: often complex; classified based on how organizational customers use them  | Products: consumer goods and services for individual use  |
| Demand derived from demand for other goods and services, generally inelastic in the short run, subject to fluctuations, and may be joined to the demand for other goods and services  | Demand based on consumer needs and preferences, is generally price elastic, steady over time, and independent of demand for other products  |
| Promotion emphasizes personal selling  | Promotion emphasize advertising  |

* **MULTIPLE BUYERS** In busienss markets, **product often have to do more than satisfy an individual's needs. They must meet the requirements of everyone involved in the company' purchase decision.** If you decide to buy a new chair for your room or apartment, you are the only one who has to be satisfied. For your classroom, the furniture must satisfy students, faculty members, administrators, campus planners, and the purchasing department. Instead of simply deciding on an appropriate price for the product, business-to-business marketers frequently must submit written quuotes stating their prices and then hope a competitor doesn't submit a lower quote.
* **NUMBER OF CUSTOMER**: Compared to consumers, organizational customers are few and far between. In Canada, there are about 10 million consumer households but fewer than 50,000 busiensses and organizations. Unless your name is Bronfman or Gates, each organizational buyer has more to spend than you do as an individual consumer. Business marketers have a narrow customer base and a small number of buyers. Kodak's business division, which markets sophisticated medical products to hospitals and other medical groups, has a limited number of potential customers compared with its consumer film division.
* **SIZE OF PURCHASES** Business-to-business products can dwarf consumer purchases, both in the qunatity of items ordered and in the price of individual purchases. A company that supplies uniforms to other business, for example, buys hundreds of large drums of laundry detergent each year in contrast to a consumer household that buys one box of detergent every few weeks. Organizations purchase some products (e.g., highly sophisticated pieces of manufacturing equipment, computer-based marketing information systems) that can cost into the millions of dollars. For example, DALSA, which specializes in the design and manufacture of sophisticated electronic cameras, sells charge-coupled devices for $50,000. Recognizing such differences in the size of purchases allows marketers to meet business customers' needs. Although it makes perfect sense to use mass-media advertising to sell laundry detergent to consumers, **selling thousands of dollars worth of laundry detergent or a million-dollar computer is best handled by a strong personal sales force.**
* **GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION** Another difference between business markets and consuemr markets is geographic concentration--many business customers are located in a small geographic area rather than spread out across the country. Consumers buy and use products like toothpaste and televisions whether they live in the heart of Toronot or in a small fishing village on Price Edward island. This is not true for business-to-business customers, who may be exclusively located in a single region of the country. In Canada, much of the industrial buying power is concentrated in Toronto, Montreal, and Calgary, where major Canadian corporations have their head offices.

## Business-to-Business Demand
* Demand in business markets differs from consumer demand. Most demand for business-to-businessproducts is derived, inelastic, fluctuating, and joint. Understanding these differences in business-to-business demand is important for marketers in forecasting sales and in planning effective marketing strategies.
* **DERIVED DEMAND** Consumer demand is a direct connection between a need and the satisfaction of that need. Business customers don't purchase goods and services to satisfy their own needs. Business-to-business demand is **derived demand**, because **a business's demand for goods and services comes either directly or indirectly from consumer's demand**. For example, the demand for building products such as Canadian Gypsum's drywall or a sony home entertainment centre is derived from the demand for new hommes and luxury goods. Retailers buy goods to resell in response to consumer demand while other organizatinos and firms buy products that are used to produce still more goods and services that consumer markets demand.
* Consider example below. Demand for forestry products comes from the demand for pulp to make paper used to make textbooks. The demand for textbooks comes from the demand for education. **As a result of derived demand, the success of one company may depand on another company in a different industry. The derived nature of business demand means that marketers must be constantly alert to changes in consumer trends that ultimately will have an effect on business-to-business sales.**
* **INELASTIC DEMAND** The demand for business or organizatinoal product is generally inelastic. Inelastic demand means that, regardless of whether the price of a business-to-business product goes up or down, customers will buy the same quantity. (The notion of price elasticity in discussed further in Chapter 9). We see inelastic demand in business-to-business markets because an individual busienss product is usually one of the many parts and materials that go into producing the consuemr product. **It is not unusual for a large increase in price for a single business product to have little effect on the price of the final consumer product.** For example, the BMW sells for about $75,000. To produce the car, BMW purchases thousands of different parts. If the price of tires, batteries, or steros goes up--or down--BMW will still buy enough t o meet consumer demand for its cars. As you might imagine, increasing the price of a $75,000 car by $30 or $40 or even $1000 won't change consumer demand
* Business-to-business demand isn't always inelastic. Sometimmes producing a consuemr good or service relies on only one or a few materials or component parts. If the price of the part increases, demand may become elastic if the manufacturer of the consumer good passes the increase on to the consumer. Steel, for example, is a large component of automobiles. **If the price of steel goes up, automobile manufacturers will pay a lot more for a necessary component of their product. An increase in the price of steel can drive up the price of automobiles so much that consumer demand for them drops, decreasing the demand for steel.**
* **FLUCTUATING DEMAND** Considering that demand comes from the end consumer, even small changes can create large increases or decreases in business demand. The acceleration principle (also called the multiplier effect) explains how a small percentage change in consumer demand can create a large percentage change in total industrial or business demand. Consider, for example, a 5 percent increase in consumer demand for air travel. If the airlines are already filling their flights, they may decide to buy new planes to meet the increased consumer demand. For Boeing or Bombardier Aerospace, the orders for new planes may double or even triple the normal demand.
* A product's life expectancy is another reason for fluctuating demand. Business cusomers tend to purchase certain products (e.g, large machinery) infrequently, perhaps only every 10 or 20 years. Thus, demand for such products fluctuates; it may be very high one year when customers' machines are wearing out but low the following year because the old machinery is working fine.
* Changes in a company's inventory policies can also create demand fluctuations. Consider a firm that has historically kept a 30 day supply of parts. Operations managers may decide to keep a 14-day supply of parts to reduce costs. Demand for the part will first go down because the manager will be placing a smaller order (for 14 days) and then level off at that 14-day quantity
* **JOINT DEMAND** Joint demand is the result of two or more goods being necessary to create a product. For example, General Motors requires tires, batteries, and spark plugs. If the supply of one of these products decreases, General Motors will be unable to manufacture as many automobiles and will not buy as many of the other items. Therefore, the sale of B.F. Goodrich tires to General Motors partly depands on the availability of batteries and spark plugs, even though the tire manufacturer has nothing to do with these products.

## CLASSIFYING BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETS
* Many firms buy products in business markets **so that they can produce other goods in turn**. Many of the Candian Gymsum Company's customers are contractors who build homes and offcies and sell them to families and organizations. Other business-to-business customers **resell, rent, or lease goods and services**. Still others, such as the Red Cross, provincial governments, and local churches, serve the public in some way. As Figure below, these distinctions lead to broad categories: producers, resellers, and organizations. For business marketers, the classification of firms is significant because it identifies firms that purchase similar products and that have similar buying practices. This identification helps marketers develop strategies that effectively target different organizational customers.


        Total Business Market:
                
                Producers: Fishing, agricultural, and lumber industries | Manufacturers of consumer goods and conponent parts | Services, including financial, transportation, restaurants, hotels, health care, recreation and entertainment, and others

                Resellers: Wholesalers and distributors | Retailers

                Organizations: Government, including federal, provincial, county, and local units | Not-for-profit institutions, including organizations with education, charity, community and other public service goals

* One tool that firms use is the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This is a numerical coding system for classifying industries, and was developed jointed by the United States, Canada, and MExico. NAICS replaced the U.S. Standard Industrial classification (SIC) system in 2002 so that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) member nations could compare economic and financial statistics. like the SIC system, the NAICS is **used to collect and report data on business activity such as the number of firms, the  total dollar amount of sales, the number of employees, and the growth rate for industries--broken down by geographic region. These report have become an essential tool for classifying business-to-business customers.** Many firms use them to assess potential markets and to determine how well they are doing compared to their industry group as a whole.
* The NAICS uses a different six-digit numerical code for each industry. At its inception, the system included 20 major sectors identified by two-digit numbers. The major sectors are further broken down into subsectors (third digit), industry group (fourth digit), industries commmon to Canada, the United States, and Mexico (fifth digit), and data related to the industry in a specific country (six digit--"0" for Canada). The system is updated every five years to allow classifications to keep up with changes in the economy.
* **To use the NAICS to find new customers, a marketer might first determine the NAICS groups of current customers and then evaluate the sales potential of the overall NAICS groups or particular segments based on the number of employees of firms in the group. For example, a firm that supplies employee uniforms could evaluate the sales potential of firms having 150 and 1000 employees in an NAICS category and set its sights on attractive firms in that category.** In other cases, a firm might choose to target firms in a cross-section of categories, as Sprint did it its "Real Solution" campaign which was aimed at all companies that employed 100 to 500 people. Now we will take a closer look at the four major categories into which organizations fall.
* **PRODUCERS** Producers pruchase goods for use in the production of other goods and services that are, in turn, sold to make a profit. **Producers are customers for a vast number of products, from raw materials to goods manufactured by other producers**. For example, DuPont buys resins and use them to manufacture insulation material for sleeping bags. Ontario mould maker Protoplast buys aluminum ingots, which it turns into industrial moulds. Auto manufacturers, such as Honda or Ford, buy a variety of component parts--from transmissions to carpet--for use in teh cars they ship to consumers. Service producers buy linens, furniture, and food to create the quality accommodations and meals their guests expect.
* **RESELLERS** Resullers buy finished goods for the purpose of reselling, renting, or leasing to other businesses. Resellers include retailers and wholesalers. Bestfoods, for example, sells its food products to the distribution arms of giant resellers such as Loblaws, Sobeys, A&P, and Safeway, who then distribute the food to their retail stores. **Although resellers do not produce goods, they do provide their customers with the time, place, and possession utility** we talked about in Chapter 1 by making the goods available to consumers when and where they want them.
* **GOVERNMENT** Government markets make up the largest single business or organizational market in Canada. The Canadian government market includes more than 6000 government agencies and organizations, more than 740 municipal and local governments, 10 provincial governments, 3 territorial governments, and a federal government that collectively spent more than $515 million in 2006. The deferal government alone has more than 225 separate institutions that typically procure $5 to $6 million worth of goods and services each year.
* Governments are just about the only customers for certain products such as snowplows, garbage trucks, transit buses, and light rapid trains. Many government expenditures are for more familiar and less expensive items, such as printer toner, pens, and Post-it Notes. The Vancouver Whistler 2010 olympic organization committe, for example, will be spending more than $20 million to set up offices and the athletes village--buying products ranging from office equipments to beds and pillows.
* For busienss marketers, selling goods and services to governments is different from selling to producer or reseller markets. Taking a prospective buyer to lunch may be standard practice in the corporate world, but in government markets, this practice may be in conflict with ethical (and legal) standards for government personnel. Because governments make purchases with taxpayer money, law require them to adhere to strict regulations. Generally, government buyers must develop detailed specifications and obtain competitve bids for even the simplest purchases. With competitive bids, potential suppliers must submit detailed proposals including price and associated data for a proposed purchase. The firm making the best offer gets t he bid. Government agencies are often required by law to accept the lowest bid from a qualified vendor.
* Government regularly publish information on upcoming bidding opportunities to let possible vendors know about purchases they are about to make. In Canada, the deferal government's tendering process is managed by a private comapny call MERX, which offers a website for searching and submitting tenders for government procurement opportunities with a value of $25000 or more (www.merx.com). MERX also gives companies access to thousands of other procurement opportunities from provincial and municipal government as well as hundreds of colleges, universities, hospitals, and school boards across Canada.
* **Not-for-Profit Institution** Not-for-profit institutions are organizations (for example, hospitals, churches, colleges, universities, museums, nursing homes) that operate for charitable eductional, community, and other public service goals and buy goods and services to support these functions. The institutional market also includes charitable and cause-related organizations, such as the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. Not-for-profit institutions tend to operate on low budget and, in all but the largest ones, non-professional part-time buyer who have other duties--or are volunteers--normally make the purchases. These customers often rely on marketers to provide more advice and assistance before and after the sale than professional business buyers require.

## THE NAUTRE OF BUSINESS BUYING
* So far we've talked about how busienss-to-business markets are different from consumer markets and about the different types of customers that make up business markets. In this section, we'll discuss some of the important characteristics of business buying.
* To be successful in business-to-business markets means developing marketing strategies that meet the needs of organizational customers better than the competition. **To do this, marketers must understand busienss buying behaviour.** Armed with this knowledge, marketers are able to participate in the buyer's decision process from the start. Take a firm that sells equipment to hospitals. Understanding that physicians (rather than buyers) who practice at the hospital often initiate decisions to purchase new equipment means that the firm's salespeople will make sure the physicians know about new technologies and improved equipment. In this section, we'll first look at the different types of buying situations found in business markets. Then we'll examine the role of professional purchasers and buying centres in business buying.

### The buying Situation
* Like end consumers, business buyers spend more time and effort on certain purchases than on others. Devoting such effort to a purchase decision often depends on the commplexity of the product and how often the decision has to be made. A **buy class** identifies the degree of effort required of the firm's personnel to collect information and make a purchase decision. These classes are **straight rebuys modified rebuys, and new-task buys**.
* **STRAIGHT REBUY** *Buyers, when a purchase has low risk, often rely on strategies to simplify the process, such as using a fixed set of trusted suppliers for routine purchases. Products like computer paper, shipping cartons, and cleaning compounds are low risk*. **Being successful in such markets means keeping prices down and developing selling policies to keep the buying process as simple as possible**. A straight rebuy is the purchase of items that a business-to-business customer regularly needs. The buyer has purchased the same items many times before and routinely reorders them when supplies are low, often from the same suppliers. Reordering takes little time. Buyers typically maintain a list of approved vendors that have demonstrated their ability to meet the firm's criteria for pricing, quality, service, and delivery.
* Because straight rebuys **can mean steady income for a firm, many business marketers go to great lengths to cultivate and maintain relationships with customers that will lead to straight rebuys.** Salespeople, for example, regularly call on these customers to personally handle orders and to see if there are additional products the customer needs; they many also attempt to obtain long-term contracts. **Rebuys keep a supplier's sales volume up and selling costs down.**
* **MODIFIED REBUY** Straight rebuy situations do not last forever. A modified rebuy occurs when a firm wants to shop around for suppliers with better prices, quality, or delivery times. A modified rebuy can also occur when an organization has purchased many copying machines in the past, for example, may have to evaluate several lines of equipment, such as a document centre, if the firm has a new need for digitized office equipment.
* **NEW-TASK BUYING** A first time purchase is a new-task buy, often characterized by **uncertainty and risk**. new-task buys **require the most effort because the buyer has no previous experience on which to base a decision.** Companies like Vancouver-based FatPort are selling Wi-Fi network hubs to pubs, laundroamats, independent hotels, and other small businesses, helping them become wireless Internet service providers. This technology allows different devices and people to communicate with each other through radio frequencies. **Most small business owners have little experience with wireless commjunication technology making this a new-task purchase decision that comes with some risk and a lot of uncertainty.** In new-task buying situations, buyers not only lack experience with the product, but are also unfamiliar with firms that supply the product. Supplier choice is therefore critical and buyers will gather much information about quality, pricing, delivery, and service from several potential suppliers.
* For suppliers, new-task buying represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Although a new-task buy can be significant in itself, many times the chosen supplier gains the added advantage of becoming an "in" supplier for more routine purchases that will follow. A growing business that needs an advertising agency for the first time, for example, may seek exhaustive information from several firms before selecting one and will continue to use the chosen agency's services for future projects without exploring other alternatives. **Marketers kknow that to get the order in a new-task buy situations, they must develop a close working relationship with the business buyer. Such relationships mean that buyers can count on busienss marketers to help develop product specifications and terms for the purchase that are in the best interests of the customer's organization and its needs.

### The professional Buyer
* Just as it is important for marketers of consumer goods and services to understand their customers, it is essential that business-to-business marketers understand who handles the buying for business customers. **Trained professional buyers typically carry out buying in business-to-business markets and are often called purchasing agents, procurement officers, or directors of material management.** Unlike consumers who may spend only a few hours a month making purchase decisions, professional purchasers do it all day, every day.
* Professional buyers have a lot of responsibility. They spend the commpany's money and buy the product that keep it running. These buyers tend to focus on economic factors beyond the **inital price of the product, including transportation and delivery charges, accessory products or supplies, maintainence, and other ongoing costs. They select suppliers, negotiate for the lowest prices, and are responsible for selecting quality products and ensuring their timely delivery. Their purchases can range in price and significance from paper clips to *multimillion-dollar computer systems*.**
* Sometimes busienss buyers, like consumers, make decisions based on emotions, brand loyalty, long-term relationships established with particular salespeople, or aesthetic concerns. Even age, income, education, personalities, and attitudes can affect a buyer's decisions. Marketing communications play a crucial role in the buyer's decision process. **For example, most buyers depend on vendor's salespeople to keep them informed of new prodcuts.**
* **A key factor** in many purchase deicisons is whether the buyer perceives the **purchase to be risky**. Some buyers are more risk averse than others. **Successful busienss marketers try to develop strategies that help the buyer avoid risk. These include providing samples of a new product for a business customer or placing a new piece of equipment in the customer's facility to try for a few weeks.
* Big firms with many facilities in different locations often practice **centralized purchasing**. This means that, *even when others in the organization participate in the decision of what to buy, one department does all the buying for the company.* With centralized purchasing, a firm has more buying power and can get the best prices. Wal-mart Canada can offer its customers lower prices than other stores, because its centralized purchasing department buy large quantities of items and can demand volume discounts from suppliers. For sellers such as Kraft Food, centralized purchasing means they only need to make a single sale to have their peanut butter in Sobeys/IGA locations across the country.
* The professional buyers who work in centralized purchasing offices often become experts at the ins and outs of certain types of products, and each may have a specialized role in the purchasing function. In the buying departments of retail chains, for example, an individual buyer (and several assitant buyers) may be responsible for buying only women's sleepwear or junior tops or children's sizes 2 to 6X. This specializing leads to greater expertise in the buyer's specific area.

### The Buying Centre
* Whether or not a firm's buying is a centralized process and whether or not the purchase situation calls for a modified or new-task buying situation, several people may need to work together to reach a decision. Depending on what they need to purcahse, these participants may be production workers, supervisors, engineers, secretaries, shipping clerks, or financial officers. In a small organization, everyone may have a voice in teh decision. The group of people in the organization who particpate in the decision-making process is the buying centre
* **THE FLUID NATURE OF THE BUYING CENTRE** Although the term buying centre may conjure up an image of offices buzzing with purchasing activity, it usually is a cross-functional team of decision makers. Generally, the members of a buying centre have some expertise of interest in the particular decision and they are able, as a group, to make the best decision.
* Hospitals, for example, frequently make purchase deicisions through a large buying contre. When making a decision to purchase disposable oxygen masks, for example, **one or more physicans, the director of nurses, and purchasing agents may work together to determine quantities and select the best products and suppliers. A separate decision regarding the types of pharmaceutical supplies to stock might need a different group to advise the purchasing agent. This means that marketers must continually identify which employees are involved in every purchase and develop relationship with them all.
* **ROLES IN THE BUYING CENTRE** Buying centre participants have unique roles in teh decision process. In some cases, the purchasing agent or professional buyer who makes the purchase may also make the decision. in other cases, the buyer's chief role is to gather information for users of the product or a top manager who will ultimately make the decision.
* For supplier, the buying centre concept complicates the marketing process. A salesperson, for example, may have to provide different types of information to satisfy the interests of all participants. **For example, a customer's engineers may want to know about the technical specifications of the product, whereas managers who will oversee the use of the product are interested in the safety of the product or in what types of in-service training the supplier is willing to provide.** The salesperson also has to **determine who has the most influence on the decision, who plays the key role of decision maker, and who actually makes the purchase**. Consider again the hospital purchase of oxygen masks. The purchasing department's major concerns likely centre on price and delivery schedules, the nursing staff may be interested in packaging that is easy to open, and the physicans may be concerned with product design and that there will be few, if any, faulty masks. The salesperson must ***convince*** everyone that his or her product will satisfy their needs better than that of the competition.
* The initiator begins the buying process by first recognizing that the firm needs to make a purchase. A production employee, for example, may notice that a piece of equipment is not working properly and notify a supervisor. At other times, the initiator may suggest purchasing a new product because it will improve the firm's operatinos. Depending on the initiator's position in the organization and the type of purchase, the initiator may or may not influence the actual purchase decision. **For marketers, it is important to make sure individuals who might initiate a purchase are aware of improved product they offer.**
* The user is the member of t he buying centre who needs the purchased product. The user's role in the buying centre vaires. For example, an administrative assistant may give his or her input on the features needed in a new copier that the assistant will be "chained to" for several hours a day. **Marketers need to inform users of their products about ease of use and other user benefits their products provide over those of competitors.**
* The gatekeeper is the member who controls the flow of information to other members. **Typically, the gatekeeper is the purchasing agent who gathers information and materials from salespeople, schedules sales presentations, and control suppliers' access to other participants in the buying process.** For salespeople, developing and maintaining strong personal relationships with gatekeepers is critical to being able to offer their products to the buying centre.
* An influencer affects the buying decision by dispensing advice or sharing expertise. By virtue of their expertise, **engineers, quality control specialists, and other technical experts** in the firm generally have a great deal of influence in purchasing equipment, materials, and component parts used in production. The influencers may or may not wind up using the product. **Marketers need to identify key influencers in the buying cnetre and work to convince them of their product's superiority.**
* The decider is the member of the buying centre who makes the final decision. This person usually has the greatest power within the buying centre and often has power within the organization to authoize spending the commpany's money. For a routine purchase, the decider may be the purchasing agent. if the purchase is complex, a manager or CEO may be the decider. The decider is key to a marketer's success and deserves a great deal of attention in the selling process.
* The buyer is the person who has responsibility for executing the purchase. Although the buyer often has a role in identifying and evaluating alternative suppliers, this person's primary function is handling teh details of the purchase. The buyer obtain competing bids, negotiates contracts, and arranges delivery dates and payment plans. Once a firm makes the purchase decision, marketers turn their attention to negotiating the details of the purchase with the buyer. Successful marketers are well aware that providing exemplary service in this stage of the purchase can be key to future sales.

## THE BUSINESS BUYING DECISION PROCESS
* We have seen a number of players in the business buying process, beginning with an initiator and ending with a buyer. To make matters more challenging to maketers, members of the buying team go through several stages in teh decision-making process. The business buying decision process, as figure below, is a series of steps similar to those in the consumer decision process (previous chapter). The busienss buying process is mroe complex than the consuemr decision-making process, however, and each step can mushroom into several additional steps.

### Problem Recognition
* As in consumer buying, **the first step in the business buying decision process occurs when someone sees that a purchase can solve a problem.** For straight rebuy purchases, this step may be a result of the firm running out of paper, pens, or garbage bags. **In thse cases(rebuy), the buyer places the order and the decision-making process ends**. Recognition of the need for **modifed rebuy purchases often comes from wanting to replace outdated equipment, from changes in technology, or from an ad, brochure, or other form of marketing communication that offers the customer a better product at a lower price.** The need for new-task purchases often arises **because the firm wants to enhance its operations in some way or a smart salesperson tells the busienss customer about a new product that will increase the efficiency of the firm's operations.**
* **INFORMATION SEARCH** In the second step of the decision process for purchases other than straight rebuys, the buying centre searches for information about product and suppliers. Members of the buying centre may individually or collectively refer to reports in trade magazines and journals, seek advice from outside consultants, and pay close attention to marketing communication from different manufacturers and other suppliers. As in consumer marketing, marketers ensure the information is available when and where business customers want it--by placing ads in trade magazines, mailing brochures and other printed material to prospects, and having a well-trained, enthusiastic sales force regularly calling on customers
* **DEVELOPING PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS** Business buyers often develop product specifications, written descriptions laying out theri exact product requirements--**quality, size, weight, color, features, quantities, warranty, serice term, and delivery and training requirements** for the purchase. When the product needs are complex or technical, engineers and other experts are key players in identifying specific product characteristics and determining whether standardized, off-the-shelf or customized, made-to-order goods and services will do.
* **OBTAINING PROPOSALS** Once the product specifcations are in hand, the buyer's next step is to obtain written or verbal proposals, or bids, from one or more potential suppliers. For standardized or branded products in which there are few, if any, differences in the products of different suppliers, this may be as simple as an informal request for pricing information, including discounts, shipping charges, and confirmation of delivery dates. At other times, the request is a formal written request for proposal or request for quotation, which requires suppliers to develop detailed proposals or price quotations for supplying the product.

### Evaluation of Alternatives
* When evaluating alternatives, the buying centre assesses the proposal. Total spending for goods and services can have a major impact on the firm's profitability, **so all other things being equal, price is the primary consideration**. Pricing evaluations take into account **discount policies for certain quantities, returned goods policies, the cost of repiar and maintenance services, terms of payment, and the cost of financing large purchases. For capital equipment, cost criteria also include the life expectancy of the purchase, the expected resale value, and disposal costs for old equipment.** In some cases, **the buying centre may negotiate with the preferred supplier to match the lowest bidder** Although a bidder often is selected because it offers the lowest price, th buying decision may be based on other factors. For example, American Express wins bids for its travel agency busienss by offering extra services such as a corporate credit card and monthly reports that detail the company's total travel expenses.
* The more complex and costly the purchase, the more time spent searching for the best supplier--and the more marketers must do to win the order. For example, marketers often make formal presentatinos and product demonstration to the buying centre group. In the case of installations and large equipment, marketers sometimes arrange for buyers to speak with or even visit other customers to see for themselves how the product perform.

### Product and Supplier Selection
* Once buyers have assessed all proposals, they make a purchase decision--the selection of the best product and supplier to meet the firm's needs. Although price is usually a factor, in firms that have adopted a total quality management approach (discussed next chapter), **the quality, reliability, and durability of materials and component parts are paramount.** Reliability and durability rank high for equipment and systems that keep the firm's operation running smoothly without interruption. **For some purchases, warranties, repair service, and regular maintenace after the sale are important.**
* A supplier' ability to make on-time deliveries is the critical factor in the selection process for firms that have adopted an inventory management system called just in time (JIT). JIT system reduce inventory and stock to very low levels (or even zero) and ensure a constant supply through precisely timed deliveries just when needed. For both manufacturers and resellers, the choice of supplier may come down to one whose location is nearest. To win a large customer, a supplier organization may even have to be willing to set up production facilities close to the customer to guarantee JIT delivery.
* One of the most important functions of a buyer is deciding how many suppliers can best serve the firm's needs. Sometimes one supplier is more beneficial to the organization than multiple suppliers. Sinle sourcing in which a buyer and seller work quite closely, is particulrly important for a firm that needs frequent deliveries or specialized products. But reliance on a single source means that the firm is at the mercy of the chosen supplier to deliver the needed goods or services without interruption. Multiple sourcing is buying a product from several suppliers. With multiple sourcing suppliers are more likely to remain price competitive. And if one supplier has problems with delivery, the firm has others to fall back on.
* Using one (or a few) suppliers rather than many has advanatges. A firm that buys from a single supplier becomes a large customer with a lot of clout when it comes to negotiating prices and contract terms. Having one (or a few) suppliers also lowers the firm's adminitrative costs because it has fewer invoices to pay, fewer purchase orders to put into the system, and fewer salespeople to see.
* Sometimes supplier selection is based on reciprocity, which means that a buyer and seller agree to be each other's customers by saying essentially, "I'll buy from you and you buy from me". For example, a firm that supplies parts to a company that manufactures trucks would agree to buy trucks from only that firm. Consumer and Corporate Affairs Canada frowns on reciprocal agreements and often determines that such agreements between large firms are illegal because they limit free competition--new suppliers simply don't have a chance against the preferred suppliers. In other countries, reciprocity is a common and often, expected practice in business-to-business marketing.
* With outsourcing, firms obtain outside vendors to provide goods or services that might otherwise be supplied in-house. For example, the fedaral government could have managed its own electronic tendering system but found it more cost effective and efficient to outsource this service to MERX. Outsourcing has undoubtedly become a growing trend in recent years as highly trained services providers in China, India, and other parts of the world are able to do increasingly sophiisticated work--including preparing Canadian corporate tax and personal tax returns.
* Another type of buyer-seller partnership is **reverse marketing**. Instead of sellers trying to identify potential customers and then "pitching" their products, **buyers try to find suppliers capable of producing specific products they need and then attempt to "sell" the idea to sujppliers. The seller works to satisfy the buying firm's needs while assuring themselves of product quality, sufficient supply, and reasonable terms.**

### Post-Purchase Evaluation
* Just as consumers evaluate purchases, an organizational buyer assesses whether the performance of the product and the supplier is living up to expectations. **The buyer surveys the users to determine their satisfaction with the product as well as with the installation, delivery and service provided by the supplier.** By reviewing supplier performance, a firm decides whether to keep or drop the supplier. Many suppliers recognize the importance of conducting their own performance reviews on a regular basis. Measuring up to a customer's expectations can mean winning or losing a big account.

## ELECTRONIC BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS COMMERCE
* The Internet has brought about the most important changes in organizational buying behaviour in recent years. Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the ubying and selling of products electronically via the Internet. We see e-commerce in consumer markets--sites such as Chapter.Indigo or Futureshop.ca that sell consumer goods (to be discussed in Chapter 11: Retailing and Etailing). In this chapter we are conerned with e-commerce in business markets. Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce refers to the Internet exchanges between two or more businesses or organizations. B2B e-commerce includes exchanges of information, products, services, and payments. It's not as glitzy as consumer e-commerce, but it has changed the way businesses operate.
* For several decades, firms have used electronic data interchange (EDI) system to communicate with business partners. Despite the growing popularity of technologies such as XML services, EDI is still the most used data format by e-commerce transactions around the world. EDI allows for limited communication through the exchange of computer data between two companies. But EDI is expensive and transmit only rigidly formatted electronic documents such as purchase orders and invoices.
* WorldBid.com is the largest source of international trade leads, requests for quotation, and tender opportunities fromm companies and government organizations around the world. Over 430,000 businesses have registered to help increase sales, reduce supplier costs, and find new business contacts.

## CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANGEMENT: A TOOL TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS
* IN the last section we discussed how business-to-business commerce and e-commerce are important parts of our economy. Experts advocate that, to retain customers, we should build a learning relationship with each of them. In other words, technology enables us to build meaningful relationships with our customers by understanding their needs accurately, satisfying those needs in a superior fashion to our competitors, and adjusting our offerings as customer needs change. Customer Relatinship Management (CRM) is a tool that enables a firm to do just that.
* The CRM trend has also been referred as **one-to-one (1:1) marketing and relationship marketing**. Don Peppers, a leading writer and consultant in this area, defines CRM as "...managing customer relationship. If I'm manageing customer relationships, it means I'm treating different customer differently, across all enterprises... The relationship develops a context over time, it drives achange in behaviour...this means that I have to change my behaviour as an enterprise based on a customer." A CRM strategy allows a company to identify its best customers, stay on top of their needs, and increase their satisfaction. In Chapter 4 (Marketing research) you learned a little bit about customer satisfaction research. Table below outlines how customer satisfaction information can be used in CRM strategies

                        Bulk of responses       Strategic Response
        Stage 1         2-3 (dissatisfied)      Deliver the basic product or service elements as expected of anyone in the industry
        Stage 2         3-4 (neutral)           Provide an appropriate range of supporting services; Develop proactive service recovery to make amends when something goes wrong
        Stage 3         4-5 (satisfied)         Understand and achieve results in customers' term

### CRM: A New Perspective on an Old Problem
* CRM is about communicating with customers and customers being able to communicate with a company one-to-one. CRM systems are applications that automate interactions between customer and companies, through computers, CRM computer software, databases, and often the Internet. They include everything from websites that let you check on the status of a bill or package to call centres that solicit your business. The Federal Express website use a CRM system to let customer track lost packages. When you get a phone message from the dentist reminding you about that filling appointment tomorrow, that's a CRM system. Car dealers use CRM when they call to ask how you like your new vehicle.
* To appreciate the value of a CRM strategy, consider the experience of financial services firms such as Sallomon Smith Barney and Fidelity Investment, both of which have adopted this new perspective. In general an investment banker needs to manage accounts as well as open new ones--often 30 to 50 per month. The process of opening the account can take 45 minutes, not a satisfying process for the banker or for the customer. But with an automated CRM system the banker can open an account, issue a welcome letter, and procue an arbitration agreement in 10 minutes. 
* She can create a unique marketing communication campaign for each client based on that person's life cycle--including such variables as when a person opened an account, their annual income, family situation, and desired retirement age. The marketer can generate a happy anniversary letter to clients (to commemorate when they joined the firm, not when they got married) and include an invitation to update their investment objectives.
* These firms have found that this level of individualized attention results in a much higher rate of customer satisfaction and retention, so CRM creates a win-win situation. This success helps to explain when CRM is hot: INdustry sources estimate, that, in 2007, companies, small and large, spent US$20 billion to purchase sophisticated software that will elt them build these electronic bridges.
* In addition to mollifying angry customers, marketers can use CRM systems to keep better track of enthusiastic ones. For example, marketers of youth products are intergrating CRM technology into their efforts in the following ways:

        * Sprite stage a "Rocket Cash" sweepstakes promotion by sending out legions of marketing representatives with handheld touch-screen devices. They hung out at concerts and on street corners and enticed young people to enter the sweepstakes by tapping their names, e-mail addresses, and birthdays into the devices on the spot. Every evening, data were uploaded to Sprite's website and entrants were kept informed by email of their status in the sweepstakes. Needless to say, in return Sprite wound up with a great list of consumers with whom it could continue to communciate in the future
        * Bacardi held a similar sweepstakes, but in this case the rum marketer also took digital photos of drivers' licences to verify consumers' ages
        * Ford sponsored a concert tour called Area One on behalf of its youth-oriented Focus model. At each of the tour's 17 stops, attendees could have their pictures taken next to a souped-up version of the Focus. If you wanted to see your photo, your registerd your email address with Ford and went to a special website where you could download your picture in a special frame (branded with Focus information) and email the picture to your friends. Successful? Ford reported that 87 percent of the people who had their picture taken went to the website to retrieve them. And Ford was able to use the email address to build relationship with these prospective customers.

* Perhaps the most important aspect of CRM is that it presents a new way of looking at how to commpete effectively in the marketplace. This begins with looking at customers as partners. CRM proponents suggest that the traditional relationship between customers and marketers is an adversarial one, where marketers try to sell their products and customers seek ways to avoid buying. The customer relationship perspective sees customers as partners, with each partner learning from the other every time they interact. Success firms compete by establishing relationships with individual customers on a one-to-one basis through dialogue and feedback. Business-to-business relationships can be maintained by calling to check on orders and assess future needs. What does this customer really want?
* And, of course, when we say customers we don't just mean end consuemrs--CRM is widely used to strengthen business-to-business relationships as well. To understand the importance of this kind of thinking, consider the experience of Dow, a giant corporation that sells US$60 billion worth of chemicals, plastics, and agricultural products each year in more than 170 countries. Alhough Dow uses cutting-edge manufacturing technology every day, it had literally no centralized mechanism to keep track of its many customers.
* Eventually, Dow launched a major effort to install a company-wide CRM system that would be a central repository for customer information and would allow its customers to interact with Dow more efficiently--letting them access information automatically without having to deal with a large corporate bureacracy. The result? A web-based interace called MyAccount@Dow that lets customers log on (with a secure password, of course), enter new orders, check on the status of old orders, pay invoices electronically, and collaborate with others throughout the system. As a result, Dow lowered its customer support costs by US$15 million and is taking electronic orders of US$100 million per month.

## Characteristics of CRM
* In addition to having a different mindset, companies that successfully practice CRM have different goals, such different measures of success, and look at customers in some different ways. So CRM marketers look at their share of the customer, at the lifetime value of a customer, at customer equity, and at focusing on high-value customers.
* **SHARE OF CUSTOMER** Historically, marketers have measured success in a product category by their share of market. For example, if there are 100 million pairs of athletic shoes sold each year, a firm that sells 10 million of them has a 10 percent market share. If the shoemaker's marketing objective is to increase market share, it may lower the price of its shoes, increase its advertising, or offer customers a free basketball with every pair of shoes purchased. Such tactics may increase sales in the short run but, unfortunately, they may not do much for the long-term success of the shoemaker. In fact, such tactics many actually decrease the value of the brand by cheapening its image with giveaways.
* Because it is always easier and less expensive to keep an existing customer than to get a new customer, CRM firms focus on increasing their share of customer, not share of market. Let's say that a consuemr buy six pairs of shoes a year--two pairs from each of three different manufacturers. **Let's assume one shoemaker has a CRM system that allows it to send letters to its current customers inviting them to receive a special price discount or gift if they buy more of the firm's shoes during the year. Or, the CRM system could alert the consumer when the firm receives the consumer's favorite styles in stock.** If t he firm can get the consuemr to buy three or four or perhaps all six pairs from it, it has increased its share of customer. And that may not be too difficult because the customer already buys and supposedly like the firm's shoes.
* Without the CRM, the shoe company would probably use tradtional advertising to increase sales, which would be far more costly than the customer-only direct-mail compaign. So, the company can increase sales and profits at a much lower cost than it would spend to get one, two, or three new customers.
* **LIFETIME VALUE OF THE CUSOMTER** SKIM
* **CUSTOMER EQUITY**
* **A GREATER FOCUS ON HIGH-VALUE CUSTOMERS**


# CHAPTER 7: Product Strategy

## BUILD A BETTER MOUSETRAP
* "Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door". Although we've all heard that adage, the truth is: Just because a product is better, there is no guarantee it will succeed. For decades, the Woodstream Company built wood mousetraps. Then the company decide to build a better one. Woodstream's product development people researched mouse eating, crawling, and resting habits; built prototypes of different mousetraps to come up with the best possible design; and tested them in homes. Finally, the company unveiled the sleek-looking "Little Champ", ablack plastic miniature inverted bathtub with a hole. When the mouse went in and ate the bait, a spring snapped upward, and the mouse was history. Sounds like a great new product, but the "Little Champ" failed. **Woodstream studied mouse habits, not consumer preference**. The company later discovered that husbands set the trap at night, but wives were left to dispose of the trap holding the dea mouse in the morning. Unfortunately, wives though the "Little Champ" looked too expensive to throw away, so they felt they should empty the trap for reuse. This was a task most women weren't willing to do--they wanted a trap they could happily throw away.
* Another example of product development failures for marketers is Coca-Cola. In an attempt to revitalize its brand in th 80s. Coca-Cola introduced the New Coke. It has become a classic case in marketing. The introduction of the new product almost destroyed the company. Reputable firms like McDonald's, Levi's and Fruit of the Loom all failed at one point. What's behind these marketing failures? What can we learn from them? It just demonstrates that new product failture is rarely a black-and-white issue and that the final result often takes a long time to manifest itself. Woodstream and Coke's failtures underscore the importance of creating products that provide benefits people seek.

## CREATING AND NURTURING PRODUCTS
* What makes one product fail and another enjoy great success? What is the difference between a product and a brand? Do all products enjoy brand status? It's worth repeating what we said in Chapter 2: Firms that plan well succeed. Product planning plays a big role in the firm's marketing plans. The strategies outlined in the product plan tell how the firm expects to develop a product that will meet marketing objectives. The next two chapters are intrinsically related. We will introduce the product decision process below. In Chapter 7, we will discuss **what a product really is** and **how new products are developed and introduced into the marketplace**. This will include **developing product objectives** and the **strategies required to successfully market products as they evolve over time**. In Chapter 8, we'll finish the product part of the story by discussing **how companies manage products** and **examine the steps in product planning**. We'll also discuss **branding, one of the most important decisions product planners make**, and **examine how firms organize for effective product and brand management.**

        Product Decisions -> Objective and Policy
                          -> Product Concept
                          -> Product Strategy
                          -> Service Strategy
                          -> Branding Strategy

## PRODUCT OBJECTIVES
* When marketers develop product strategies, **they are making decisions about product benefits, features, styling, branding, labelling, logos, and packaging.** But what do they want to accomplish? Clearly stated product objectives product focus and direction. Product objectives should **support the broader marketing objectives of the business unite in addition to supporting the overall mission of the firm.** For example, if the objective of the firm focus on a certain return on investment, its marketing objectives may then focus on market share and/or unit or dollar sales volume neccessary for the firm to attain that return on investment. Product objectives need to specify how product decisions will support or contribute to reaching a desired market share or level of sales. (You will find more on the relationship between marketing objectives and marketing strategies in Chapter 14 on developing and implementing marketing plans.)
* To be effective, product-related objectives must be measurable, clear and unambiguous, and feasible ,and must specify a time frame. Consider, for example, how a frozen-entree manufacturer might state its product objectives:

        [IMPORTANT]
        * "In the upcoming fiscal year, modify the product's fat content to reflect the trend toward low-fat foods."
        * "Introduce three new items to the product line to take advanatge of increased consumer interest in ethnic foods"
        * "During the coming fiscal year, improve the chicken entrees to the extent that consumers will rate them as better tasting than the competition's"

* The frozen manufacturer might use a matrix, like the one shown below, to guide product objectives

                                 Current Markets                   New Markets
        Current Product           Market Penetration                Market Development

        New Product               Product Development               Diversification

        Market Penetration: the frozen entree manufacturer may entice consumers to buy more of its products
        Market development: The frozen entree manufacturer may expand internationally
        Product Development: The frozen entree manufacturer may develop a new line of fat-free products aimed at current consumers
        Diversification: The frozen entree manufacturer may introduce a new line of products aimed at a new market: the ethnic consumer

* As shown above, **the firm can follow one of four strategies**, depending on whether the products or markets are current or new. A good way for a firm to use the grid is to ensure it has a good balance between the four quadrants. **A focus on only one or two quadrants suggests that the firm may be vulnerable to marketplace forces.**
* Planners must keep in touch with consumers or business customers so that their objectives accurately respond to customer needs. Equally important in developing product objectives is an up-to-date knowledge of competitive product innovations. Above all, product objectives should consider the long-term implications of product decisions. Planners who sacrifice the long term health of the organization to reach short term sales or financial goals are being irresponsible. Product planners may focus on one or more individual products at a time, or they may look at a group of product offerings as a whole. In this section, we examine these different strategies.

## THE PRODUCT CONCEPT
* As defined in Chapter 1, a product is anyhting tangible or intangible that, through the exchange process, satisfied consumer or business customer needs. **Products can be physical goods, services, ideas, people, or places.** A good may be a sweatshirt, pack of cookies, digital camera, house, tractor, or pair of jeans. A good is a tangible product, something that we can see, touch, smell, hear, taste, or possess. In contrast, intangible product--services, ideas, people, places--are products that we can't always see, touch, taste, smell, or possess. **Banking services, a concert, convincing people to recycle or vote for a particular political candidate, and getting people to visit a particular province on their next vacation are all examples of intangible products.**
* Marketers think of the product as more than just a thing that comes in package. **They view a product as a bundle of attributes, including packaging, brand name, benefits, and supporting features, in addition to a physical good. In this chapter, we'll first examine what a product is, and how thinking about the different layers of a product helps a marketer build an edge in the marketplace.** Then we'll look at the difference between goods and services and the implications this has for marketing strategy. Finally, we will examine new products--how marketers develop new products and how markets accept them.

### Layers of the Product Concept
* **A product is everything that a customer receives in an exchange.** As figure shows below, the products has three distinct layers--the core, actual, and augmented product. These layers are very useful because they teach us how to build a competitive edge in the marketplace. Let us see how. 
* The **core product** refers to product features or attributes: *Dove soap has moisturizing cream.* The **actual product** refers to how the product actually looks and performs: *How easy it is to use Dove, how foamy it is, etc.* The **augmented product** refers to the augmentation (that is, the additions) the marketers attaches to the basic product: Dove's packaging, logo, brand name, customer satisfaction guarantees, etc.
* How does the knowledge of product layers build a competitive advnatage? The answer is simple--consumers do not buy product features, they buy the benefits offered by the product. So, Dove should not focus on the fact that its soap contains moisturizing cream; instead, it should focus its marketing communication efforts on the benefits the brand provides to consumers. it is this potential product that consumers can relate to and that can build a relationship with the brand. Also, the potential product is difficult for competitors to successfully imitate because Dove has claimed it first.

### Product Line Decisions
* After deciding on concepts for their products, marketers need to decide how many different types of products and how many variants of each type they are going to offer.
* **STRATEGIES FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS** The Volkswagen Beetle is an interesting story of a product that triumphed over great obstacles. When the product was first introduced in North America in the 1960s, dealers complained that the car was too ugly to sell. Many of those dealers were soon kicking themselves; dealers who did accept the challenge sold over 21 million Beetles to true believers who adored the car's simple engineering and funky image. The Beetle was a tremendously successful product in the 1960s and 1970s, dispite its poor image. In the late 1990s, Volkswagen decided to capitalize on baby boomers' warm memories of the Beetle by introducing a "concept car" model reminiscent of the original.
* Some product strategies, including those used in introducing the new VW Beetle, **focus on a single new product. However, strategies for individual product may be quite different for new products, for regional products, and for mature products.**
* **For new products, the objectives relate to successful introduction.** Warner-Lambert Canada worked hard to introduce Dentyne Ice gum to youth across Canada. After a firm has experienced considerable success with a product in a local or regional market. However, it may consider it time to grow the business by introducing the product nationally. Big Rock Brewery, a Calgary microbrewery, used its success in the Alberta beer market to introduce its beer into Ontario and British Columbia.
* **For mature product, prodcut objectives may focus on breathing new life into a product long taken for granted while holding onto the traditional brand personality.** In the case of Cracker Jack, for instance, this means keeping consumer perceptions of the product positive. The images of Sailor jack and his dog Bingo have been updated at least four times since the original design of 1893.
* **STRATEGIES FOR MULTIPLE PRODUCTS** Although a small firm might focus on one product, a larger company usually market a mix of related products. This means that some strategic decisions affect two or more products at once. Thus, the firm must think in terms of its entire portfolio of products. Product planning means developing product line and product mix strategies that encompass multiple offerings. 
* **Product Line Strategies** A product line is a firm's total product offering designed to satisfy a single need or desire of a group of target customers. For example, Procter&Gamble's line of fabric and home-care prodcuts includes four different types of laundry soap: Tide, Cheer, Gain, and Ivory Snow. To do an even better job of meeting varying consumer needs, each of the brands, commes in several different formulations. For example, in addition to regular Tide, there is Tide with bleach and Ultra Tide. The number of separate items offered within the same category determines the length of the product line.
* When a firm has a large number of variations in its product line, it is said to carry a full line. With a full-line strategy, it is possible to please many customer segments, thus increasing total sales potential. A company that adopts a limited-line strategy markets a smaller number of product variation. **Sometimes, having a limited product line can improve the image of a firm, because it is perceived to be a specialist and have a clear, specific position in the market. Rolls-Royce, for example, makes only expensive, custom-built automobiles and, for years, has maintained a unique position in the automobile industry.**
* In developing product strategies, organizations may decide to extend their product lines by adding more brands or models. Bombardier Inc., the manufacturer of Sea-Doos and Ski-Doos, extended its recreactional prodcut line with the introduction of its Traxter ATV.
* When a company stretches its product line, it must decide on the best direction in which to go. If a firm's current product line includes middle- and lower-end items, an upward line stretch would add new items--those with a higher price, better quality, or mroe features. Folgers and Maxwell House took this route by adding such new coffee varieties as Gourmet Supreme, Columbian Supreme, Frech Roast, and Italian Espresso Roast.
* Conversely, a downward line stretch completes a line by adding items at the lower end. **Here the firm must be careful that the lwoer-end items don't blur the images of higher-priced, upper-end offerings.** A firm like Godiva may not want to run the risk of cheapening its image, for example, by creating a new, less expensive chocolate bar to compete with products like Mr. Big and Sweet Marie.
* In some cases, a firm may decide that its existing product line is meeting the needs of only a small portion of the market and that there is more than one opportunity for growth. Then the product strategy may call for *a two-way stretch*, that is, adding items at both the upper and lower ends. Marriott Hotels, for example, has added Fairfield Inns and Courtyard at the lower end and Marriot Marquis Hotels and the Ritz Carlton at the upper end.
* A *filling-out strategy* may mean adding sizes or styles not previously available in a product category. Quebec's Lassonde did this when it was the first juice company in North America to use aseptic plastic bottles for its Fruite drinks. It also introduced the first refrigerated vegetable juice in North America, Vegetable Delight. Sometimes the best strategy may be to contract a product line, particularly when somme of the items are not profitable. For example, when sales for the once-popular Oldsmobile brand slowed, GM dropped the brand from its line.
* As we have seen, there are many ways a firm can modify its product line to meet the competeition or take advantage of new opportunities in the marketplace. To further explore these strategic decisions, we return tok Procter & Gamble. What does P&G do if the objective is to increase market share in the fabric-care market? One possibility would be to expand its line of laundry detergents. If the line extension meets a perceived consumer need not being addressed currently, this would be a good strategic move. But whenever a product line or a product family is extended, there is the danger of cannibalization, which occurs when sales of an existing brand are eaten up by the new item, as the firm's current customer switch to the new product. This explains why P&G has created a whole new product line with its Dryel product to achieve growth in fabric care. The Dryel product is not cannibalizing sales from detergents such as Tide and Ivory Snow.
* **Product Mix Strategies** Product planning can go beyond a single product item or a product line to entire groups of products. A firm's product mix is its entire range of products. For example, in addition to a deep line of shaving products, Gillette makes toiletries such as Dry Idea and Right Guard deodorant, Paper mate and Flair writing instruments, Oral B toothbrushes, Braun small appliances, and Duracell batteries.
* In developing a product mix strategy, planners usually consider the width of the product mix, the number of product lines produced by the firm. By developing several different product lines, firms can reduce the risk associated with "putting all their eggs in one basket". Normally, firms develop a mix of product lines that have some similarities, for example, products that can share distribution channels or manufacturing facilities. Someimtes, firms expand into new product lines to take advantage of a strong brand reputation with an existing target market. 
* **Service Strategy** Whether it is customer support, training, delivery, gift wrapping, helpful advice, or a customized experience, "service" is associated with most products and some products, like getting a haircut, are mostly about the service offered. Marketing decision makers need to decide what type of service they are going to provide, at what level of quality. In the section that follows we are going to examine key differences between goods and services and discuss the marketing implications of these differences. In more advanced marketing courses you will learn that service strategy decisions also involve service recovery systems and approach for measuring service quality.

### The Good-Services Continuum
* In reality, most products are a combination of goods and services. The purchase of a "pure service" like a makeover at a department store has product components, for example, lotions, powders, and lipsticks the cosmetologist uses to create the "new you"
* The good-services continuum shows that some products are dominated by either tangible or intangible characteristics--for instance, salt versus teaching--whereas others tend to include a mixture of goods and services--such as flying in an airplane. A product's placement on t his continuum gives some guidance as to which marketing issues are likely to be most relevant. As the product appraoches the tangible pole of this continuum, there is fairly little emphasis on service; the physical product itself is the focal point, and people will choose one over others based on the product's function or image. To compete, the marketer will try to differentiate based on services. So car manufacturers may try to differentiate goods by providing a unique service dimension (e.g., the dealership experience)
* As the product gets near the intangible pole, the physical product shrinks in importance, and the service encounter plays a key role in shaping the service experience. Marketers of these products try to make their offerings more tangible. Scarborough General hospital, for example, provides all patients with a chart explaining precisely when and exactly what is going to happen to them during their stay in the hospital. This minimizes patient frustration by shaping their expectations 
* In the middle of the continuum, however, both goods and services contribute substantially to the quality of the product ,because these products rely on people to satisfactorily operate equipment that will deliver quality service. Let's consider each of these three positions as we move from prodcuts dominated by tangibles to those dominated by intangibles.
* **GOOD-DOMINATED PRODUCTS** Many tangible products are accompanied by supporting services, even if this means only that the company maintains a toll-free telephone line or website for questions or provides a 30-day warranty against defects. Including a service with the purchase of a physical good is termed **embodying**. This is a popular option in teh computer industry, especially for companies that are trying to break into international markets saturated with cheap products but with insufficient guidance in their use. As millions of people buy computers and other hardware, they are apt to find it difficult to navigate the maze of set-up instructions, and next to impossible to cope with machines that unexpectedly crash. Indeed, one survey by PC Magazine found that 28 percent of its readers needed technical support in the first year of owning a personal computer. What's more, in grading manufacturers' service performance, they gave two-thirds of them Cs and Ds. Commpanies with the resources to do so find that embodying follow-up service is a potent marketing tool when competing with "clone" manufacturers. As an executive at Compaq (now owned by HP) observed, "The bad guys give up an opportunity to differentiate".
* **EQUIPMENT- OR FACILITY-DRIVEN SERVICES** Some products require a mixture of tangible and intangible elements. **Many hospitals and restaurants fall in the middle of the continuum because they rely on expensive equipment or facilities and skilled personnel to deliver a product.**
* *Facility-driven services*, such as automatic car washes, amusement parks, meseum, movie theatres, health clubs, and zoos, must be concerned with these three important factors

1. Operational factors: **Technologies must move customers smoothly through the service. Clear signs and other guidelines must show customers how t o use the service. In particular, firms need to minimize waiting times.** Marketers have developed a number of tricks to give impatient customers the illusion that they aren't waiting too long. **One hotel chain, responding to complaints about the long wait for elevators, installed mirros in the lobby: people tendency to examine their appearance occupied them until the elevators arrived, and protests declined.** **Burger King's research showed that multiple lines create stress in customers--especially if one moves faster than the others--so it shifted to single lines in which customers at the head of the line order at the next available register.**
2. Location factors: These are especially important for frequently purchased services, such as dry cleaning, that are obtained at a fixed location. Fast food restaurant, such as Subway, try to have several restaurants, all in convenient locations, to satisfy customers need for convenience.
3. Environmental factors: Service managers who operate a storefront service requiring people to come to their location realize they must create an attractive environment to lure customers. That's why sports venues such as the Saddledome in Calgary offer plush luxury suites, where wealthy patrons can watch sports events in style. The Calgary Flames, like many Canadian sports franchises, tries to provide all fans with a fun, exciting environment when they attend their games by including such features as between-period contests, promotions, and other fun events.

* One trend is for services to adopt a more retail-like philosophy, borrowing techniques fromm clothing stores or restaurants to create a pleasant environment. Banks, for example, are creating signature looks for branches through the use of lighting, color, and art. When ING Direct, a Netherlands-based bank, opened in Canada, it didn't open any traditional bank branches. The company, which specializes in web- and telephone-based banking transactions, decided to open cafes instead of branches, where banking services were sold along with Starbucks and other brands of coffee.

* **PEOPLE-BASED SERVICES** At the intangible end of the continuum are people-based services. In the Great American Backrub store, for instance, customers sit in a specially designed chair and, for $7.95, get a massage that lasts exactly eight minutes (no appointment necessary). The owner of the store explained, "To get Americans to buy massages, I realize you had to solve three problems. You had to come up with something that was quick, inexpensive, and most important, you had to find a way to do it without asking people to take their clothing off".
* Because people have less and less time to perform various task, the importance of people-based services is increasing. Personal concierge services, such as Toronto-based Orderly Lives, is a growing industry, because tehy help consumers meet obligation despite time pressure by doing almost anything for them, from organizing a party to doing the grocery shopping to planning a vacation. Self-improvement services such as those offered by personal shoppers, wardrobe consultant, and personal trainers are also popular and, in some cities, even professional dog-walkers do a brisk business

### What Are the Key Differences Between Services and Goods?
* **Services** are acts, effots, or performances **exhcnaged from producer to user without ownership rights**. Like other intangibles, a service satisfies needs by ***providing pleasure, information, or convenience***. About 75 percent of the Canadian population is employed in the service sector in such industries as **banking, insurance, professional services, hosiptality, transportation, education, health care, hotels, restaurants, and recreational services.**
* Services come in many forms, from those done to you, such as a massage or a teeth cleaning, to those done for you, such as having your CD player repaired, getting a new paint job on your car, or having an organization like Charity.ca ensure that your money gets to the charity of your choice. Regardless of whether they affect our bodies or your possession, all services share four characteristics that make them distinct from goods: **intangibility, perishability, variability, and inseparability**.
* **INTANGIBILITY** Service intangibility means that customers can't see, touch, or smell good service. Unlike the purchase of a good, they can not inspect or handle services before they purchase them. Because they're buying something that isn't there, consumers look for reassuring signs before purchasing, and marketers must ensure that these signs are available of the facility can make or break a service busienss. When we talk about how customers decide if a service is giving them what they want, marketers overcome the problem of intangibility by providing physicaly cues to reassure the buyer. **These cues include uniforms, brand logos, and carefully designed websites.**
* **PERISHABILITY** Service perishability means a firm can't store its services--it's a case of use it or lose it. When rooms go unoccupied at a ski resort, there is no way to make up for the lost opportunity to exchange a product for money. Marketers try to avoid these problems by using the marketing mix to encourage demand for the service during times when it would otherwise be low. Capacity management is the process by which organizations adjust their services in an attempt to match demand. in the summer, for example, Whistler combats its perishability problem by opening its lift to mountain bikers, who tear down the sunny slopes.
* **VARIABILITY** Service variability is the inevitable differences in a service provider's performances from one day to the next: An NHL goalie may be "hot" one game and ice cold the next. Even the same service performed by the same individual for the same customer can vary. It's rare that you get exactly the same cut from a hair stylist.
* It is diffcult to standardize services, because service providers and customers vary. Your experience in courses is an example. A university or college can standardize its offerings to some degree--course calendars, course content, and classrooms are fairly controllable. Professors, however, vary in their training, life experiences, and personalities, so there is little hope of being able to make teaching uniform. And because students with different backgrounds and interests vary in their needs, the lecture that one finds fascinating might put another to sleep.
* Firms handle this aspect of services by standardizing their processes as much as possible. McDonald's, for example, has a hamburger University outside Chicago where managers and franchisees are taught different aspects of teh restaurant process, including the correct arm motion to use when salting french fries
* **INSEPARABILITY** Although a firm can manufacture goods before sale, a service can take place only at the time the service provider performs an act on either the customer or the customer's possession. In some cases, the service can be sold before delivery, such as a ticket to a concert months before the event.
* Still, the expertise, skill, and personality of a provider, or the quality of a firm's facilities and equipment, can not be detached from the offering itself. The central role played by employees in making or breaking a service underscores the importance of the service encounter, or t he interaction between the customer and the service provider. The most expertly cooked meal is ruined if a surly or incompetent waiter brings it to the table. Our interactions with service providers can range from the most superficial, such as buying a movie ticket, to telling a psychiatrist (or bartender) our most intimate secrets. In each case, though, the quality of the service necounter can play a big role in determining how we feel about the service we receive.
* To minimize the potentially negative effects of bad service encounters and to save on labour costs, some service businesses are experimenting with disintermediation, which eliminates the need for customers to interact with people. Examples are self-service gas stations, Internet banking, and ABM machines. Even salad and dessert bars reduce reliance on a server. A recent Economist article suggested that pilots eventually will be made redundant as advances in aviation technology become incorporated into new products.

## DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS
* Building on our knowledge of the nature of a product, we'll now examine how firms go about developing new products. Product development doesn't simply mean creating totally new products never before on the market. Many companies do that; **but for many other firms, product development is a continuous process of looking for ways to make an existing product better or finding just the right shade of green for this year's bath fashions.**
* The successful introduction of new prodcuts is getting tougher for entrepreneurs to accomplish. Even for large corporations, successful new product introductions are becoming more and more diffciult. First, the cost of research and development are often so huge t hat firms must limit the number of new products in development. The fast pace of technological change means that products are outdated faster than ever, giving firms less time to reocver their research and development costs. And, with so many products competing for limited shelf space, retailers often charge manufacturers exorbitant fees to stock a new product, increasing manufacturers' costs even more. Firms must reduce the time it takes to get good products to market and increase the speed of adoption to quickly recover these costs.
* New product development occurs in three phases, as shown below. **In the visionary phase, a firm generates and scrfeens ideas to identify those that will work best for it. The planning and development phase means turning those ideas into a product. The test and improve phase means trying out marketing strategies in test markets to improve the marketing plans and product, if needed, before full commercial launch.**

        Phase of Development                    Outcome

        *Visionary*
        * Idea generation                       Identify product ideas that will provide important customer benefits compatible with company mission
        * Product concept screening             Esitmate potential technical and commercial success of product ideas
        * Perform business analysis             Estimate potential for profit. What is the potential demand, what expenditure will be required, and what is the cost of marketing the product.

        *Planning and Development*
        * Begin commercial development          Develop a marketing plan
        * Begin technical development           Design the product and the manufacturing and production process

        *Test and Improve*
        * Test complete marketing plan          Develop evidence of potential success in the real market
        * Marketing mix adjustments             Make improvements in marketing mix as needed
        * Launch product                        Implement full-scale marketing plan

### The Visionary Phase
* In the visionary phase of product development, marketers generate new product ideas, screen new product concepts, and complete a business analysis. Marketers use a variety of sources to come up with great new product ideas that provide important customer benefits and are commpatible with the company's mission. **Ideas can come from employees, customers, as well as salespeople, service providers, and others who have direct customer contact.** Often firms use such marketing research activities as focus groups for new product idea generation. For example, a company like CanWest Global Communications that operates TV stations might hold focus group discussions t o get ideas about types of programs not currently available.
* Although ideas for product initially comme from a variety of sources, it is up to marketers to expand these ideas into more complete product concepts. Product concepts describe what features the product should have and the benefits those features will provide for consumers. the second step in developing new products is screening product concepts. **In screening, marketers and researchers examine the chances that the product concept might achieve success.** Estimating technical success is assessing whether the new product is technologically feasible--is it possible to build this product? Estimating commercial success is deciding whether anyone is likely to buy the product? The marketing graveyard is littered with products that sounded interesting but that failed to catch on, including jalapeno pop, aerosol mustard, microwavable ice crean, aerosol toothpaste, and edible deodorant.
* The marketers of Fit had to first determine that producing a fruit and vegetable wash product would be possible--technical success. Researchers then had to interview consumers to see if they thought a fruit and vegetable cleaning product was something they would purchase.
* Once a product concept passes the screening stage, marketers conduct a busienss analysis. Even if they have evidence that there is a market for the product **they still must find out if the product can be profitable contribution to the organization's product mix.How much potential demand is there for the product? Does the firm have the resources that will be required for successful development and introduction of the product?**
* The business analysis for a new product begins with assessing how the new product will fit into the firm's total product mix. Will the new product increase sales, or will it cannibalize sales of existing products? Are there possible synergies between the new product and the company's existing offerings that may improve visibility and the image of both? What is the probable customer demand for the new product. An equally important part of the business analysis is estimating the marketing costs necessary to stimulate demand and achieve desired distribution levels. This estimation may include the costs of training a sales force, recruiting distributors, advertising, conducting sales promotions, and communicating through press releases and direct mail.

### Planning and Development
* If it survives the scrutiny of a business analysis, a new product concept then undergoes commercial and technical development. **Commercial development means putting together a marketing plan that builds on the initial projections made during product screening and business analysis. Forecasts are adjusted to fit more precise information about the market and how customers will respond to the product. Marketers also plan pricing, advertising, and distribution strategies. Prospective customers are again involved in the planning and development process--the better a firm understands how customers will react to a new product, the better its chances of commercial success.**
* In technical development, a firm's engineers work with marketers to refine the design and production process. Those involved in the technical development process must, for example, determine which parts of a finished good the company will make and which one will be bought from other suppliers. If goods are to be manufactured, the company may have to buy new production equipment or modify existing machinery. Someone has to develop work instructions for employees and train them to produce the product. In developing service processes, technical development includes such decisions as which activities will occur within sight of customers and whether parts of t he service can be automated to make delivery mroe efficient.
* **Technical development sometimes requires applying for a patent.** Because patents legally prevent competitors from producing or selling the invention, a patent can reduce or eliminate competition in a market for many years, allowing a firm "breathing room" to recoup investments in technical devbelopment. For example, for many years, G.D Searle Pharmaceuticals (makers of Metamucil and Celebrex, now owned by Monsanto) held the patent for its nutraSweet brand of artificial sweetener. This exclusive right to make and sell the product allowed the company to reap huge profits, because no other company had a similar product. now that the patent has expired, there will be competition in this market.

### Testing and Improving the Product
* The final phase of new product development includes test marketing, making final adjustments to the marketing mix, and commercial launch. In test marketing, the firm tries out the complete marketing plan--the distribution, advertising, sales promotion--but in a small geographic area that is similar to the larger market it hopes to enter. Test marketing can be conducted in an area as small as one city or as large as a country. For example, Vancouver has become a popular test market for innovative products, because Vancouverites have a reputation for being interested in new and unconventional things.
* Kera Vision, a U.S. optical company, chose Vancouver as a test market for Intacs, a product that attaches to the eye to reshape the cornea and improve vision. LG Electronics, a korean appliance manufacturer, used all of Canada as a test market for the North American launch of its "smart" appliances, including an Internet fridge, which allows users to surf the web, send email, or watch TV on a monitor built into the fridge, and a washing machine t hat automatically measures the detergent, determines water level, and sets the speed.
* There are pluses and minuses to test marketing. On t he negative side, test marketing is extremely expensive. It can cost over a million dollars to conduct a test market even in a single city. **A test market also gives the competition a free look at the new product, its introductory price, and the intended marketing communication strategy--and an opportunity to foil the test market by increasing their own promotion or get to the market first with a competitive product.**
* Because the problems with test marketing, marketers sometimes conduct simulated test markets. Simulated test marrket imitate the introduction of a product into the marketplace using computer software. These simulations allow the company to test the impact of price cuts, new packaging, or even where on store shelves to feature the product. The process entails gathering basic research data on consumer perceptions of the product concept, the physical product, the advertising, and other promotional activity. The test market simulation model uses that information to predict the product's success much less expensively (and more discreetly) than traditional test market. As this simulated test market technology improves, tradtional test markets may become a thing of the past.
* On the positive side, by offering new product in a limited area of the market, marketers can evaluate and improve the marketing program. Sometimes, test marketing uncovers a need to improve the product itself; sometimes, it indicates product failure, allowing the firm to save millions of dollars by "pulling the plug"
* The last step in new product development is the product launch. Launching a new product requires full-scale production, distribution, advertising, sales promotion--the works. For this reason, full-scale introduction of a new product can not happen overnight. A launch requires planning and careful preparation. Marketers must implement trade promotion plans, which offer special incnetives to encourage dealers, retailers, or other members of the channel to stock the new product so that customers will find it on store shelves the very first time they look. They must also develop consumer promotions, such as coupons. Marketers may arrange to have point-of-purchase displays designed, built, and delivered to retail outlets. If the new product is especially complex, customer service employees must recieve extensive training and preparation.
* As launch time nears, preparations gain a sense of urgency. Sales managers explain special incentive programs to salespeople. Soon, the media announce to prospective customers why they should buy and where they can find the new product. All elements of the marketing program--ideally--come into play like a well-tuned orchestra.

## CLASSIFYING PRODUCTS
* Classifying a product can be challenging. A product can be a tangible good or an intangible service or idea, and different layers of a product exist. Marketers classify products into different categories since they want to cater to different customers and products are perceived differently by customers as well. Classifying products assists marketers in understsanding what marketing mix should apply for certain products and certain markets.
* Usually, product are consumer-oriented products, or simply designed to develop the business-to-business market, although businesses and consumers may be attracted to the same product, such as  toilet paper, vacuum cleaners, and light bulbs. In these cases, though, busiensses tend to buy a lot more of them at once. Of course, as we saw in earlier chapters, customers differ in how they decide on a purchase, depending on wether the decision maker is a consumer or a business purchaser. Let's first consider differences in consumer products based on how long the product will last and on how the consumer shops for the products based on how long the product will last and on how the consumer shops for the products. Then we will discuss the general types of business-to-business products.

### Classifying Goods: How Long Does the Product Last?
* Marketers classify consumer goods as durable or nondurable depending on how long the product lasts. You expect refrigerators to last many years, but a litre of milk will last only a week until it turns into a science project. **Durable goods** are consumer products that provide benefits over a period of months, years, or even decades, such as cars, furniture, and appliances. In contrast, we consume **nondurable goods**, such as newspapers and food, in the short term.
* **We are more likely to purchase durable goods under conditions of high involvement, while nondurable goods are more likely to be low-involvement**. When consumers buy a computer or a house, they will spend a lot of time and energy on the decision process. When they offer these products, **marketers need to understand consumers' desires for different product benefits and the importance of warranties, service, and customer support.** So they must be sure that consumers can find the information they need to make a sound decision. Blog and a section called "Frequently asked questions" on the company's website can serve that purpose. When a company itself sponsors such forums, odds are the content will be much more favourable and the firm can police peripheral postings.
* In contrast, consumers usually don't look for details so much when choosing among nondurable goods. There is little if any search for information or deliberation. **Sometimes this means that consumers buy whatever brand is available and reasonably priced.** In other instances, they base their decisions largely on past experience, or even habit. For example, some consumers buy that familiar orange box of Tide laundry detergent again and again. In such cases, **marketers can probably be less concerned with developing new product features to attract customers; they should focus more on pricing and distribution strategies**

### Classifying Goods: How Do Consumers Buy the Product?
* Marketers classify products based on where and how consuemrs buy the product. We can think of both goods and services as **convenience products, specialty products, or unsought products**. In earlier chapters, we talked about how consuemr decisions differ in terms of effort, from habitual decision making to limited problem solving to extended problem solving. We can tie these differences in consumer decision making to the classification of products in terms of how consumers buy them. By understanding how consumers buy products, marketers have a clearer vision of the buying process that will help them develop effective marketing strategies based on the category into which their product falls.
* **CONVENIENCE PRODUCTS** A convenience product typically is a nondurable good or service that consumers purchase frequently with a minimum of comparison and effort. As the name implies, consumers expect these products to be handy and **will buy whatever brands are easy to obtain**. In general, convenience products are **low-priced and widely available**. You can buy butter or a loaf of bread at grocery stores, at convenience stores, and even at many service stations. Consumers know all they will need or want to know about a convenience product, devote little effort to purchases, and willingly accept alternative brands if their preferred brand is not available in a convenient location. Most convenient product purchases are the result of habitual consumer decision making. Accessibility and availability are essential for this type of product. Marketers classify convenience products as staples, impulse products, and emergency products.
* **Staple** such as eggs, toothbrushes, and bottled water are basic or necessary items that are available almost everywhere. Most consumers don't perceive big differences among brands. When selling staples, **marketers must offer customers a product that consistently meet their expectations for quality and make sure it is available at a price comparable to the competition's prices.**
* Consider this situation: You are standing in the checkout line at the supermarket and notice a copy of Canadian Business magazine featuring a photo of Mike Weir, a famous Canadian professional golfer. If you enjoy golfing, you will check out that article! This magazine is an **impulse product**, something people often buy on the spur of the moment. **With an impulse product, marketers have two challenges: to creat a product or package design that is enticing, that "reaches out and grabs the customers", and to make sure their product is highly visible, for example, by securing prime end-aisle or checkout-lane space**
* **Emergency product** are products we purchae when we're in dire need. Bandages, umbrellas, and something to unclog the bathroom sink are examples of emergency products. Because we need the product badly and immediately, price and seomtimes product quality may be irrelevant to our decision to purchase. If you're caught out in a sudden downpour, any umbrella at any price may do. **To be successful, an emergency product should be reliable, and should be offered in the sizes customers want.**
* **Fast-moving consuemr goods** are any product that exhibit consistently high velocity of sales in teh consuemr marketplace, and represent an important part of our economy. Soap, diapers, and shampoo are considered FMCGs. Major consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Unilever, each of which has an extensive line of products sold for various aspects of convenience, refer to the majority of their products as FMCG.
* **SHOPPING PRODUCTS** In contrast to convenience products, shopping products are goods and services for which consumers will spend time and effort gathering information on price, product attributes, and product quality. **They are likely to compare alternatives before making a purchase.** Often consumers have little prior knowledge about these products. Because they gather new information for each purchase occasion, **consumers are only moderately brand-loyal and will switch whenver a different brand offers new or better benefits. They may visit several stores and devote consierable effort to comparing products. Laptop computers and digital cameras are good examples of shopping products because they offer an ever-expanding array of new features and functions. There are trade-offs and decisions to make about the price, speed, screen size, accuracy, weight, and battery life. Some shopping products have different characteristics. When people shop for attribute-based shopping products, such as a new party dress or a pair of designer shoes, they spend time and energy finding the best possible product selection. At other times, when choices available in the marketplace are just about the same, we consider these to be shopping products because of differences in price. For these price-based shopping products, determined shoppers will visit numerous stores in hopes of saving an additional $10 or $20.
* **SPECIALTY PRODUCTS** Consumers can buy a mop at Canadian Tire for well under $10, but sales of industrial carpet cleaners are brisk. Industrial carpet cleaners are good example of specialty products. **Specialty products have unique characteristics that are important to buyers at almost any price. Consumers usually know a good deal about specialty products, and they tend to be loyal to specific brands.** Generally a specialty product is an extended problem-solving purchase that requires a lot of effort to choose. That means that firms selling these kinds of products need to create marketing strategies that **make their products stand apart from the rest.** For example, advertising for a specialty product such as a flat-screen plasma TV may talk about plaasma's unique and superior characteristics, attempting to convince prospective customers that savvy shoppers won't accept a substitute such as a mere LCD screen.
* **UNSOUGHT PRODUCTS** Unsought products are goods or services (other than convenience products) for which a consuemr has little awareness or interest until a need arises. For university graduates with their first "real" job, retirement plans and disability insurance are unsought products. It requires a good deal of advertising or personal selling to interest people in these kinds of products. It is a real challenge to find convincing ways to interest cnosumers in unsought products. one solution may be to make pricing more attractive; for example, relutant consumers may be more willing to buy an unsought product for "only pennies a day" than if they have to think about their yearly or lifetime cash outlay.

### Business-to-Business Products
* Although consumers purchase products for thier own use, as we saw in Chapter 6 organization customers purchase items to use in the production of other goods and services or to facilitate the organization's operation. Marketers classify business-to-business products based on how organizational customers use them. **As with consuemr products, when marketers know how their business customers use a product, they are better able to design products and carft the entire marketing mix.** 
* **EQUIPMENT** Equipment refers to the products an organization uses in its daily operations. Heavy equipment, sometimes called installations or capital equipment, includes items such as building or robotics used to assemble automobiles. Installations are big-ticket items and last for a number of years. Computers, photocopy machines, and water fountains are example of light or accessory equipment; they are portable, cost less, and have a shorter lifespan than capital equipment. **Marketing strategies for equipment usually emphasize personal selling and may mean custom-designing products to meet an industrial customer's specific needs.**
* **MRO PRODUCTS** Maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) products are goods that a business customer consumes in a relatively short time. Maintenance products include light bulbs, mops, cleaning supplies, printing paper, and the like. Repair products are items such as nuts, bolts, washers, and small tools. Operating supplies include computer apper and oil to keep machinery running smoothly. **Although some firms use a sales force to promote MRO product, others reply on catalogue sales, the Internet, and telemarketing to keep prices as low as possible.**
* **RAW MATERIALS** Raw materials are products of the fishing, lumber, agricultural, and mining industries that organizational customers purchase to use in their finished products. For example, a food company may transform soybeans into tofu, and a steel manufacturer changes iron ore into large sheets of steel used by other firms to build aujtomobiles, washing machines, and lawn mowers.
* **PROCESSED MATERIALS AND SPECIAL SERVICES** Processed materials are purchased by organizations that use them as part of the product they make. A builder uses treated lumber to add a deck onto a house, and the company that create aluminum cans for Red Bull buys aluminum ingots for this purpose.
* In addition to tangible materials, some busienss customers purcahse specialized services from outside suppliers. Specialized services may be equipment-based, such as repairing a copy machine or fixing an assembly line malfunction, or non-equipment-based, such as market research and legal sercies. These services are essential to the operation of an organization but are not part of the production of a product.
* **COMPONENT PARTS** Component parts are manufactured goods or subassemblies of finished items that organizations need to commplete their own products. For example, a computer manufacturer needs silicon chips to make a commputer, and an automobile manufacturer needs batteries, tires, and fuel injectors. As with processed materials, marketing strategies for component parts usually involve nurturing relationships with customer firms and on-time delivery of a product that meets the buyer's specification

## IT"S "NEW AND IMPROVED!" UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATIONS
* "New and improved!" What exactly do we mean when we use the term new product? From a marketing standpoint, a new product or an innovation is anything that customers perceive as new and different. Innovations may be a cutting-edge style such as body piercing, a fad such as Beanie Babies, a new commmunications technology such as wireless communication, or a new product such as MP3 players. It may be a completely new product that provides benefits never available before, or it may simply be an existing product with a new style, in a different colour, or with some new feature. If an innovation is successful, it spreads through the population. First it is bought and used by only a few people, and then more and more consuemrs adopt it.
* Not all innovations are successful. Windows Millennium Edition was one of those products that failed. As a matter of fact, Windows me frequently makes the list of most disappointing products in history. The Millennium Edition came out between the highly successful Windows 98 and Windows 2000. It had few real features beyong Windows 98 and even rolled back a few options. it was considered unreliable by most and it was released along with the much more reliable Windows 2000. Still today, nobody knows if anything came out of Windows Me. Microsoft certainly learned from that dreadful experience.
* understanding innovations can be critical to the success of firms for at least two reasons. First, technology is advancing at a dizzy pace. Products are introduced and become obsolete faster than ever before. In mayn industries, firms are busy developing another new-and-better product before the last new-and-better product even hits store shelves. Nowhere is this more obvious than with personal commputers, where a steady change in technology makes consumers want a better, faster machine before the dust even settles on the old one. One company, Gateway, offers consumers a purchase plan that gives them the option of trading the machine in for a newere model every two years to make sure customers have what they want--and that they get it fromm Gateway.
* Another reason **why understanding new products is important is the high cost of developing them and the even higher cost of new products that fail.** In the pharmaceutical industry, the cost of bringing each new drug to market is between $200 and $500 million. Even the most successful firms can't affort many product failures with that kind of price tag.
* Marketers must understand what it takes to develop a new product successfully; **they must do their homework and learn what it is about existing products consumers find less than satisfactory and what exactly it will take to do a better job satisfying customer needs.** Savvy marketers know they'll waste a lot of investment if they don't.
* Finally, new product development is an importan contribution to society. We would never suggest that everything new is good, but many new products allow us to live longer, happier lives of better qulaity than before. Although there are some who disagree, most of us feel that our lives are better because of telephones, televisions, CD players, microwave ovens, and commputers--except when these items break down. We're not saying that firms create new products because they want to make our lives better--business create new products that make our lives better because that's how they make profits and keep their shareholders happy.

## Types of Innovations
* Innovations differ in their degree of newness, and this helps to determine how quickly the products will be adopted by many members of a target market. Because innovations that are more novel require greater effort and more changes in behaviour, they are slower to spread throughout a population that new products that are similar to what is already available.
* Marketers classify innovation into three categories based on their degree of newness; however, it is better to think of these three types as ranges along a continuum. The three types of innovations are based on the amount of disruption or change they bring to people's lives. For example, when the first automobiles were produced, they caused tremendous changes in the lives of their owners, far greater changes than when auto manufacturers introduced "new and improved" autos with automatic transmissions, air conditioning, and driving directions provided via satelite.
* **CONTINUOUS INNOVATIONS** A continuous innovation is modification to an existing product, such as masterCard's ability to handle busienss expense. This type of modifcation can set one brand apart from its competitors. Root has used continuous innovation in many of its product lines, adding a new style of leather jacket or a new neckline for a shirt. Most product innovatinos are continuous innovations. The term continuous tells us that the changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Small changes reposition the product or allow a manufacturer to offer product options.
* With a continuous innovation, the consumer doesn't have to learn anything new to use the innovation. From a marketing perspective, this means that it is far easier to convince consuemrs to adopt the innovation. A typewriter company, for example, many years ago modified the shape of its product to make it mroe "user friendly" to secretaries. One simple change was curving the tops of the keys, as we see on today's computer keyboards, because secretaries commpaimed that flat surfaces were hard to use with long fingernails. Today, computer manufacturers have gone a step further by building ergonomic keyboards that are less likely to cause painful wrist ailments.
* How different does a new product have to be from existing products? it is said that "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery", and **decisions regarding how much one's product should resemble those of competitors often are at the centre of marketing strategy development.** Sometimes, marketers feel that the best strategy is to follow the competition. For example, the packaging of "me-too" or look alike products, such as store-brand versions of national brands, **can create instant market success**, because consumers assume that similar packaging means similar products.
* A knock-off is a new product that copies, with slight modification, the design of an original product. Firms deliverately create knock-off of clothing, jewellery, or other items, **often with the intent to sell to a larger or different market.** For example, companies may copy the haute couture clothing styles of top designers and sell them at lower prices to the mass market. It is difficult to legally protect a design (as opposed to a technological invention), because it can be argued that even a very slight change--different buttons or a slightly wider collar on a dress or shirt--means the knock-off is not an exact copy. However, industry pressure is building for legal protection of designs. Manufacturers argue that a design element--say, a distinctive curve on a car bumper--is as important to the integrity of the car as a mechanical innovation.
* **DYNAMICALLY CONTINUOUS INNOVATIONS** A dynamically continuous innovation is a pronounced modification to an existing product that requires a modest amount of learning or chnage in behaviour to use it. The history of audio equipment is a series of dynamically continuous innovations. SKIM
* **DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATIONS** A discontinuous innovation creates major changes in the way we live. Example, airplane, car, television, personal computer
* Recognizing the degree of newness of innovations is important in developing marketing strategies. For example, **if marketers know that consumers may resist adopting a new and radically different product, they may offer consumers free product trial or place heavier enphasis on a personal selling strategy to convince consumers that the new product offers benefits worth the hassle.** Business-to-business marketers of technology products such as software, for instance, **often provide in-service training for employees of their customers who invest in new products**.

## ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION PROCESSES
* We've presented the steps marketers take to develop new products, from generating ideas to launch, and we have examined the importance of understanding innovations. Now, we'll look at what happens after that new product hits the market--how an innovation spreads throughout a population.
* New products do not satisfy customer needs until the customer uses them. Product adoption is the process by which a consumer or business customer begins to buy and use a new good, service, or idea. **The term diffusion describes how the use of a product spreads throughout a population. Once a product is bought by a small group of consumers, it may reach the moment of critical mass. The moment of truth in marketing is known as the tipping point. To reach that criical point, a marketer should understand the product adoption process.
* After months or even years spent developing a new product, a firm faces the challenge of getting consumers to buy and use the product--and to do so quickly --so that it can recover the costs of product development and launch. To accommplish this, marketers must understand the product adoption process. In this section, **we'll discuss the stages in the process, and how the characteristics of a product affect its adoption rate**--an important consideration for the introduction of new product.

### Stages in a Customer's Adoption of a New Product
* Whether the innovaitno is a new type of retail store or a better mousetrap, individuals and organizations pass through six stages in the adoption process. Figure below shows how a person goes from being unaware of an innovation through the stages of awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, adoption, and confirmation. At every stage, people drop out of the process, **so the proportion of consumers who wind up using the innovation on a consistent basis is a fraction of those who are exposed to it.**
* AWARENESS: Learning that the innovation exists is the first step in the adoption process. **To make consumers aware of a new product, marketers often conduct a massive advertising campaign, or media blitz.** Car companies use this approach to communicate to consumers that a new model has been introduced. This strategy works for new products when consumers see a new product as something they want and need and just can't live without.
* INTEREST for some of the people who become aware of a new product, a second stage in the adoption process is interest--a prospective adopter begins to see how a new product could satisfy an existing or newly realized need. Interest also means that consumers look for and are open to information about the innovation. Marketers often design teaser advertisements to give prospective customers just enough information about the new product to make them curious and to stimulate their interest. A recent ad for the telecommunications company Telus had billboards across Canadian cities featuring a very adorable pig. The billboards created a buzz, with people wondering whom the ads were for and what product it represented. It turned out that the ads were for new camera cellphones by Telus. Despite the marketers' best effort, though, some consumers drop out of the process at this point.
* The concept of different layers of a product discussed at the beginning of this chapter provides an excellent guide for marketers at this stage. Recall that consumers do not buy product features (attributes), they buy product benefits. **Therefore, smart marketers stress the product's benefits at this stage to generate interest. For example, when Goodyear introduced a new tire, the Aquatread, it stressed the fact that the tire would help drivers with superior traction in web conditions.**
* EVALUATIONL In the evaluation stage, a prospect weighs the costs and benefits of the new product. For complex, risky, or expensive products, people think about the innovation a great deal before trying it. For instance, a firm will carefully evaluate buying a $6000 video conferencing system before purchase. **Marketers for such products help prospective customers see how such products can benefit them--holding video conferences means a company doesn't have to pay travel costs for employees to attend central-location meetings.**
* However, little evaluation may occur with an impulse purchase. For example, consumers may do very little thinking before buying a chewing gum such as Dentyne Peppermint. For these products, marketers design the product and packing to be eye-catching and appealing to get consuemrs to notice the product quickly.
* Some potential adopters will evaluate an innovation positively enough to move on to the trial stage. Those who do not think the new product will provide adequate benefits drop out.
* TRIAL: The next stage in t he adoption process is trial--the potential adopters will actually experience or use the product for the first time. Often marketers stimulate trial by providing opportunities for consuemrs to sample the product. For example, when Barq's Root beer was introduced into the Canadian market, the company used a sampling team, the Barq's Brigades, to give consumers gree samples in stores and at sporting events to ensure that people tried the product. Based on the trial experience, some potential buyers move on to adoption of the new product.
* ADOPTION: **At the adoption stage, a prospect chooses a product. If the product is a consumer or business-to-business good, this means buying the product and learning how to use and maintain it. If the product is an idea, this means that the individual agrees with the new idea. For example, consumers who have adopted the idea that cycling helps protect our natural resources will carefully sort and recycle their glass, aluminum, plastic, and paper products.**
* This does not mean that all individuals or organizations that first choose an innovation are permanent customers, although many firms make this mistaken assumption. Some potential customers, even after initial adoption, do not go on to the final stage of confirmation. marketers need to provide follow-up contacts and communications with adopters to ensure that they are satisfied and remina loyal to the new product over time.
* CONFIRMATION: With initial adoption of an innovation, acustomer weighs expected versus actual benfits and costs. Favourable experiences contribute to new custommers becoming loyal adopters, as their initally positive opinions result in confirmation. Nothing lasts forever, hoever. Even loyal customers may decide that a new product is not meeting expectations and reject it. Some marketers feel that reselling the customer in the confirmation stage is important. **They provide advertisement, sales presentations, and other communications to reinforce a customer's choice.**

### The Diffusion of Innovations
* Diffusion describes how the use of a product spreads throughout a population. Marketers would prefer that their entire target market immediately adopt a new product, but this does not happen. Consumers and business customers differ in how eager or willing they are to try something new, lengthening the diffusion process by months or even years. Based on adopters' roles in t he diffusion process, experts have classified them into five different categories.
* ADOPTER CATEGORIES: Some people like to try new prodcuts. Others are so relutant, you'd think they're afraid of anything new. There are five categories of adopters: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. To understand how these differ, we'll study the adoption of one product-- the microwave oven.
* Innovators are roughly the first 2.5 percent of adopters. This segment is extremely adventurous and willing to take risks with new products. Innovators are typically well educated, younger, better off financially than others in the population, and worldly. Innovators who were into new technology knew all about microwave ovens before other people were aware they existed. Because innovators pride themselves on trying new products, they probably purchased microwaves when they were first introduced to the market in the mid 1970s.
* Early adopters approximately 13.5 percent of adopters, buy product innovations early as innovators. After reading articles in Consumer Reports and other sources of the microwave made their first purchase in the late 1970s. Unlike innovatiors, early adopters have greater concern for social acceptance. Typically, they are heavy media users and often are heavy users of a new product category. Others in the population often look to early adopters for their opinions on various topics, making them key to a new product's success. For this reason, marketers often target early adopters in developing advertising and other communications efforts. For example, early adopters of the Biore pore cleaning strips were young, 18- to 34-year-old women who were heavy readers of fashion magazines. Biore targeted this group with heavy advertising for the strips in fashion magazines and by giving out free samples at the Lilith Fair tour.
* The early majority about 34 percent of adopters, avoid being either first or last to try an innovation. They are typically middle-class consumers and are deliberate and cautious. Early majority consumers have slightly above average education and income levels. When the early majority adopts a product, it is no longer considered new or different--it is, in essence, already established. Early majority microwave owners made their purchase in the early and mid-1980s, by which time there were 10 to 15 brands of microwaves sold by a wide variety of retailers.
* The late majortiy adopters, about 34 percent of the population, are older, more conservative, and typically have lower than-average levels of education and income. the late majority adopters avoid trying a new product until it is no longer risky. By that time, the product has become an ecoonomic necessity, or there is pressure from peer groups to adopt. Late majority homes did not have a microwave until their friends began asking, "How can you survive without a microwave?" By that time, the price of the ovens had gone down, and the innovators, early adopters and even many of the early majority were purchasing a second or even a third microwave. To attract late majority buyers, marketers may offer low-priced models of a product.
* Laggards, about 16 percent of adopters, are the last in a population to adopt a new product. Laggards are typically lower in social class than other adopter categories and are bound by tradition. By the time laggards adopt a product, it may already be superseded by other innovations. 
* By understanding these adopter categoires, marketers are better able to develop strategies to speed the diffusion or widespread use of their products. For example, early in the diffusion process, marketers may put greater emphasis on advertising in special-interest magazine to attract innovators and early adopters. later they may lower the product's price or come out with lower-priced models with fewer features to attract the late majority. We'll discuss the strategies for new and existing products in the new chapter.
* **PRODUCT FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF ADOPTION**: If you could predict which new products will succeed and which will fail, you'd quickly be in high demand as consultant by companies worldwide. That's because companies make large investments in new products; but failures are all too frequent. Estimates of new product success rates range from 46 to 65 percent. Much research is devoted to making us smarter about new product success and failures. 
* Researchers have identified five characteristics of innovations that affect the rate of adoption. Figures below summarizes these factors: **relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability**. Whether a new product has each of these characteristics affects the speed of diffusion. As we've discussed, it took many years for the microwave to diffuse or spread throughout the Canadian population--from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. Examining these five factors helps us understand both why the new product was not adopted during its early years and why adoption spet up later.
* **Relative advantage** is **the degree to which a consumer perceives that a new product provides superior benefits**. In the case of the microwave oven, consumers in the 1960s and early 1970 did not feel that the product provided important benfits that would improve their lives. By by the late 1970s, that perception has changed, primarily because more women had entered the workforce. The 1960s woman had all day to prepare the evening meal--she didn't have a need for the microwave. But in the late 1970s, when many women left home for work at 8am and return home at 6pm, an appliance that would "magically" defrost a frozen chicken and cook it for dinner in 30 minute provided a genuine advantage.
* **Compatibility is the extend to which a new product is consistent with existing cultural values, customs, and practices**. Did consuemrs see the microwave oven as being compatible with existing ways of doing things? No. Cooking on paper plates? If you put a paper plate in a conventional oven, you'd likely get a visit from the fire department. By anticipating compatibility issues early in the new product development setage, marketing strategies can address such problems in planning commmunications programs, or there may be opportunities for altering product designs to overcome some consumer objections.
* **Complexity is the degree to which consumers find a new product or its use difficult to understand.** Many microwave users today haven't a clue about how a microwave oven cooks food. But when the product was introduced, consumers asked and marketers answered--microwaves cause molecules to move and rub together, creating frictino, which produces heat--cooked pot roast. But that explanation was complex and confusing for consumers for the 1960s.
* **Trialability is the ease of sampling a new product and its benefits.** Marketers took a very important step in the 1970s to speed up adoption of the microwave oven--product trial. Just about every store that sold microwaves invited shoppers to visit the store and see and sample an entire meal cooked in the microwave.
* Observability is **how visible a new product and its benefits are to others who might adopt it.** The ideal innovation is easy to see. For example, in-line skates gained instant attention, because walkers, runners, and bikers saw bladers zip by them on bike and jogging paths. The microwave was moderately observable. Only clsoe friends and acquaintances who visited someone's home could see whether the household had a microwave. Although marketers can't do much about the observability of new products--consumers are likely to keep their mattresses away from public viewing no matter what marketers do--they recognize that marketing strategies for new products that are not observable face diffciult challenges. They must develop a marketing mix that convinces consumers to invest in the product--even though no one else will know.

### Organizational Differences Affect Adoption
* Just as there are differences among consumers in their eagerness to adopt new products, businesses and other organizations are not alike in their willingness to buy and use new industrial products. Firms that welcome product innovations are likely to be younger companies, in highly technical industries, with younger managers and entrepreneurial corporate cultures. Early adopter firms are likely to be market-share leaders that adopt new innovations and try new ways of doing things to maintain their leadership. Firms that adopt new products only when they recognize they must innovate to keep up are in the early majority. Late majority firms tend to be oriented toward the status quo and often have large financial investments in existing production technology. Laggard firms are probably already losing money.
* Business-to-business products, like consumer prodcuts, can possess characteristics that will increase their likelihood of adoption. Organization are likely to adopt an innovation that helps them increase gross margins and profits. It is unlikely that firms would have adopted new products like voice mail unless they provide a way to increase profit by reducing labour costs. Organizational innovations are attractive when they are consistent with a firm's ways of doing business. Cost is also a factor in the new products firms will adopt. Firms are more likely to accept a new prodcut if they perceive the improvement to be large in relation to the investment they will have to make.

Marketing Concepts: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. This chapter discuss the core prodcut, functional product, augmented product, and potential product. Does this mean that marketers are simply trying to make products that are really the same seem different? When marketers understand these four layers of the product and develop products with this concept in mind, what are the benefits to consumers? What are the benefits to marketers?
2. Can you provide examples of core versus potential products? How easy or hard was it for you to come up with these examples? Do you find your thinking about product strategy (and building competitive advantage, in general) has cahnged as a result of learning these concepts?
3. Some people argue that there is no such a thing as a tangible good; everything is a service (that is, an experience) What do you think/ What are some advantage and disadvantage of such thinking?
4. The phrase "new and improved" has been used so many times that, for many people, it is meaningless. Why has this occurred? What challenge does this present to marketers?
5. Discontinuous innovations are totally new products--something seldom seen in the marketplace. What are some examples of discontinuous innovations introduced in the past 50 years? What do you think the future holds for new products? Will they be continnuous or discontinuous innovations?
6. This chapter explained that knock-offs are slightly modified copies of original product designs. Should knock-offs be illegal? Who is hurt by knock-offs? Is the marketing of knock-offs good or bad for consumers in the short run? In the long run?
7. It is not necessarily true that all new prodcuts benefit consumers or society. What are some new products that have made our lives better? What are some new products that have actuall been harmful to consumers or to society? Should there be a way to monitor new products that are introduced to the marketplace?

Marketing Practice: Applying What You've Learned
1. Assume that a firm marketing a new low-calorie, fat free chocolate candy bar has recently hired you. Because of your knowledge of new product adoption, you know that consumers go through a series of stages in adopting new product--awareness, interest, and so on. You also realize that it is important for marketers to "help" customers move from one stage to the next. Develop your recommendations for marketing activities that would be appropriate for each stage in the adoption process.
2. As a member of a new product team with your company, you are working with engineers in developing the world's first practical, battery-powered automobile. You know that different product characteristics (relative advantage, compatibility, and so on) influence the speed of adoption of the product. Considering such product characteristics, make a list of suggestions for the engineers (or for the marketing department) that will speed the adoption of the new product when it is introduced.
3. Assume that you are employed in the marketing department of the firm in the preceding example. How would you use your knowledge of goods and services to communicate the benefits of this car? Can you think in terms of core versus potential products when you provide your answer?
4. Firms go to great lengths to develop new product ideas. Someimtes new ideas come from brainstorming, in which groups of individuals get together and try to think of as many different, novel, creative--and hopefully profitable--dieas for a new product as possible. With a group of other students, participate in brainstorming for new product ideas for one of the following (or somme other product of your choice). a. an exercise machine; b. computer software; c. a new type of college or university. Then, with your class, screen one or more of the ideas for possible further product development.

Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing
* What product characteristics do consumers think are important in a new product? What types of service components do they demand? And most important, how do marketers know how t odevelop successful new products? This mini-project is designed to let you experiecne making some of these decisions.
1. Create (in your mind) a new product item (a good or service) that might be of interest to students like you. Develop a written description and possibly a drawing of this new product
2. Show this new product description to a number of your fellow students who might be potential users of the product. Ask them to tell you what they think of the product. Some of the questions you might ask them are:

        a. What is your overall opinion of the new product?
        b. What basic benefits would you expect to receive from the product?
        c. What about the physical characteristics of the product? What do you like? Dislike? What would you add? Delete? Change?
        d. What do you like (or would you like) in the way of product packaging? (if the product is a service, think how you would communicate its existence and benefits)
        e. What sort of services would you expect to receive with the product?
        f. Do you think you would try the product? How could marketers influence you to buy the product

3. Develop a report based on what you found. Include your recommendations for changes in the product and your feelings about the potential success of the new product.

Real people, Real Surfer: Exploring the Web
* Visit the websites for three fashion retailers: Root(www.roots.com), the Gap(www.gap.com), and le Chateau (www.lechateau.ca). After you have visited teh company webistes, explore the internet for additional information on each firm. Based on your experience on the Internet, answer the following questions:
1. Describe the number and variety of consumer and busienss-to-business products each company produces
2. Is an emphasis on product development evident in the description of the companies from their websites?
3. Does the webstie provide opportunities for consumers to purchase products? To provide input about existing products? To offer new product ideas?
4. What can you find out about each firm's new product development process? How does the process lead to extraordinary new products?
5. What is your evaluation of each website? Does the website focus more on the comapny's products or on some other aspect of the company? Does it provide easy access to important information about the company's products? What visitors would be attracted to the website? Is the website designed  in such a way as to encourage visitors to return to the site?

# CHAPTER 8: Product Management

## THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE AND THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
* Product life cycle management is an all-encompassing vision for managing all data linked to design, production, support, and ultimate disposal of manufactured goods. In marketing, the product life cycle concept was first used where safety and control were extremely critical, notably in the military and aerospace industry. Product life cycle management is part of the process of commpetitive positioning and finding market opportunities. Proper decisions related to the product life cycle will **maximize the return at every stage by adapting or retiring unprofitable and introducing new ones**.

## MARKETING THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
* The zipper, redesigned by Swedish-American Gideon Sundback in 1913, is an example of a hunble, low-tech product that has managed to live an exceptional ly long life. Altough the zipper was invented in the 1800s, it was not used in men's clothing until the 1930s. These "hookless fasteners", as they were once called, were originally intended for use on high-buttoned shoes. it took time for them to be used in men's trousers, because competitors argued that this "newfangled gadget" could result in serious injuries. In 1936, the Price of Wales adopted the zipper and was the first monarch to "sit on a throne bezippered".
* Like the zipper, many products have very long lives. The **product life cycle** is a useful way to look at how product features change over the life of a product. In Chapter 7, we discussed objectives of product decisions, the product concept, and how marketers introduce new products; but launching a product is only the beginning. Product marketing strategies must evolve as they continue through the product life cycle.
* The concept of the product life cycle does not relate to a single brand but to the generic product category. Thus, we talk about the life cycle of personal computers, not Compaq computers, of automobiles, not the Focus. Some individual brands have short life expectancies: Who remembers the Bricklin car or Evening in Paris perfume? Others seem almost immortal: Think of such brands as Campbell's soup, Ivory Soap, or American Express.

### The Introduction Stage
* We can divide the life of a product into four separate stages. The first stage of the product life cycle, **as figure below, is introduction--customers get their first chance to purchase the good or service. During this early stage, a single company usually produces the product. If the product is accepted and profitable, competitors will follow with their own versions.**

        -Introduction Stage: No profits because the company is recovering R&D costs
        -Growth stage: profits increase and peak
        -Maturity stage: Sales peak and profit margins narrow
        -Decline stage: market shrinks, and sales fall, and profit fall

* **During the introduction stage, the goal is to get first-time buyers to try the product. Sales (hopefully) increase at a steady but slow pace.** As shown below, **the company does not make a profit during this stage, due to research and development (R&D) costs and heavy spending for advertising and other promotion.**

        Characteristic: Introduction->Growth->Maturity->Decline

        Product: Single company produces single product->new commpetitors enter the market, creating new variations of the product-> New features added: Sales are mostly replacement products->number of variations reduce

        Goals: Get first-time buyers to try the product-> Encourage brand loyalty-> Attract new users-> Remain profitable, decide whether to keep or phase product out

        Sales: Increase at a steady but slow pace-> Rapid increase-> Peak, then level off, often decline-> Continue to decline

        Profit: Negative-> Increase and peak->Profit margins narrow-> Declining

        Pricing: High: recover R&D costs; Low: attract large numbers of customers-> May need to reduce because of increased competition -> Price to maintain market share -> May reduce if can remain profitable

        Market Communication: Informing customers -> Heavy advertising to counter new competition -> Reminder advertising -> Decreased to maintain profitability

* Pricing may be high to recover the R&D costs (demand permitting) or low to attract large numbers of consumers. The Hitachi advertisement is designed to appeal to consumers who are willing to pay for the latest technological advances.
* For a new product to be successful, consuemrs must first know about it and believe that it is something they need. Thus, marketing during the introduction stage often focuses on informing consumers about the product, how to use it, and its benfits.
* How long does the introduction stage last? For the microwave oven, it was several years. How long the introduction stage lasts depends on a number of factors, including marketplace acceptance and producer willingness to support the product during its startup. In the case of the microwave, sales in countries such as Japan were much stronger, because the companies supported the product through its long introduction stage.
* Not all products make it past the introduction stage. In fact, the failure rate for new products has been cited to be as high as 90 percent. One of the most noted examples of products that never got past the introduction stage is the Ford Edsel automobile. Introduced in 1957 and named after the only son of Ford's founder, the Edsel was designed to compete with such cars as the Chrysler New Yoker. It boasted high horsepower, tail fins, three-tone paint jobs, wraparound windshilds, a "horse-collar" girlle, and a push-button gearshift. The problem was that consumers didn't like the Edsel. Only 110847 Edsels were made before Ford abandoned the car, making the word Edsel synonymous with product failure.

### The Growth Stage
The second stage in the product life cycle, the growth stage, sees a rapid increase in sales while profit increase and peak. Marketing's goal here is to encourage brand loyalty by convincing the market that this brand is suerprior to others in the category. **In this stage, marketing strategies may include the introduction of product variations to attract market segments and grow market share. When competitors appear, marketers must use heavy advertising and other types of promotion. Price competition may develop, driving profits down. Some firms may seek to capture a particular segment of the market by positioning their product to appeal to a certain group.**

### The Maturity Stage
The maturity stage of the product life cycle is usually the longest. Sales peak and then begin to level off and even decline while profit margins narrow. Competition grows intense when remaining competitors fight for a piece of a shrinking pie. Because most customers have already accepted the product, sales are often to replace a worn-out item or to take advantage of product improvements. For example, almost everyone owns a televisions, so commpanies typically sell new TVs to consumers whose sets have broken down. During the maturity stage, firms try to sell their product through all suitable retailers, because product availability is crucial in a very commpetitive market. Consuemrs will not go far to find one brand when others are closer at hand.
* To remina competitive and maintain market share during the maturity stage, firms amy tinker with the marketing mix, coming out with new version of the product that include new features. For example, television manufacturers try to invigorate sales with flat-screen TVs. Warner-Lambert Canada introduced Listerine oral care strips, the first product extension of Listerine mouthwash. The strips offer the same breath freshening benefit of the original Listerine, but are small and dissolve in the mouth, thereby making the Listerine product portable and offering consuemrs a new benefit.
* Attracting new users of the product is another strategy used in the maturity stage. As we saw in Chapter 7, market development means introducing an existing product to a market that doesn't currently use it. Many Canadian firms are finding new markets for their products in countries around the world. To find new users for their products, firms in the Canadian wine industry, for example, have been actively pursuing markets in Pacific Rim countries such as Korea and China.

### The Decline Stage
* The decline stage of the product life cycle is characteristized by a decrease in product category sales. This is often because new technology has made the product obsolete, as when computer caused the decline of the typewriter. Although a single firm may still be profitable, the market as a whole begins to shrink, profits decline, and suppliers pull out. In this stage, there are usually many competitors with no one having a distinct advantage. 
* A firm's major product decision in t he decline stage is whether to keep the product. Once the product is no longer profitable, it drains resources from the firm--resources that could help develop newer products. **If the decision is to drop the product, elimination can be handled in two ways: Phase it out by cutting production in stages and letting existing stocks run out, or drop the rpoduct immediately.** If the established market leader anticipates that there will be somem residual demand for the product for a long time, it may make sense to keep the product on the market. The idea is to sell a limited quanity of the product with little or no support from sales, merchandising, advertising, and distribution, and let it "wither on the vine". Somme classic products have been able to hang on with little or no market support. For example, the Hilti launched its power-actuated fastening system program in 1948. Despite sleeker and less costly competitors, the Hitlti "shot-gun" maintains its reputation as the heavy-duty tool.

## SERVICE STRATEGY
* Once a product strategy is established, it is important to recognize that any product needs to be supported by a sound service strategy. To offer good-quality service, any firm should reconigze that **the main parameter in a service strategy is time**, dealing with the "before", "during", and "after" phases of a product delivery. For the "before" phase, to obtain full value **firms need to provide relevant information about the product offered, rangin from schdules to operating instructions, user warning instructions, and price. In addition, a dialogue with customers is essential to meet customer requirements and develop a tailored solution. Soon after, the firm should make it easy for customers to place orders. This might sound obvious, but many firms forget that the choice of communication channels, time, and location should be convenient for customers to place an order**. For example, servers in many restaurants are now taking orders with a handheld wireless device to provide better and faster service.
* For the "during" phase, **the delivery, installation, and guarantees offered are key elements in the service offered by the firm. This step includes proper billing and payment requirement practices.** Finally, in the "after" phase, firms should provide after sales service that includes maintenance and repair support. This phase is critical in **that firms need to allow customers to give feedback on the quality of the service.** In turn, that feedback can be used to make future readjustments.

## CREATING PRODUCT IDENTITY: BRANDING DECISIONS
* Knowing the stage of their product in the product life cycle helps marketers successfully manage the product. Equally important is giving that product an identity: Branding is an extremely important element of product strategies. In this section, we examine what a brand is, the importance of branding, and how firms make branding decisions.

### What's in a Name (Or a Symbol)?
* How do you identify your favorite brand? By its name? By the logo (how the name appears)? By the packaging? by some graphic image or symbol, such as Canadian Tire's red triangle and green maple leaf? A brand is a name, term, symbol, or any other unique element of a product that identifies one firm's product(s) and sets it apart from the competition. Consumers easily recognize the Coca-Cola logo, the pink Energizer bunny (a trade character), and the triangular blue Nabisco logo (a brand mark) in the coner of the box. Branding provides the reconition factor products need to succeed in regional, national, or international markets.
* **CHOOSING A BRAND NAME, MARK, OR CHARACTER** There are several important consideration in selecting a brand name, brand mark, or trade character. It must have a positive connotation and be memorable. Consider Toro's experience when it introduce a lightweight snow thrower called the "snow Pup". Sales were disappointing, because "pup" conveyed a small, cuddly, animal, not a desirable image for a snow thrower. Renamed the "Snow Master", its sales went up markedly.
* A brand name is probably the most used and most recognized form of branding. Kool-Aid, a word that most kids know, has been used to maintain a long-term relationship with consuemrs. Kool-Aid now markets ice tea versions of its beverages to appeal to adult tastes.
* A good brand name can position a product by conveying a certain image or personality (Molson Canadian) or describing how it works (Drano), or else it may be ambiguous, such as Exxon, Ajax, and Lotus. Brand names sometimes need to change over time. For example, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC when "fried" went out of style, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce became CIBC to avoid the use of "imperial", and for similar reasons the Hudson's Bay Company became HBC.
* How does a firm select a good brand name? **Good brand designers say there are four "easy" test: easy to say, easy to spell, easy to read, and easy to remember. Consider P&G's Tide, Cheer, Gain, Downy, and Ivory Snow. And the name should also "fit" four ways: fit the target market, fit the product's benefits, fit the customer culture, and fit legal requirements.** When the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada decided to change its brand name, it chose a very non-traditional name for the insruance market: Clarica. A multimillion-dollar advertising campaign supported the name change, but the name was criticized by many marketers for, among other things, sounding more like a skin cleanser than an insurance company. 
* When it comes to graphics for a brand symbol, name, or logo, the rule is: it must be recognizable and memorable. No matter how small or how large, the triangular Nabisco logo in the corner of the box is a familiar sight. And it should have visual impact. This means that from across a store or when you are quickly flipping the pages in a magazine, the brand will catch your attention. One product that made the wrong kind of visual impact with its brand name was a snack product called HITS. it was on the shelves for only a short time, because the manufacturer realized that when the packages were were put end to end on store shelves, the logos produced an unintended effect: HitsHitsHitsHitsHits.
* Some marketers enhance brand recognition by creating a trade character, such as the Pilsbury Dough Boy, the Jolly Green Giant, or Mr. Clean. A&W uses the Root Bear to strengthen brand reconition.
* TRADEMARK: The legal term for a brand name, brand mark, or trade character is trademark. Marketers can legally register brands as trademarks to make their use by compeititors illegal in Canada. However, it is possible for a firm to have protection for a brand even if it has not legally registered it. Common-law protection exists if the firm has used the name and established it over a period of time. Although a registered trademark prevents other from using on a similar product, it may not bar its use for a product in a completely different type of business.

### The Importance of Branding
* Marketers spend vast amounts of money on new product development, advertising, and promotions to develop strong brands. If successful,  the investment creates **brand equity**, which is a brand's value to its organization. Brand equity means that a brand has **high customer loyalty, perceived quality, and brand name awareness**. For a firm, brand equity provides a competitive advantage, because it gives the brand **the power to capture and hold onto a large share of the market and to sell at prices with higher profit margins**. Somme of the most valuable brands in teh world are BMW, Nike, Nokia, and Ikea.

        Research shows that the following factors make a brand successful:
        -The brand excels at delivering the benefits customers truly desire.
        -The brand stay relevant.
        -The pricing strategy is based on consuemrs' perceptions of value.
        -The brand is properly positioned.
        -The brand is consistent
        -The brand portfolio and hierarchy make sense.
        -The brand makes use of and coordinates a full range of marketing activities to build equity.
        - The brand is given proper support, and that support is sustained over the long run.
        -The company monitors source of brand equity.

* When brands possess strong brand equity, they provide important opportunities for a firm. A firm leverage a brand's equity with **brand extension**, new prodcut sold with the same brand name, such as Listerine oral care strips and Dentyne Ice mentioned earilier. If existing brand equity is high, the firm is able to sell the brand extension at a higher price than if it had given it a new brand, and the brand extension will attract new customers immediately. However, if the brand extension does not live up to the quality or attractiveenss of the original brand, brand equity will suffer, reducing brand loyalty and sales.

### Branding Strategies
* As marketing strategists know, brands are important to a marketing program's success, so decisions about branding strategies are a major part of product decision making. Marketers have to determine whether to create individual or family brands, national or private-label brands, or to co-brand.
* **INDIVIDUAL BRANDS VERSUS FAMILY BRANDS** Part of developing a branding strategy is deciding whether to use a separate, unique brand for each product item--*an individual brand strategy*--or to market multiple items under the same brand name--a family brand--an umbrella brand strategy. Individual brands may do a better job of communicating clearly and concisely what the consuemr can expect from the product, whereas family brands allow a firm to develop a brand for an entire product line. Thus, **the decision to use an individual or family branding strategy often depends on characteristics of the product and whether the company's overall product strategy calls for introduction of a single, unique product or for the development of a group of similar products.** Pillsbury Canada uses family branding with its Green Giant, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, underwood, and Accent family brands Under the Old El Paso name are such Mexican foods as salsa and Machips; under its Green Giant name are frozen and canned vegetables and other frozen products; and under the Pillsbury name are Pizza Pops, Toaster Strudel, and refrigerated baked goods.
* **NATIONAL AND STORE BRANDS** Retailers today are often in the driver's seat when it comes to deciding what brands to sell. In addition to choosing from producers' brands like those from Pillsbury Canada, called **national or manufacturer brands**, retailers decide whether to offer their own versions. **Store brands**, also called **private-label brands**, are the retail store's or chain's exclusive trade name. Loblaws, for example, sell its President's Choice private label brand along with national brands.
* Retailers choose a private-label branding strategy because they generally make a larger profit than on national brands. Private-label strategies are also important when retailers seek to maintain a consistent store image; for example, clothing retailers such as Gap and Holt Renfrew protect their image by offering store brands. The British Columbia company Private Reserve Water produces private-label water for such companies as Holiday Inn Express, and several golf clubs, restaurants, and catering companies across North America.
* **LICENSING** Some firms choose to use licensing to brand their products. A licneising agreemtn typically means that one firm sells another firm the right to use a brand name for a specific purpose and for a specific period of time. Forms choose a licensing strategy for a variety of reasons: Sometimes it provides instand recognition and consumer interest in a new product; at other times licensing is important in positioning a product for a certain target market. For example, bourbon maker Jack Daniels licensed its name to T. Marzetti for producing Jac Daniels bourbon-flavoured mustard. Much better known, however, is t he licensing of entertainment names. Movie producers license their properities to manufacturers of a seeminly infinite number of products: When Disney movies hit the screens, such licensed merchandise as figures, toys, and clothing are sole through stores and distributed through other retail outlets such as McDonald's.
* **CO-BRANDING** Starbucks cafe in Chapters stores and McDonald's outlets in Walmart stores are both examples of co-branding. Co-branding, which some call one of the "pre-eminent marketing strategies" today, joins two brands in partnership to market new or existing products. Co-branding ideally benefits both partners--in combination, the two brands can enjoy more recognition power than either would alone. Starbucks and Chapters products, for example, are complementary and appeal to the same target group, so by co-branding, both brands are strengthened.

## ORGANIZING FOR EFFECTIVE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
* Firms don't create great brands, people do. Like all elements of the marketing mix, the effectiveness of product strategies depends on marketing managers and the decisions they make. In this section, we discuss how firms organize for the management of existing products and for the development of new products.

### Management of Existing Products
* In small firms such as The Body Blocker Group, the marketing function may be handled by a single marketing manager, **who is responsible for new product planning, advertising, making website decisions, marketing research, and just about everything else.** The Body Blocker simply is not big enough--and doesn't need--a large marketing management team.
* In larger firms with many products, **a number of managers are responsible for different brands, product categories, or markets. Depending on the organization, product management may include brand managers, product category managers, and market managers.**
* **BRAND MANAGERS** Sometimes a firm has different brands within a single product category. For example, General Foods produces several brands of coffee, including Brim, Maxim, Maxwell House, International Coffees, Sanka, and Yuban. In such cases, a separate brand manager may be responsible for each brand.
* Procter & Gamble brand managers once acted independently and were responsible for coordinating all marketing activities for a brand: positioning, identifying target makrets, research, distribution, sales promotion, packaging, and evalujating the success of these decisions. Today, P&G's brand managers are more like team leaders. They are still responsible for positioning brands and developing brand equity, but they are likely to work with sales, finance, and logistics staff members as a part of customer business teams working with major retail accounts.
* The brand management system has its problems. Acting independently, brand managers may fight for increases in short-term sales for their own brand. They may push too hard with coupons, cent-off packages, or other price incentives to a point where customers will refuse to buy the product without them. They can hurt long term brand equity and profitability
* **PRODUCT CATEGORY MANAGERS** Some larger firms have such diverse product offerings that there is a need for extensive coordination. Eastman Kodak is best known for its cameras, firlm, and other photography supplies; however, it also markets printers, optical disks, and photocopies. In such cases, organizing for product management may include product category managers, who coordinate the mix of product lines within the more general product category and who consider the addition of new product lines. In recent years, both Procter & Gamble and Lever Brothers have consolidated brands under product category managers, who are responsible for profit and losses within the category.
* **MARKET MANAGERS** Some firms have developed a market manager structure, in which different managers focus on specific customer groups rather than on the products the company makes. This type of organization can be useful for firms that offer a variety of products serving the needs of a wide range of customers. For example, Raytheon, which specialize in consumer electronics products, special-mission aircraft, and business aviation, sells some products directly to consumer markets, others to manufacturers, and still others to government.

### Organizing for New Product Development
* In Chapter 7 (Product Strategy), we discussed the importance of new products to the long-term health of an organization. Because launching new products is so important, the management of launching them is too. In some instances, one person handles new product development. However, in larger organizations, new product development almost always needs many people working under the new product manager.
* The challenge in large companies is to get specialists in different areas to work together in venture teams, in which members focus exclusively on the new product development effort. The venture team may be located away from traditional company offices, perhaps in a separate building, called a skunk works. This odd term suggests that the group avoids opponents of change within the firm who might stop a project that challenges the status quo. Often having team members with different areas of knowledge, for example, design, engineering, and marketing, contributes to creativity and breaktrhough ideas.
* Whirlppol, the appliance commpany, can thank its venture team for winning #30 million in a nationwide save-energy refrigerator design contest sponsored by a group of electric utilities. The seven-person Whirlpool team developed a refrigerator that was 25 percent more energy efficient and did not use ozone-depleting chloroflurocarbons. Runner-up Frigidaire also used a team approach and discovered that the timme it needed for new product development was cut in half.

5. List and explain somme of the different brand strategies.
6. Describe some ways firms organize the marketing function to maange existing products. What are the ways firms organize for the development of new products?

Marketing Concepts: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. Firms often take advantage of a popular, well-known brand by developing brand extensions, because they know that the brand equity of the original or parent brand will be transferred to the new product. However, the transfer can go the other way. If a new product is of poo quality, it can damage the reputation of the parent brand. A new product that is of superior quality can enhance the parent brand's reputation. What are some brand extensions that have either damaged or enhanced the parent brand equity?

Marketing Practice: Applying What You've Learned
1. Assume you are the vice-president of marketing for a firm that markets a large number of specialty food items, such as gourmet sauces, marinades, and relishes.

        a. Your firm is interested in improving its marketing management structure. You are considering several alternatives: a brand manager structure, having product line management, or focusing on market managers. Outline the advantages and disadvantages of each type of organization. What is your recommendation
        b. Your firm is also interested in aggressively pursuing the development of a number of new products. You have been asked to develop recommendations for organizing this new product development. Prepare a report that outlines your recommendation.

2. Assume you are working in the marketing department of a major manufacturer of athletic shoes. Your firm is introducing a new product, a line of disposable sports clothing. You wonder if it would be better to market the line of clothing with a new brand name or use the family brand name, which has already gained popularity with your existing products. Make a list of advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. Develop your recommendation.

Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing
* In any supermarket, you will find examples of all the different types of brands discussed in this chapter: individual brands, family brands, national brands, store brands, and co-branded and licensed products. This mini-project is designed to give you a better understanding of branding as it exists in the marketplace.

                1. Go to a supermarket in your community
                2. Select two product categories of interest to you, for example, ice cream, cereal, laundry detergent, soup, or paper products.
                3. Make a list of the brands available in each product category. Identify what type of brand each is. Count the number of shelf facing (the number of product items at the front of each shelf) for each brand
                4. Arrange to talk with the store manager at a time that is convenient for him/her. Ask the manager to discuss:
                        a. How the store decides which brands to carry.
                        b. whether the store is more likely to carry a new individual brand or a new family brand
                        c. what causes a store to drop a brand
                        d. the profiability of store or private-label brands versus national brands.
                        e. other aspects of branding that the store manager sees as important from a retail perspective
                5. Present a report to your class on what you learned about the brands in your two product categories.

# CHATPER 9: PRICING STRATEGY

## "YES, BUT WHAT DOES IT COST?"
As Leonard Hendricks and the management team at Telus understand, the question of what to charge for a product is a central part of marekting decision making. What to charge for a product, whether it is a good, service, or idea, is a key strategic decision. In this chapter, we'll examine the set of decisions associated with the price element of the marketing mix, how those decisions are made, and the role of demand, costs, revenues, and the environment in the pricing decision process. We will start by discussing what price is, why pricing decision is important, and the context in which pricing decisions are made. Then, wewill examine pricing objectives, pricing policy (or strategy), price points and tactics, and implementation terms and conditions--which collectively are the key pricing decisions. These key decisions are illustrated in figure below. The chapter concludes with  a discussion of environmental influences on pricing decisions

        Price Objectives->Pricing Policy/Strategies->Price Points&Tactics-> Implementation: Terms & Conditions: Legal Consideration

### Monetary and Non-Monetary Prices
* "If you have to ask how much it is, you can't afford it!" We have all heard that, but how often do you buy something without asking the price? if we weren't concerned about price, we'd all drive dream cars, take trips to exotic places, and live like royalty. Most of us, however, need to consider a product's price before buying. Price is the value that customers give up, or exchange, to obtain a desired product. Payment may be in the form of money, goods, services, favours, votes, or anything else that has value to the other party.
* As Chapter 1 explained, marketing is the process that creates exchange of things of value. We usually think of this exchange as people trading money for a good or a service. Often, the monetary value of a product is called something other than price, sometimes to hide the idea that you are being charged a price or perhaps to assume an airof greater respectability. For example, college and university charge tuition for an education, alawyer or accountant charges a professional fee, and students who join a chapter of the American Marketing Association pay dues. No matter what it is called, it's still a price.
* But in some marketplace practices, price can mean exchanges of non-monetary value. Long before society minted coins, people exchanged one good or service for another. This practice of bartering was the basis for Northwest trappers for furs. Bartering still occurs tody, and with advances in Internet technology, it's increasing at more than 20 percent per year. An estimated 450,000 North Amercian business barter $10 billion worth of goods and services each year. That is in addition to the thousands more people who informally exchange everything from spaghetti sauce to music lessons. Canadian organizations such as the Barter Network (based in Toronto) and the Community Exchange System (based in Quebec) have established large barter networks, where organizations can exchange goods and services for barter credits. Someone who owns a home at a mountain ski resort, for example, may exchange a weekend for barter credits to spend in a restaurant or for car repairs. In fact, in 2006, a Vancouver-based blogger named Kyle MacDonald managed to use multiple barters to trade a paper clip for a rural house in Saskatchewan. No money changes hands, but as the Canada Revenue Agency understands well, there is an exchange of value: Taxpayers are supposed to report as income the value of goods or services received in exchange for other goods or services.
* Organizations that follow an operational excellence strategy (Chapter 3) or another cost-based differentation strategy focus on making the cost to the customer as low as possible. These also include non-monetary costs. When evaluating purchase alternatives, consumers take into account other economic costs such as **operating costs, switching costs, and opportunity costs. Operating costs are those involved in using the product, such as toner in a printer. Switching costs are involved in moving from one brand to another, such as getting new cheques printed if you switch banks. Opportunity costs are the benefits and value you give up, or miss out on, by engaging in one activity or buying one product and not another, such as the income you forgo while in school.
* Sometimes the lowest-priced product isn't the lowest-cost over time. The personal investment consumers make in buying and using products is also a cost. Convenience-store operators, suchas Mac's or 7-Eleven, and Internet companies, such as Chapters.ca, among other marketers, focus on minimizing the time, energy, and effort consumers have to expend to satisfy their needs and wants. As discussed in Chapter 5, consumers also experience psychological costs--such as stress, hassle, cognitive, difficulty, and cognitive dissonance--when trying to buy and use products. (Have you ever tried to assemble a bike or gas barbecue?) Many marketers, atomalls, and courier companies, for example, focus on making it as easy as possible to buy and use their products. Psycholoical costs are particularly challenging when marketing ideas, such as not smoking. Health Canada uses shocking or disturbing images to increase the perceived psychological cost of smoking. 

### The Importance of Pricing Decisions
* How important are good pricing decisions? Pricing is probably the least understood and least aprpeciated element of the marketing mix. Marketers like to talk about advertising and other communication elements. It's fun to think about changing technology and how firms invest in new-product development. Even decisions about channels of distribution seem to invest in new-product development. Even decisions about channels of distribution seem to be more exciting than setting the right price. Yet price has a major strategy impact on the firm--it determines the net value recevied by the customer in an exchange (benefits minus costs) versus the net value (profit) received by the firm.
* The plight of U.S. airlines is a good example of how bad pricing decisions can hurt an entire industry. During the decade before 1992, companies in the airline industry engaged in a fierce price war. The per-mile fare was lowered nearly 25 percent (accounting for inflation of the dollar), while costs such as labour and fuel more than doubled. As a result, from 1990 to 1992, the airlines lost over $10 billion, more than had been earned since the start of commercial air travel. Sometimmes it's not advantageous for a firm to cut its prices. The industry rebounded in 2006 with strong ticket sales, and industry experts expected 2007 to be even stronger--as more people travel. Despite this rebound, airlines are still not making much money and industry experts predict that if the economy slows down, more airlines may have to file for bankrupcy. The industry is still feeling the impact of the pricing decisions of the early 1990s.
* Good pricing decisions are critical to a firm's success in the marketplace. For most organizations, the only source of profit is through the price charged for products. If customers are not willing to pay the price asked for a firm's product, t he firm will not make a profit and will have failed its shareholders
* Even during the best economic timems, most consumers rank "reasonable price" as the most important consideration in a purchase. In addition, reasonable prices count most when consumers decide when to shop. Price is even more important during recessions, when consumers have less to spend and count their pennies carefully. Marketers try to come as close to reasonable as possible when deciding on a price.
* Individual consumers aren't the only buyers who focus on price. As we saw in Chapter 6, purchasing agents for firms often put a high priority on getting the best price. At least one study has found that price may be second only to quality in these decisions. Buying professionals know that when all else is equal, getting a low price keeps costs down and helps make their firm's product competitive.

## DEVELOPING PRICING OBJECTIVES
* Pricing objectives must support the broader objectives of the firm, such as maximizing shareholder value, as well as its overall marketing objectives, such as increasing market share. Consider, for example, the different pricing decisions fo the three major rivals in the breakfast cereal market.
* In the 1980s, major cereal producers increased net prices more than 6 percent per year for a total of 30 percent over a five-year period. Then came the low-priced supermarket brands, which, by the mid 1990s, had captured 9 percent of the market. In response, the top two makers of ready-to-eat cereals announced very different pricing strategies. General Mills cut prices on three of its major brands in the large sizes in an effort to increase its market share. Kellogg's response, however, was a 2.6 percent price increase on its cereals, it planned to soften the impact with discount coupons, the idea being to hold customers and to increase profits with frequent price-oriented promotions. Three years later, in 1996, Post announced it was "changing the way the entire cereal category works" with an across-the-board price rollback, and, at the same time, initiating a new advertising campaign. Each of these pricing strategies had an objective: General Mills sought to increase market share, Kellogg tried to increase profits, and Post hoped to increase consumers' total consumption of cereal. Table below provides examples of different types of pricing objectives.

                Type of objective | Example
                Profit: During the first six months, set a price to yield a target profit of $200,000
                or
                Set prices to allow for an 8 percent margin on all goods sold

                Sales or Market Share: Institute pricing strategy changes to support a 5 percent increase in sales

                Competitive Effect: After pricing strategy during the first quarter of the year to increase sales during introduction of a new product
                Or 
                Maintain low-end pricing policies to discourage new competitors from entering the market

                Customer Satisfaction: Simplify the pricing structure to simplify the decision process for customers
                Or
                After price levels t o match customer expectations

                Image Enhancement: After pricing policies to reflect the increased emphasis on the product's quality image.

* Although profits are an important consideration in pricing all goods and services, they are critical when the product is assumed to be a fad. Fad products can expect a rather short market life, making a profit objective essential to allow the firm to recover its investment in a short period of time. In such cases, the firm must harvest profits before customers lose interest and move on to the next electronic pet, troll doll, or cartoon idol.

#### Sales or Market Share Objectives
* A sales or market share objective involves setting prices at a level that will maximize sales, in either dollar or units, or will attain a desired level of sales or market share. Does setting a price to increase unit sales or market share (sales objectives) simply mean pricing the product lower than the competition? Sometimes this is the case. The telephone industry provides a good example: Suppliers such as Telus, Sprint, and AT&T constantly make rate adjustments to keep them ahead in the "telephone wars". Lowering prices is not always necessary to increase market share. If a company's product has a nimportant competitive advantage over competitors' offerings, keeping the price at the same level as other firms do may satisfy sales objectives.

#### Competitive Effect Objectives
* A pricing plan with a competitive effect objective is intended to have a certain effect on the marketing efforts of the competition. Sometimes a firm deliberately seeks to pre-empt or reduce the effectiveness of one or more competitors. Recently, Toys "R" Us sought to cut into the Christmas toy sales of Walmart. It launched an early-November program offering nearly $500 worth of price-off coupons. The move gave Wal-mart too little time to react. This "Christmas surprise" enabled Toy "R" us to generate a significant portion of its holiday-time sales from one single price-off coupon program. Price stability is another competitive effect objective. Retail gasoline companies like Shell, Esso, and Petro-Canada want to avoid price wars and closely match competitor pricing.

#### Customer Satisfaction Objectives
* Many customer-oriented firms believe that profits result from making customer satisfaction the primary objective. Firms that have customer satisfaction (and retention) objectives set prices to maximize the value to the customer, believing that by focusing solely on short term profits, a commpany loses sight of keeping customers for the long term. Travelocity.com, one of the leading online travel providers, is one company that focuses on customer satisfaction. The "Travelocity Service Guarantee" is a promise to stand behind customers and support them always, even when they are on the road. If something goes wrong with travel arrangements made through Travelocity, it will do everything in its power to make things right by working with its brand partners on behalf of the customer.

#### Image Enhancing (Positioning) Objectives
* Organizations that make pricing decisions based on image enhancement (or positioning) objectives recognize that consumers often use price to make inferences about the quality of a product. In fact, marketers know that price is often an important means of communicating not only quality but also image to prospective customers.
* The image enhancement function of pricing is particularly important for prestige or luxury products like diamonds. While the high price tag on a Rolex watch or a Rolls-Royce car reflects the higher production costs, it is also vital to shaping an image of an extraordinary product with ownership limited to wealthy consumers. The Burton Snowboard Company, like many other boarding companies, sets high prices on its products to communicate an elite image and uniqueness in the boarding subculture.
* Another example of image pricing comes from Calgary-based Nevada Bob's Golf Inc., the world's largest chain of golf specialty retail stores. Backed by cross Canada market research, it has begun moving its image upmarket--starting by taking "discount" out of the store brand name (it was "nevada Bob's Discount Golf"). it now offers a broarder and more upscale range of golf products, a more comfortable, customer friendly storefront, and improved customer service, while still offering a best-price guarantee.
* A low price is just as important as communicating a different image. Zellers uses price to position the company as a value leader with its slogan "The lowest price is the law". In other cases, such as for Timex watches, the desire is to communicate the image of a good-quality product that is reasonably priced.

#### Flexibility of Price Objectives
* It is important that pricing objectives be flexible. Often, it is necessary to develop pricing objectives (and strategies) tailored to different geographic areas and time periods. There may be varying levels of competition in different parts of the country, making it necessary to lower prices in the area with the heaviest competition. Some geographic region may have greater sales potential, making it wise for firms to develop pricing objectives aimed at obtaining a larger market share in those areas. Mortgage leaders may do this by offering lower rates in areas where new housing starts are booming.
* Market conditions can change during the year, requiring price adjustments for seasonal and other reasons. Accommodation rental rates in Whistler, British Columbia, are much higher during the winter than during the summer; rates in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, or Grand Bend, Ontario, are higher during the summer vacation months.
* Pricing objectives are only one part of price planning. Before any prices can be set, marketers must understand the alternative pricing strategies available t o achieve those objectives.

## PRICING STRATEGIES/POLICIES
* An old Russian proverb says: "There are two kinds of fools in any market. One doesn't charge enough. The other charges too much". This underscores the strategic decision behind pricing--how much value to offer the customer versus how much value to retain in terms of profit for t he firm. Today's marketers may ponder the message. In modern busienss there is seldom a one-and-only, now-and-forever, best pricing strategy; pricing today has more of the continuous decision-making character of a chess game. The organization must think two or three moves ahead. And no pricing decision is set in stone. Costs increase. Sales decline. The competition changes in prices. Price reduction can discourage new competitors or at least sabotage competitors' product introductions. Toyota is using strategic pricing to increase its market share of the lucrative pcikup truck market--once dominated by the big-three North American manufacturers. Features such as side curtain air bags and traction control are standard in teh Toyota Tundra--options that GM and Ford charge customers extra for. The option-loaded Toyata Tundra is priced comparably to the base price for other North American trucks. The strategy allows Toyota to appear not be massively undercutting prices in the market--while at the same time being priced very commpetitively when consumers compare similar equipped truck.
* Marketers whose responsibility it is to develop pricing strategies will consider a number of alternative strategies and try to anticipate the outcomes. Below we discuss some of the more common pricing strategies associated with each price objective--these are summarized in figure below. You will notice in some cases that the same strategy can be used to achieve different objectives.

### Pricing Strategies to Achieve Profit Objectives
* There are many pricing strategy consistent with profit-oriented price objectives. The three main sets of strategies are based on cost, demand, and experience.
* **COST-BASED PRICING STRATEGIES** Cost-based strategies are typically associated with a target profit or return objectives. By understanding a product's cost structure, marketers can set prices to achieve a desire profit. Marketers use cost-based strategies because they are simply to calculate and are relatively safe, in that they ensure that the price will cover the costs the company incurs in producing and marketing the product.
* Cost-based pricing methods, however, have drawbacks. They do not consider such factors as the nature of the target market, demand, competition, the product life cycle, and the product's image. In addition, although the calculations for setting the price may be simple and straightforward, it may be difficult to estimate costs accurately. Think about such firms as Nortel, Bombardier, and McCain, which produce many products. how do they allocate the ocsts for the plant, equipment, design engineers, maintenance, and marketing personnel so that the pricing plan accurately reflects the cost of production for any particular product? For example, how do you allocate the salary of a marketing executive who deals with many different products? Should the cost be divided equally among all products? Should costs be based on the actual number of hours spent working on each product? Or should costs be assigned based on the revenues generated by each product? There is no one right answer. However, even with these limitatinos, cost-based pricing strategies are often a marketer's best choice.
* **Cost-Plus Pricing** The most common cost-based approach to pricing a product is cost-plus pricing, **in which a marketer totals the unit costs for the product and then adds an amount to cover desired profit.** Many marketers especially retailers and wholesaler, use cost-plus pricing because of its simplicity--users need only estimate the unit cost and add the markup. To calculate cost-plus pricing, marketers usually calculate either a markup on cost or a markup on selling price. With both methods, you calculate the price by adding a predetermined percentage to the cost, but as t he names of the methods imply, for one the calculation uses a percentage of the costs and for the other a percentage of the selling price. Which of the two methods is used seems often to be little more than a matter of "the way our company has always done it". 
* **Price-Floor Pricing** These cost-based pricing methods do not take into account any factors except costs and profits. But there are times where firms need to consider other factors, such as the advantage of having a plant operating at its peak capacity, which keeps a skilled workforce fully employed. Price-floor pricing is a method for calculating price that considers both costs and what can be done to ensure that a plant can operate at its capacity.
* Price-floor pricing is sometimes used when the state of the economy or other temporary market conditions make it **impossible for a firm to sell enough units of its product at a price that covers fixed costs (those that do not change with the number of units produced), variable costs (the additional cost to make one more unit of a product), and profit goals to keep its plants operating at full capacity.** **In such circumstances, it may be possible to sell part of the units produced at a lower price, one that covers only the variable costs of production. If the price-floor price can be set above the marginal costs, then the firm can use the difference to increase profits or to help cover its fixed costs.**
* For example, assume that a jeans firm, operating at full capacity, can produce 400,000 pairs of jeans a year. The average variable costs per unit are $20; the price that covers fixed costs, variable costs and a desire level of profit is a $30 per pair. Due to a downturn in the economy, the firm finds that it can sell only 350,000 units at this price. Using price floor pricing, the firm can sell the additional 50,000 pairs of jeans at a price as low as $20 and maintain full capacity operations
* If it adopts this approach, the firm will not make anything on the additional units, but it will not lose anything either. if it sells the additional 50,000 pairs at $25, then it will not only cover the variable costs but will also increase its total profits--50,000*$5 or $250,000--not a bad deal. But sebveral risks accompany price-floor pricing. Selling the additional 50,000 pairs of jeans at a lower cost might cannibalize full-price sales, and if the lower price is offered to some retailers and not others, it might anger those not included and undermind customer loyalty.
* Firms that produce their own national brands as well as manufacture private-label brands sold through various retailers and distributors may use price-floor pricing for the private label end of the business. Thus , Frigidaire may sell 70 percent of its refrigerators under the Frigidaire name and the rest to Sears for sale under its own Kenmore brand name.
* Cost-based strategies are quite popular because they ensure that prices take into account an organization's costs. However, when firms base price strategies on cost, they are operating under the old production orientation and not a marketing orientation.
* **DEMAND-BASED PRICING** Demand-based pricing is basing the selling price on an estimate of volume or quantity that a fir mcan sell at different prices. To use any of the pricing strategy based on demand, firms must research demand--they must learn what quantities of a product different target markets are willing to buy at different prices. Used pickup trucks in Alberta, for example, are in greater demand than in British Columbia, causing prices to be significantly higher in Alberta.
* Often marketers use customer surveys in which consumers reveal whether they would buy a certain product and how much of it they would buy at various prices. More accurate estimates can be obtained by some type of field experiment. For instance, a firm might actualyl offer the product at different price levels in different test markets and map the results onto a demand curve.
* The demand curve, which can be curved or straight line, shows the quanity of a product that customers will buy in a market during a period of time at various prices if all other factors remain the same. For most goods, the mand curve slops downward and to the right. If prices, decrease, customers will buy more. This is known as the law of demand. For example, if the price of bananas in the grocery store goes up, a customer will probably buy fewer of them. If the price increases too much, the customer will eat his or her cereal without bananas.
* There are situations, however, in which otherwise rational people desire a product more as it increases in price. For prestige products, such as luxury cars or jewellery or even some business diplomas and degrees, an increase in price may actually result in an increase in the quantity demanded, because consumers see the products as more valuable. The higher price-higher-demand relationship has its limits, however. At some point price increases will make the product unattainable, and demand will begin to decrease, as shown by the backward  direction taken by the top portion of the backward-bending curve under Prestige Products.
* A strength of demand-based pricing strategies is that their use assures a firm that it will be able to sell what it produces at the determined price, because the price is based on research findings about customer demand rather than on the seller's costs. A major disadvantage is the difficulty of estimating demand accurately. Although sales forecasting is a topic covered in advanced marketing courses, it is important to know that estimating demand can be difficult. This is because the size of markets is often not known and needs to be estimated, the market share a firm might expect to capture needs to be estimated, and these projections need to take into consideration other factors that can affect demand, such as new competitors entering the market, the state of the ecnonomy, and chaniging consumer tastes. Dell is one company that uses demand pricing. Dell revises the price of its computer when necessary to offset decreasing sales. The company reviews its prices frequently (often a few times a month) in an attempt to keep tabs on customer thinking and give customers the value they want. 
* For specific demand-based pricing strategies are **target cost pricing, yield management pricing, variable (custom) pricing, and skimming pricing**
* **Target Cost Pricing** Today firms are finding that they can be more successful if they match price with demand using a process called target costing. **With target costing, a firm first determines the price at which customers would be willing to buy the product and then it works backward to design the product in such a way that it can produce and sell the product at a profit.** With target costing, **a product's cost, and thus its price, is strongly tied to its design--70% to 80% of a product's costs are determined by its final design**
* With target costing ,firms first use marketing research to identify the quality and functionality needed to satisfy attractive market segments and what price they are willing to pay before the rpoduct is designed. As  table below shows, the next step is to determine what margins retailers and dealers require, as well as the rpofit margin the company requires. Based on this information, managers ca ncalculate the target cost--the maximum it can cost the firm to manufacture the product. In addition, the commpany may break down this total target cost into different product functions or components, allocating more of the cost to product features consumers consider critical. If the firm can meet customer quality and functionality requirements, and control costs to meet the required price, it will manufacture the product. If not, it abandons the product.

                Step 1: Determine the price customers are willing to pay for the jeans. $39.99
                Step 2: Determine the markup required by the retailer. 40%=0.4
                Step 3: Calculate the maximum price the reatiler will pay, the markup amount
                        Price to the Retailer=selling price*(1-markup percentage)
                        =39.99*0.6=$23.99
                Step 4: Determine the profit required by the firm. 15%=0.15
                Step 5: calculate the target cost, the maximum cost of producing the jeans
                        Target Cost=Price to the Retailer * (1-profit percentage)=$23.99*0.85=$20.39

* Camera marker Olympus Optical Company has adopted target costing. When Olympus began losing money in the mid 1980s, it first tried to introduce new products. A second initiative was to improve product quality. Its third initiative was to examine production costs. Olympus managers realized that success depended on their ability to manufacture products at a cost that would meet customers' requirements. Olympus determined that a baseline price for a compact camera in the Canadian market was $140. Considering import fees and the margins dealers required, Olympus determined a target cost for any new product. Initially onyl about 20 percent of proposed new models would meet the target costs on the first pass. But those that did quickly became the most popular--and profitable--compact camera in the Canadian market.
* **Yield-Management Pricing**: Yield-management pricing is another type of demand-based pricing strategy most commonly used by airlines, hotels, and cruise lines. With yield-management pricing, firms charge different prices to different customers to manage capacity while maximizing revenues. Many service firms practise yield-management pricing because they recognize that different customers have different sensitivities to price--some customers will pay top dollar for an airline ticket while others will travel only if there is a discount fare. The goal of yield-management pricing is to accurately predict the proportion of customers who fall into each category and allocate the percentages of the airline's or hotel's capacity accordingly so that no product goes unsold.
* For example, an airline may have two prices for seats: the full fare ($899) and the discount fare ($299). The airline must predict how many seats it can fill at full fare and how many can be sold at only the discounted fare. The airline begins months ahead of the date of the flight with a basic allocation of seats--perhaps it will place 25 percent in the full fare "bucket" and 75 percent in the discount fare "bucket". While the seats in the full fare bucket can not be sold at the discounted price, the seats allocated for the discounted price can be sold at the full fare.
* As flight time gets closer, the airline might make a series of adjustments to the allocation of seats in the hope of selling every seat on the plane at the highest price possible. If the Toronto Maple Leafs need to book the flight, chances are some of the discount seats will be sold at full fare, decreasing the number available at the discounted price. If, as the flight date nears, the number of full-fare ticket sales falls below the forecast, some of those seats will be moved to the discount bucket. This process continues until the day of the flight as the airline attempts to have every seat filled when the plane takes off. This is why you may be able to get a fantastic price on an airline ticket through discount travel agencies like Skyaution.com or Cheapticketscanada.com if you wait until the last minute to buy your ticket.
* This strategy is similar to a price discrimination strategy where different segments are targeted for different pricing levels--such as the price difference between men's and women's haircuts and men's and women's dry-cleaning. 
* **Variable Pricing**: Variable pricing, or custom pricing, is a strategy of **tailoring the price of a product to reflect variability in market demand and what different customers are willing to pay**. The price of gasoline, for example, is often set higher during periods of peak demand--like long weekends. **Variable pricing is common in business-to-business marketing contexts where prices are typically negotiated in new buy or modified re-buy situations like the digital imaging system purchase** described in the Venture 4th case at the end of Chapter 6, on submitted as sealed bids (typical of government purchases). Coca-Cola has been experimenting with the concept of variable pricing in vending machines--with the price determined by the ambient temperature outside the machine--and a rationale that consumers may be willing to pay more for a cold Coke when it is hot outside. **Variable pricing could be considered a profit-oriented strategy as it ensures that products are sold at the highest price each customer is willing to pay.** However, it could also be considered a custommer satisfaction-based strategy as it also ensures that customers get the best "deal" they are able to negotiate.
* **Skimming Pricing** Skimming means taking the top or best part of something--like the crean that separates and rises to the top of non-homogenized milk, used for making ice crean and whipped cream. In pricing new products, one strategy is to set a skimming price, which means that the firm charges a high, premium price for its new product, expecting demand from the top spending, least price sensitive, target market. For example, when Top-Flite introduced its new Strata golf balls with a new dimple design and more solid core for better flight with metal clubs, the price was three times that of regular balls. Pro shops still couldn't keep them in stock.
* **If a product is highly desirable and offers unique benefits, and early adopters are not price-sensitive during the introductory stage of the product life cycle, a skimming pricing strategy allows a firm to quickly recover research, development, and promotion costs, resulting in earilier profitability than under other pricing strategy.** *For skimming pricing to be successful, however, there should be little chance that competitors can get into the market quickly*. With high complex, technical products, it may be quite a while before competitors can develop and test new products and get them into production. This is the case for patented pharmaceutical products that have a lock on the market for 25 years.
* A skimming pricing strategy is most successful when the market consists of several customer segments with different levels of price sensitivity. There must be a substantial number of initial product customers who have very low price sensitivity. After a period of time, the price can go down, and a second segment of the market with a slightly higher level of price sensitivity will purchase, and so on. For example, hand calculators that once commanded $200 can now be bought for less than $2--accessible to almost everyone.
* Experience-based pricing strategies: SKIM

#### Market Share Pricing Strategies
* While variable pricing can result in maximized profit and satisfied customers, the negotiation process can be time consuming, and consumers have different levels of negotiating skills. This leaves some customers with cognitive dissonance, wondering if they got the best price.
* **VALUE PRICING** To address this issue, car manufacturers like Saturn, and retailers such as Zellers and Walmart, practice **value pricing, or everyday low pricing (EDLP)**, which promises ultimate value to consumers--without having to negotiate or bargin for it. As discussed in Chapter 1, customer value is the benefits received by a customer relative to the costs and sacrifices necessary to obtain those benefits. This means that, in the cusotmers' eyes, the product's price is justfied by what they receive.
* Value-based pricing begins with customers, then considers the competition, and then determines the best pricing strategy. Smart marketers know that the firm that wins is not necessarily the one with the lowest prices but rather the one that delivers the most value.
* This has been the strategy behind the success of Westjet Airlines. Modelled after Southwest Airlines, Westjet focuses on everyday low fares, short distances, and good customer service to attract budget-conscious leisure travellers throughout Canada. it started with understanding the target market--what it would take to get people out of their cars for short-haul trips--then the company made marketing mix decisions to deliver the value bundle sought by those customers: no-frills, direct flights, at rock-bottom prices, to and from under-utilized airports, using standard aircraft, serviced by personable staff, offering fun and lighthearted customer interactions.
* In practice, when marketers use EDLP strategies, consumers feel they get more for their money. Marketers hope that will make them see the price as reasonable and encourage them to remain loyal rather than snapping up whatever happens to be on sale. Deal-oriented consumers, however, have been conditioned to choose products because they are "on special" rather than because they are superior to others. The problem with "deals" or frequent price promotions is that consumers learn to wait for sales or stock up on products when they are on sale, thus making it difficult for companies to maintain "regular" margins and production volumes. **Procter& Gamble tries to establish an EDLP strategy in teh early 1990s for such products as Tide and Pampers, but abandoned this strategy in the face of competitors continuing to offer sales, coupons, and other price promotions.**
* **FREQUENT DISCOUNTING** The approach of using sales, coupons, and other discounts to stimulate sales is a frequent discounting strategy. Retailers like Future Shop that have weekly sale extravaganzas use this strategy to entice consumers into their stores where they may purchase both sale and non-sale items. **The problem with frequent discounting is that it conditions consumers to wait for the sale price. if they can wait, consumers will not pay the "regular" price for a two-litre bottle of Coca-cola, knowing that it goes on sale for 99 cents periodically and is in the $1.79 range regularly.
* **PENETRATION PRICING** Another market share-based strategy is penetration pricing. Penetration pricing, the opposite of skimming pricing, is when a new product is introduced at a very low price, as Intel did with its first Pentium porcessor chip. **Because rivals were way behind in developing competitive chips, Intel had used a skimming strategy for the 486 processor. However, when the Pentium 1 was introduced, Intel knew that Motorola was working with IBM and Apple to develop comparable chips, and it set a low price for the Pentium 1 to sell more in a short period of time and derail Motorola debut.** This strategy worked well for Intel. The low price encouraged demand and sales in the early stage of the product life cycle. if the marketing objective is to beef up market share, penetration pricing makes sense.
* Another reason marketers use penetration pricing is to discourage competitors from entering the market. The firm first out with a new product has an important advantage. Experience has shown that pioneering brand often is able to maintain dominant market share for the life of the product. Competitors looking at the market may feel that the potential for developing a profitable alternative is not good. Bayer aspirin and Hoover vacuum cleaners are examples of brands that were first to market, kept their leads for decades, and still dominate their fields. These pioneering brands don't need to do much talking to tell consumers who they are. keeping prices low may even act as a barrier to potential competitors, because the cost of developing and manufacturing a new similar product prevents a satisfactory return.
* **TRIAL PRICING**: With trial pricing, a new product carries a low price for a limited period of time to lower the risk for a customer, then the price is increased to "regular" levels. In trial pricing, the idea is to win customer acceptance first and make profit later. A low enough introductory price may be a preferred alternative to giving out free samples, as the trial price will bring some positive contribution to the organization. Via Rail recently launched its "miss Mom's Cooking Campaign" targeting university students. The campaign is based on the assumption that many first-year students are missing Mom's home cooking and clean laundry. Ads feature empty fridges and piles of dirty laundry. Flyers were distributed to university residence encouraging students to visit a special website where they would receive a special reduced fare on a train ticket "home to Mom". According to Via Rail executives, the objectives of this reduced fare was to encourage trial, so that later on when students start their careers they would be aware of Via Rail.
* In another example, Telus is conducting a $65 million experiment to bring digital TV, movies on demand, Internet, email, and phone service into homes for one monthly bill. After the trial offer, Telus will decide how widely the services will be offered and whether there is an opportunity to increase prices. Trial pricing also works for services. Health clubs and other service providers frequently offer trial memberships or special introductory prices. They hope that customers will try the service at a low price and be converted to a regular-price customer.

#### Competitive Effect Pricing Strategy
* Competitive-effect pricing strategies are those that are competitor focused. To achieve competitive effect objectives, a firm can adopt a price-leader-follower strategy, a premium pricing strategy, an umbrella pricing strategy, or a price bundling strategy.
* **PRICE LEADERSHIP (FOLLOWER)** Before Walmart came to Canada, Zellers was clearly the price leader in discount stores. Other discount stores would price their products similarly to Zellers. A firm that chooses a price leadership strategy is either the industry leader or it follows the industry leader by setting the same or similar prices. **Usually, firms practise a price leadership strategy when they're in an oligopoly with relatively few producers--such as the Canadian petroleum industry or cellphone industry. In such an industry, it is in the best interest of all firms to minimize price competition for everyone to make a profit.** Price leadership strategies are popular, because they provide an acceptable and legal way for firms to agree on prices without ever talking with each other.
* Even when there isn't a single industry price leader, firms may adopt a parity pricing strategy--they try to keep their price about equal to key competitors' prices. Gasoline retailers attempt to maintain a parity pricing structure by responding quickly to competitive price movesl consumers often view this rapid response as price fixing. Numerous national and provincial investigation of gasoline prices have found no evidence of price fixing, and the petroleum companies are spending millions of dollars educating consumers about the cost structure of gasoline.
* **PREMIUM PRICING** Sometimes firms choose to price their products higher than competitive offerings. While this strategy helps to portray a premium or quality positioning, it also helps firms achieve the competitive effect of market leadership and price stability. IBM computers, for example, are priced 10 percent to 15 percent higher than competitive offering, in part because IBM's industry leadership allow them to, and it protects the pricing in t he industry and enables competitors to compete on price without entering a price war. For similar reasons, Microsoft computer peripherals, such as optical mice, are priced 10 percent to 20 percent higher than competitive products. Coca-Cola is counting on its market leadership position, brand equity, and customer loyalty to support a new premium pricing strategy, pricing Coke products above the commpetition in an attempt to increase margins and profits.
* Umbrella Pricing: [summary] price below the competition
* Price Bundling: selling two or more goods or services as a single package for one price

#### Pricing Strategies to Achieve Customer Satisfaction Objectives
* When firms develop pricing strategies that cater the needs of customers, they are less concerned with short-term successes than with keeping customers for the long term. Firms truly dedicated to customer satisfaction look at the wants and needs of customers in developing pricing strategies. **Three pricing strategies we have already discussed can be used to achieve customer satisfaction objectives: variable pricing, value pricing, and price bundling.** Another strategy to achieve customer satisfaction objectives is to consider total cost of ownership. The cost of ownership is the price consumers pay for a product, plus the cost of maintaining and using the product, less its resale (or salvage) value.

#### Pricing Strategy to Achieve Image Enhancement / Positioning Objectives
* There are three common pricing strategies for achieving image enhancement (positioning) objectives. We have already discussed value pricing (everyday lwo pricing), which is used to support a value of increasing market share. **We have also already discussed premium pricing as a competitive-effect based strategy, but premium pricing could also be used to support a premium positioning strategy where higher-than-competition pricing is intended to support inferences of higher quality or another basis of superiority.** Related to premium pricing is prestige pricing, which is pricing products significatnly highly than commpetitive brands to make them status symbols. 

### PRICE POINTS AND TACTICS
* Once marketers have developed pricing strategies, the next step in price planning is to actually set prices by applying pricing tactics and to set t he terms and conditions associated with that price. **In practice, prices are set in the ragne determined by the product's costs, what customers are willing to pay, and the price of competitive or substitute products.** However, as seen in figure below, there are a number of considerations for setting prices within the range.

#### Pricing for Individual Products
* How marketers present a product's price to the market can make a big difference in the attractiveness of the offering. here are two tactics:
* With *two-part* pricing, two separate types of payments are required to purchase the product. For example, golf and tennis club charge yearly or monthly fee plus fees for each round of golf or tennis. Cellular minutes usage for a monthly fee plus a per-minute rate for extra usage.
* *Payment pricing* makes products appear more attainable by breaking up the total price into smaller amounts payable over time. For example, many customers now opt to lease rather than buy a car. The monthly lease amount is an example of payment pricing, which tends to make people less sensitive to the total price of the car.

Marketing Concepts: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. Government sometimes provide price subsidies to specific industries; that is, they reduce a demestic firm's costs so that they can sell products on the international market at a lower price. What reasons do governments (and politicians) use for these government subsidies? What are the benefits and disadvantages to domestic industries in t he long run? How about to international customers? Who would benefit to lose if all price subsidies were eliminated?
2. Critics of business often accuse marketers of taking advantages of consumers by setting prices that are far above the cost of producing the good and service--sometimes 10 or 20 or more times the cost. How do you feel about this? What reasons might a manufacturer of luxury product have for setting very high prices? Why might a pharmaceutical firm set the rpices of its life-saving medicines higher than the cost of production requires?
3. With a price leadership strategy, firm can avoid price competition and yet not be guilty of illegal collusion--getting together to set prices. Although it is legal, is a price leadership strategy ethical? how does a price leadership strategy hurt and how does it help the industry? What benefits does it provide and what problems does it pose for customers?
4. Everyday low pricing strategy have met with limited success. What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of EDLP? Are some products more suited to it than others? Why have customers not been more responsive to EDLP? What do you think its future will be?
5. Two-part pricing and payment pricing are pricing tactics that are designed to make price more palatable to customers and to better meet their needs. But do these policies always benefit consumers? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these pricing approaches for hte average consuemr? For business customers?
6. Technology is said to be creating a pricing revolution. How is electronic commerce changing pricing strategies? In what ways are such changes good for customers? In what ways are the change good for sellers?
7. In pricing new products, marketers may choose a skimming or a penetration pricing strategy. While it's easy to see the benefits of these practices for the firm, what is the advantage or disadvnatage of the practice for consumers? For the inudstry as a whole?

Marketing Practice: Applying What You've Learned
1. Assume that you are the director of marketing for a large Rocky Mountain ski resort. It is essential that the resort maintain a high occupancy rate during the skiing season. Pricing is an important part of your marketing strategy, because the demand for rooms at your resort is very price elastic. For this reason, you feel that you should develop contingency pricng plans for use during changes in the economic environment (inflation and recessions, for example). List the economic conditions that might warrant changes in the pricing strategy, and gave your recommendatinos for each possibility.
2. Assume that you are the assistant director of marketing for a firm that manufactures a line of hair-care product (e.g., shampoos, conditioners). This morning, your boss came into your office and announced that she is going to recommend a dramatic price increase. You respond by saying: "Well, I guess that means we need to totally revamp our marketing plan." To this, she relies, "No, all we're going to do is raise the price. We're not going to mess with anything else". After she leave you think, "I've got to convince her that we can't make pricing decisions without considering the other elements of the marketing mix. It's all interrelated."
* In a role-playing situation with one of your classmates, explain to your boss why you think the marketing department should consider the implications of the price increase on the other marketing mix elements, what you feel these implications are, and what recommendations for change might be suggested.
3. As the vice-president for marketing in a firm that markets computer software, you must regularly develop pricing strategies for new software products. Your latest product is a software package that automatically translates any foreign-language email messages into the user's preferred language. You are trying to decide on the pricing for this new product. Should you use a skimming price, a penetration price, or something in between? With a classmate taking the role of another marketing professional with your firm, argue in front of your class the pros and cons of each alternative.
4. Assume that you are working in the marketing department of a firm that manufactures furnaces and air conditioners. Previously, your fim has limited its operations to manufacturing units for other OEM companies. Now your firm is expanding, you will be manufacturing your product for sale with your own brand name and will be selling to heating and air-conditioning distributors across the country. What pricing objectives, strategies, and tactics will you adopt?
5. Assume that you and your friend have decided to go into business together manufacturing wrought-iron birdcages. You know that your fixed costs (rent on a building, equipment, for example) will be $60,000 a year. You expect your variable costs to be $12 per birdcage.

                a. If you plan on selling the birdcages to retail stores for $18, how many must you sell to break even?
                b. Assume that you and your partner feel that you must set a goal of achieving $10,000 profit with your business this year. How many units would you have to sell to make that amount of profit?
                c. What if you feel that you will be able to sell no more than 5000 birdcages? What price will you have to charge to break even? To make $10,000 in profit?

Marketing Mini-Project: Learning by Doing
* Organizations develop pricing strategies to meet pricing objectives. These objectives may be related to sales, profit, the competition, customer satisfaction, or the image of the product. The purpose of this mini-project is to help you understand how different pricing objectives are important in marketing planning.
* Many universities are having trouble filling up their existing dormitory space, as more and more students choose to live off campus in houses or in apartments. Identify your university's existing pricing objectives and develop recommendations for changes.
1. First, with two or three of your classmates, interview someone who participates in your university's pricing of dormitory space. It may be the vice-president for student affiars, the dean of students, the director of student life, or the vice-president for business and finance. Try to find out:

                a. The current prices charged for dormitory space
                b. What the pricing objectives for dormitory space are
                c. How the prices are calculated
                d. The part that costs, demand, customer satisfaction, and competitive housing prices play in setting the dorm prices.
2. Next,talk with students in your school to find out:

                a. Students' attitudes toward the prices charged for dormitory space
                b. What a customer-pleasing price would be for dormitory space
                c. The type and price of alternative housing used by students
                d. Any other relevant student attitudes toward dormitory housing
        
3. Develop a report that includes your findings and the recommendations you would make to your university. Be sure to focus on the pricing objectives currently in use and the alternative objectives that might be considered. What pricing strategies do your findings suggest? Present your results to your class.


# CHAPTER 10: Channels and Supply Chain Strategy

## CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION: THE FINAL FRONTIER
* Channels of distribution may be the final "frontier" for competitive success. After years of hype, many consumers no longer believe that "new and improved" products really are new and improved. **Competitors usually easily match aggressive pricing strategies. Advertising and other forms of marketing communications are so commonplace that they have lost much of their impact. Marketers know that channels of distribution may be the only one of the four Ps for which there is an opportunity for sustainable competitive advantage.** With companies like Walmart that masterfully use the power of channel distribution, marketing is now going back to its roots. In fact, **when the study of marketing was first initiated at the turn of the twentieth century, it was first and foremost the study of the channels area. Moreover, marketing was then known as distribution**
* Book retailers are well aware of the major criteria people use to choose a bookstore selection, availability, pricing, and knowledgeable staff. **Because the convenience of buying a book is important to customers, book retailers such as Chapters and Indigo try to make channels of distribution a competitive advantage.** **By channels, we mean making goods and services available where and when customers need and want them.** Banks and trust companies, for example, make it easy for people to access their services by locating instant tellers where people are likely to need money; at malls, grocery stores, and airport lounges. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, for example, teamed up with Loblaw Companies Limited to offer "President's Choice Financial", an in-store no-fee banking service with low mortgage rates and no-minimum-balance saving accounts paying interest above CIBC's own products. **The other major banks also have kiosks in supermarkets--this makes good sense since as many as 10,000 to 30,000 shoppers pass by each week.**
* For those who don't even have time to run out to the grocery store, the Internet is fast becoming an important place for consumers to shop for everything from tulip bulbs, Montreal smoked meat, and mortgage to exotic vacations. Chapters.indigo.ca and Amazon.com among others, make books available to consumers any time and any place. Expedia offers vacation packages directly to consumers. it does so by being a wholesaler between vacation package suppliers (such as Sunquest, Transat Holiday, and Air Canada Vacations) and consumers. **The Internet enables even small firms with limited resources to enjoy the same competitive advantages as their largest competitors in terms of *making their products available to customers around the globe.***
* This chapter is about the science and art of distributing goods and services to customers. First, we'll discuss distribution channels and how marketers make smart decisions in developing distribution strategies. We'll also talk about supply chains and the importance of supply chain strategy for business success.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTRIBUTION: YOU CAN'T SELL WHAT ISN'T THREE
* You have identified and profiled your target market(s). You have created your product and priced it. You're not done. You need to get it to your customer. **In today's marketplace, marketers must work hard to get their products to consumers, who no longer have the leisure time to "shop till they drop" for goods and services**. You also want to structure your channel(s) so that it can adapt rapidly to competitive changes. For example, the Internet forced many companies to change their distribution model.

### What Is a Distribution Channel?
* **A channel of distribution is a series of firms or individuals that faciliates the movement of a product from the producer to the final customer.** **In many cases, channels include an organized network of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers that develop relationships and work together to make products conveniently available to buyers.**
* Distribution channels come in different shapes and sizes. The bakery around the corner where you buy your cinnamon rolls is a member of channel, as is the baked goods section at the local supermarket, the espresso bar at the mall that sells biscotti to go with your double mocha cappuccino, and the bakery outlet store that sells day-old rolls at a discount.
* **A channel of distribution consists of, at a minimum, a producer--the individual or firm that manufactures or produces a good or service--and a customer.** This is a direct channel. **For example, when you buy a kilogram of strawberries at a farm where they're grown, that's a direct channel. Firms that sell their own products through catalogues, 800 numbers, the Internet, or factory outlet stores use direct channels.**
* But channels often are indirect, because they include one or more channel intermediaries, firms or individuals such as wholesalers, agents, brokers, and retailers that in some way help move the product to the consumer or business user. For example, strawberry farmers may choose to sell their berries to a produce wholesaler that, in turn, sells cases of the berries to supermarkets and restaurants that, in turn, sell to consumers.

### Channel Objectives
* The first step in deciding on a distribution plan is to develop appropriate objectives that support the organization's overall marketing goals. How can distribution work with the other elements of the marketing mix to increase profit. To increase market share? To increase volume of sales?
* In general, **the overall objective of any distribution planning is to make a firm's product available when, where, and in the quantities customers want and need at a minimum cost**. **More specific distribution objectives, however, depend on characteristics of the product and the market. For example, if the product is bulky, a primary distribution objective may be to minimize shipping costs. If the product is fragile, a goal may be to develop a channel that minimizes handling.** **In introducing a new product to a mass market, a channel objective may be to provide maximum product exposure or to make the product available close to where customers live and work. Sometimes marketers make their product available where similar products are sold so that consumers can compare prices.**

### Evaluating the Environment
* After setting the distribution objectives, marketers must consider their internal and external environments. **The organization must examine such issues as its own ability to create distribution channels, what channel intermediaries are available, the ability of customers to access these intermediaries, and how the competition distributes its products. Should a firm use the same retailers as its competitors? Sometimes, to ensure customers' undivided attention, a firm sells its products in outlets that don't carry the competitors' products.** In other cases, a firm uses the same intermediaries as its competitors because customers expect to find the product there. Finally, by studying competitors' distribution strategies, marketers can learn from their success and failures. **For example, if the biggest complaint of competitors' customers is delivery speed, developing a system that allows same-day delivery can make the competition pale in commparison.**

### Choosing a Distribution System
* Planning distribution strategies means making at least three decisions. Distribution planning includes decisions about the number of levels in the distribution channel, but distribution strategies also involve decisions about channel relationships--whether a conventional system or a highly integrated system will work best. A final decision relates to the distribution intensity or the number of intermediaries at each level of the channel.
* **CONVENTIONAL, VERTICAL, AND HORIZONTAL MARKETING SYSTEMS** Participants in any distribution channel form an interrelated system. To develop a successful distribution strategy, marketers must consider the different types of systems and select the one that best meet their needs. In general, these system take one or three forms: conventional, vertical, and horizontal marketing systems.
* a **conventional marketing system** is a multiple-level distribution channel in which members work independently of one another. Their relationships are limited to simply buying and selling from one another. Each firm seeks to benefit with little concern for other channel members. Even though channel members work independently, most conventional channels are highly successful. For one thing, all members of the channel are working for the same goals--to build demand, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. And the channel members know that it's everyone's best interest to treat other channel members fairly.
* A **vertical marketing system (VMS) is a channel in which there is cooperation among channel members at two or more levels of the channel--the manufacturing, wholesaling, and retailing levels. Firms in VMS work together and depend on each other, like links in a chain. Members share information and provide services to other members, recognizing that such coordination makes everyone more successful in reaching a desire target market.
* There are three types of vertical marketing systems: administered, corporate, and contractual. In an adminitered VMS, channel members remain independent but voluntarily agree to work together. In a corporate VMS, firms have ownership control of some or all of a distribution channel, such as when a manufacturer buys agent companies.
* In a contractual VMS, cooperation is enforced by contracts legal agreements that spell out each member's rights and responsibilities and how they will cooperate. In a wholesaler-sponsored VMS, wholesalers get retailers to work together under their leadership in a voluntary chain. retail members of the chain use a common name, cooperate in advertising and other promotion, and even develop their own private-label products. Examples of wholesaler-sponsored chains are IGA (Independent Grocer's Alliance) food stores. Ace Hardware stores, and Island Farms Dairy (BC).
* In other cases, retailers themselves organize a cooperative marketing channel system. A retailer cooperative is a group of retailers that has established a wholesaling operation to help them compete more effectively with the large chains. Each retailer owns shares in the wholesaler operation and is obligated to purchase a certain percentage of inventory from the cooperative operation. The Calary Co-op and True Value hardware Stores are example of retailer cooperatives.
* Franchise organizations are a third types of contractual VMS. In these organizations, channel cooperation is explicitly defined and strictly enforced through contractual arrangements in which a franchiser (a manufacturer or a service provider) allows an entrepreneur to use the franchise name and marketing plan for a fee. In most franchise agreements, the franchiser provides a variety of services for the franchisee, such as helping train employees, giving access to lower prices for needed materials, and helping pick a location with visibility. In return, the franchiser receives a percentage of revenue fromm the franchise owner. Usually the franchisees are also allowed to use the franchiser business format, but they are required to follow that format to the letter. For example, a McDonald's franchisee is not allowed to change the menu or the physical decor of teh restaurant. it's important that customers know that they can get the same Big Mac in Toronto that they will find in Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
* Canada is the franchise capital of the world. SKIP
* In a **horizontal marketing system**, two or more firms at the same channel level agree to work together to get their product to the customer. Air Canada and Lufthansa, for example, cooperate in providing passenger air service. To increase passenger volume for both airlines, they share a common flight code. This means that travel agents who book passengers on one of the airline's flights will be more likely to book a connecting flight on the other airline. To increase customer benefits, they also share frequent-flyer programs and airport clubs.

### Functions of Distribution Channels
* Distribution channel perform a number of different functions that make the flow of goods from the producer to the customer possible. These functions must be handled by someone, be it the producer, a channel intermediary, or even the customer. They can be shifted from one member of the channel to another, such as when customers pick up new chairs from the warehouse instead of having them delivered to their home, but they can not be eliminated.
* Channels provide form, time, place, information, and possession utility for customers. They make desired products available when, where, and in the sizes and quantities tht customers want them. **Utilities in marketing and distribution measure the ability of a good or service to satisfy a customer's needs or wants.** Economic utility can be divided into five types: form, time, place, information, and possession. First, the creation of form utility encompasses all activites used to change the appearance or commposition of a good or service with the intent of making it more attractive to potential and actual users. Secondly, time utility consists of the increased satisfaction created by marketing through making products available at the time consumers want them. Thirdly, place utility plays a siginficant role as well. it is the increased usefulness created by making a product available at a location preferred by consumers. Fourthly, information utility is defined as the value given to a product that provides the user with useful information. And finally, the increased usefulness created by making it possible for a consumer to own, use and consume a product is called possession utility, or sometimes ownership utlity.
* Take, for example, flowers. The flowers are harvested and electronically sorted by growers, auctioned to buyers in Amsterdam, shipped by air to importers in Mississauga, where they are inspected for insects and disease, transported to wholesalers around the country, and finally distributed to local florists who make them available to their customers. The channel members--the growers, the auction house, the importers, the wholesalers, and the local florists--all work together to create just the right bouquet for flower lovers.
* A second function of distribution channels is increasing the efficiency of the flow of goods from producer to customer. how would we buy groceries without our modern system of supermarkets? We'd have to get our milk from a dairy, our bread from a bakery, our tomatoes and corn from a local farmer, and our flour from a flour from a flourmill. And forget about specialty items, like Granola bars or Coca-Cola. **The compnaies that make these items would have to handle literally millions of transactions to sell to every individual who craved a junk-food fix.**
* Distribution channels create efficiencies by reducing the number of transactions necessary for goods to flow from many different manufacturers to large numbers of customers. This occurs in two ways. With bulk breaking, wholesalers and retailers purchase large quantities (usually cases) of goods from manufacturers but sell only one or a few at a time to many different customers. Channel intermediaries also reduce the number of transactions by creating assortments--providing a variety of products in one location--so that customers can conveniently buy many different items from one seller at one time.
* Channel intermediaries also perform a number of facilitating functions, which make the purchase process easier for customers and manufacturers. For example, intermediaries often provide important customer services, such as offering credit to buyers. Most of use like to shop at department stores because, if we are not happy with the rpoduct, we can take it back to the store,  where customer service personnel are happy to give us a refund. These same customer services are even mroe important in business-to-business markets in which customers purchase larger quanitties of higher priced products than in consumer markets. Some wholesalers and retailers assist the manufacturer by providing repair and maintenance service for product they handle. An appliance, television, stero, or computer dealer may serve as an authorized repair centre, provide maintenance contracts, and sell essential supplies to customers
* Finally, international distribution channels can make global marketing eaiser. Even small companies can be success in global markets by relying on distributors that know local custom and laws.
* We've discussed what a distribution channel is and some of the function it performs. What are the different types of channel intermediaries and channel structures?

## THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF CHANNELS
* How can you get your hands on a new U2 T-shirt? There are several ways. You could pick one up at your local music store or directly over the Internet (eBay.ca for example). You might buy an "official U2 concert T-shirt" from vendors during a show. Alternatively, you might get a "deal" on a bootlegged, unauthorized version of the same shirt being sold from a suitcase by a shady person standing outside the stadium before and after the event. Each of these distribution alternatives traces a different path from producer to consumer. Let's look at the different types of wholesaling intermediaries and at different channel structures. We'll focus on retailers, which are usually the last link in the chain, in the next chapter.

### Types of Wholesaling Intermediaries
* **Wholesaling intermediaries** are firms that handle the flow of products from the manufacturer to the retailer or business user. There are many different types of consumer and business-to-business wholesaling intermediaries. Some of  these are independent, but manufacturers and retailers can own them, too. Table below summarizes the important characteristics of each.
* **INDEPENDENT INTERMEDIARIES** Independent intermediaries do busienss with many different manufacturers and many different customers. Because they are not owned or controlled by any manufacturer, they make it possible for many manufacturers to serve customers throughout the world while keeping prices low.
* **Merchant wholesalers** are **independent intermediaries that buy goods from manufacturers and sell to retailers and other business-to-business customers. because merchant wholesalers take title to the goods--they actually have legal ownership of the goods--they assume certain ownership risks and can suffer losses if products get damaged, become out of date or obsolete, are stoken, or just don't sell.** At the same time, because they own the product, they are free to develop their own marketing strategies, including setting the prices they charge their customers.
* Full-service merchant wholesalers, as the name suggests, provide a wide range of services for their customers. These services may include delivery, credit, product-use assistance, repairs, advertising and other promotion support, and market research. Full-service wholesalers often have their own sales force to call on business and organizational customers.
* One type of full-service merchant wholesaler is a rack jobber. Rack jobbers supply retailers with such specialty items as health and beauty products, magazines, and books. Rack jobbers get their name because they own and maintain the product display rack in grocery, drug, and variety stores. These wholesalers visit their retail customers on a regular basis to maintain levels of stock and refill their racks with merchandise.
* In contrast, limited-service merchant wholesalers provide fewer services for their customers. Like full-service wholesalers, they take title to merchandise, but they are less likely to provide such services as delivery, credit, or marketing assistance to retailers.
* Cash-and-carry wholesalers provide low-cost merchandise for retailers and industrial customers that are too small for other wholesalers' sales representattives to call on. Customers pay cash for products and provide their own delivery. Some popular cash-and-carry product categories include groceries, office supplies, building materials, and electrical supplies.
* Truck-jobbers carry their products to small business customer locations for their inspection and selecction. Truck jobbers often supply such perishable items as fruit, vegetable, and meats to small grocery stores. The bakery truck jobber calls on supermarkets, check the stock of bread on the shelf, removes any outdated items, and suggests how much bread the store needs to order.
* Drop shippers are limited function wholesalers that take title to the merchandise but never actually take possession of it. Drop shipper take orders from and bill retailers and industrial buyers, but the merchandise is shipped directly from the manufacturer. Because they take title to the merchandise, they assume the same risk as other merchant wholesalers. Drop shippers are important to both the producers and ustomers of bulky products such as coal, oil, or lumber.
* Mail-order wholesaler sell products to small retailers and other industrial customers, often located in remove areas, through catalogues rather than a sales force. They usually carry products in inventory and require payment in cash or by credit card before shipment. mail-order wholesalers supply such products as cosmetics, hardware, sporting goods, and general merchandise.
* **Merchandise agents or brokers** are another major type of independent intermediary. Agents and brokers provide services in exchange for commissions. They may or may not take possession of the product, but they never take title--they do not accept legal ownership of the rpoduct. Agents normally represent buyers or sellers on an ongoing basis, where clients employ brokers for a short period of time. PayPal, performs payment processing for online vendors, aution sites, and other corporate users, for which it charges for a fee.

# Chapter 11: Retailing and Etailing

## RETAILING: SPECIAL DELIVERY
* Shop till you drop! For many people, obtaining the product is half the fun. Others would rather walk over hot coals than spend time in a store. Marketers need to find ways to delivery products and services that please both types of consumers. Retailing is the final stop on the distribution path--the process by which goods and services are sold to consumers for their personal use.
* A retail outlet is often more than simply a place where you buy something. **The retailer adds or subtracts value from the offering with the image, inventory, service quality, location, and pricing policy.** In many cases, the shopping experience is what is being bought as well as the products we take home. That's what visitors to the Discovery Channel store in Washington, DC, get when they meet up with a life size model of a Tyrannosaurus rex on the main floor of the four level store. The place feels like a museum, with such attrations as a cockpit from a vintage WorldWar II plane. Similarly, part of Ikea's strategy is to make its stores a shopping destination with experience that encourage shoppers to spend more time there.
* Retailers are a special breed of marketers. They assemble and present products, often from many different manufacturers, in ways that make them appealing and accessible. And they often develop unique and exciting store images that are similar to t he product branding strategies we've already discussed. In this chapter, we explore the different types of retailers, comparing and contrasting them along some key dimensions, **keeping in mind that today's shoppers have many retail choices--boutiques, department stores, ordering by phone, and clicking on a website.**--whether a traditional one operating a store or a non-store retailer selling via television, phone, or computer--lure the consumer? These important marketing questions get more difficult to answer as the competition for customers intensifies. We start with an overview of where retailing has been and where it's going.

### Retailing: A Mixed (Shopping) Bag
* Retailing is big business. About one in eight Canadian workers is employed in retailing, and the sales for more than 217000 retail stores represent about 9.54 percent of Canada's gross domestic product--and that percentage is growing. Although we tend to associate huge chain like Ikea, Canadian Tire, and the Bay with retailing activity, most retailers (about 75 percent) are independent small businesses. Some retailers, such as Home Depot and Costco, are also wholsalers, and provide goods and services to busienss as well as end consumers. We saw how the wholesaling process works in the previous chapter (channel and distribution). Now, we'll focus on the process that delivers goods and services to individuals for their personal use.

### The Evolution of Retailing
Retailers have taken many forms over time, including the simple peddler who hawked his ware from a horse-drawn cart, a majestic urban department store, an intimate boutique, and a huge hypermarket that sells everything from potato chiips to snow tires. Old types of retailers routinely give way to new variations, as economic, social, and cultura developments change the face of society. That horse-drawn cart has been replaced by the cart that sits in the middle of your local mall, selling new-age jewellery or monogrammed golf balls to passerby en route to grab a plate of sushi in the food court or catch a movie at a state-of-the-art theatre. As times change, different types of retailers emerge, often replacing older, outmoded types. How can we understand and predict what the dominant types of retailing will be tomorrow or 10 years from nwo to be sure that we keep in step?
* **THE WHEEL OF RETAILING** One of the oldest and simplest explanations for these change is the wheel-of-retailing hypothesis. This states that new types of retailers find it easiest to enter the market by offering goods at lower prices than competitors. After they gain a foothold, they gradually trade up, improving their facilities, increasing the quality of merchandise, and offering amenities like parking and gift wrapping. This upscaling results in greater investment and operating costs, so the store must raise its prices to remain profitable, which they makes it vulnerable to still newer entrants that can afford to charge lower prices. And so the wheel turns. The wheel of retailing helps explain the development of some, but not all, forms of retailing. For example, some retailers never trade up, they simply continue to occupy a niche as discounters. Others, such as upscale specialty stores, start out at the high end.

# CHAPTER 12: INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

## TAILORING MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS
* See how many of the following you can answer:

                1. Name the tiger that says, "They're grrreat!"
                2. Name one or more products for which Tiger Woods is a spokesperson.
                3. What character is featured in Eveready battery ads?
                4. At Burger King, you can have it "_______", whereas at Harvey's the burgers are a "________"
                5. Which paper towl brand is "The Quicker Picker Upper"?

* Did you get them all right? You owe your knowledge about these and a thousand other trivia questions to the efforts of people who specialize in marketing communication.
* To reach customers, it is essential to get to know them and to talk their language--to communicate well. **Sometimes, it's as simple as creating an image for your product or company that matches customer preferences. For example, when research showed that the image of courier service UPS Canada was that of a boring, traditional, and old-fashion company, they knew that change was needed. A new communications campaign was developed to liven up UPS's image. It focused on their trusted and approachable drivers overcoming all obstacles to deliver their packages, with a tag line "MOve at the speed of your business." It worked. Customers now use words like "dynamic" and "comtemporary" to describe the company.**
* The coordination of a marketer's efforts to influence attitudes or behaviour used to be commonly called **promotion**. **While this term fits well as one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, it implies a one-way (asymmetrical) conversation from marketer to customer. Promotion-oriented  companies focus on diseeminating favourable information about products and services to mass audiences, or on using research to develop messages to persuade specific, targeted audiences to engage in desired behaviour. Today, technologies ranging from the Internet to digital wireless communication to "smart" products allow marketers to become much more interactive with customers. Many consumers expect to enter into a dialogue with an organization--to be informed, not manipulated, and to be assisted in making decision, not sold.**
* **Marketing communications** is the term now used most frequently to **describe the vital roles of informing consumers and customers about the relative value of products, and developing trust and other relational bonds that facilitate ongoing exchange relationships.** Marketing communications plays these roles for every type of business, whether its goal is to sell suits to executives or to encourage government to decrease taxes on gasoline. New two-way (symmetrical) appraoches to commmunication strategies help build better relationships--there is greater mutual understanding with two-way ongoing dialogue, more balance in relationships, and consequently greater commitment to brands and companies on the part of consumers and customers that usually result in greater long-term profitability.
* Marketing communications can taken many forms--**quirky television commercials, sophisticated magazine ads, Internet banner ads using the latest interactive technology, glaring billboards, funky T-shirts, or blimps drifting lazily over football stadiums.** Some of these communication activities are intended to communicate key messagese to a target audience. Others provide incentives to buy specific products. In each case, the communication is intended to accomplish specific goals.

                **
                * Communications inform consumers about new goods and services, and where they can be obtained.
                * Communications remind consumers to using products
                * Communications persuade consumers to choose one product over others
                * Communications create complex brand images and identities in the minds of consumers
                * Communications build relationship with customers
                **

## INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
* In the past, companies made little effort to coordinate the messages consumers received. **An advertising campaign would run independently of a sweepstakes, which in turn had no relation to a series of company-sponsored commmunity events. the consumer, however, does not see these items in isolation but instead as one stream of communication. it was often confusing and ineffective. But let's see how the rules have changed in the marketing communication business.**

### Coordinating Communication Messages
* Many marketing experts now believe that integrating all forms of marketing communications is essential for successful marketing. **Integrated marketing communication (IMC) is t he practice of unifying all marketing communication tools and corporate and brand messages to communicat in a consistent way to and with stakeholder audiences.** In a survey of marketing executives, IMC was rated the most important factor in marketing strategy--more important than consumer lifestyle changes, economic trends, new retail formats, or globalization.
* **The IMC philosophy recognizes that customers absorb information about a product or an organization from many sources, not all of which are formal communication messages or even under the marketer's control. It takes the recipients' perspective--anticipating every opportunity in which they see information about the good, service, or organization--and then ensures that each of these exposures commmunicates the desired message and elicits the intended response.** As the figure below illustrates, this approach still relies on a variety of communication tools and approaches, but it emphasizes the some are planned, some are unplanned, that all marketing mix decisions and contact points (such as the cleanliness of washrooms, convenice of parking, or even employee appearances) send messages to consumers or business customers, and that all are used in harmony to reach targeted consumers.

                Source of Planned Messages: Advertising, Sales Promotion, Public Relation, Direct Marketing, Personal Selling, Point-of-Purchase Displays, Packaging, Special Tires, Sponsorship, Licensing, Customer Service, Visual Identity, Issue/Crisis Management

                Sources of Unplanned Messages: Word of Mouth, Employee Gossip/Behaviour, Facilities, Transportation, Media & Government, Investigations

                Marketing Mix: (may be a source of planned or unplanned messages, depending on the company's planning strategy)

                        --> consumer/Customer Decision Process: pre-purchase, purchase, post-purchase

* When Lucky Brand Jeans (an American brand) opened its new store in Montreal, it used some innovative communication strategies to garner attention. According to company spokesperson, "Lucky Brand Jeans is very rooted in rock 'n' roll and the '70s era". The target for this premium brand is 30- to 55-year-olds. To capture the attention of its target audience, Lucky Brand hired a "street team" to camp out in front fo the store from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. the Wednesday before the opening, and then again at 7:30 a.m. the next day. **The company believed that having people wait in line outside a store in reminiscent of fans lining up for tickets to a concert. this ploy was an attempt to garner the attention of its target audience on the way to work. The store opening was also supported by print ads and transit advertising. The plan worked--close to 2000 people went through the store on opening day (compared to average traffic of 450 people a day in other stores).
* The IMC approach can assign relatively more importance to aspects of communication other than advertising. Some executives are reluctant to divert part of their communication budget from glamourous ads to coupons or contests, and some advertising agencies don't want to relinquish this piece of their business to other companies specializing in running sweepstakes or hosting town hall meetings.  **Utilizing an IMC appraoch, marketers plan and then execute marketing communication programs that create and maintain long-term relationships with customers by satisfying customer needs. This means that they use promotion tools to build ongoing loyal relationships with customers or other stakeholders, rather than simply causing a one-time product purchase or short-term change in behaviour.**
* **Brand managers and associate brand managers develop communication strategies at lower levels after senior planners have already developed the larger marketing strategy. But the IMC approach requires that upper-level management view other aspects of the marketing mix, such as packaging or pricing decisions, as part of the communication strategy.** A successful IMC approach requires a company-wide commitment, from the CEO down, to putting the customer first and communicating interactively with customers in many different channels. Some firms find it hard to change their habits.
* Some advertising agencies have not bought into the concept of IMC. Since they often do not have the full services required to deliver comprehensive programs, the solutions they offer their clients focus on their area of specialization, such as advertising or public relations.
* So why is IMC so important today? A few years ago, marketers could effectively communicate with consumers by placing a few ads on major television networks and perhaps in a few popular magazines. Today, with increased global compeition, customers are bombarded with more and more marketing messages--over 1400 advertising messages every day. And the sheer number of media outlets is also mushrooming. Marketers can choose from literally hundreds of cable and satellite stations, each of which can deliver its messages t o a selected portion of the television viewing audience. **All this means that consumers are less likely to be influenced by any single marketer-generated message. At the same time, technology now enables even small firms to develop and effectively use customer databases, giving firms greater opportunities for understanding customers and for developing one-to-one communication programs. And technology gives customers the ability to communicate among themselves about products and companies and even to view ads on the Internet and TV at their leisure.**

### Characteristics of IMC
* To fully understand what IMC is all about and before a firm can begin to implement an IMC program, **it is essential that managers understand some important characterisitics of IMC.**
* **IMC CREATES A SINGLE UNIFIED VOICE** Perhaps the most important characteristic of IMC is that it creates a single unified voice for a firm. **If we examine the traditional communication program of a typical consumer goods firm--say, a manufacturer of frozen foods--we see that it often develops communication tactics in isolation.** If its marketers decide they need advertising, what do they do? **They hire an ad agency to produce great advertising. Or they may even hire several ad agencies to develop advertising aimed at different target markets. They may also realize they need public relation activities, so they hire a public relation firm. Then some other genius decides to sponsor a sweepstakes and hires a sales promotion firm to do this. The sales department hires a different firm to develop trade show materials, and someone in the corporate communication department hires a sport-marketing firm to work on sponsoring an auto race.**
* **Each of these firms may well do a good job, but each may also be sending out a different message. The customer can't help but be confused. What is the product? What is the brand image? Whose needs will this product satisfy?** IMC strategies present a unified selling proposition in the marketplace by eliminating duplication and conflicting communication. Because a company develops an IMC program as a whole, there is a focus on all communication elements--advertising, public relations, sales promotion, and so forth--speaking with one voice, creating a single and powerful brand personality.
* Having a single brand message, however, doesn't mean that marketers don't communicate to different segments of the market or to different stakeholder groups with different tactics. They can communicate the same brand message.
* **Have a single brand message, however, doesn't mean that marketers don't communicate to different segments of the market or to different stakeholder groups with different tactics. They can communicate the same brand message to employees with a story in the company newsletter about how local workers have helped flood victims, to loyal customers via direct mail that explains how to make their home safe for toddlers, and to prospective customers through mass media and Internet advertising.**
* The one-voice/one-message focus of IMC also considers other less obvious forms of communication. **For example, a firm's communication includes the letters it sends to vendors and customers (even the stationery the company uses), the way company personnel talk on the phone with clients or customers, the uniforms that delivery people or other employees wear, signage, and other policies and procedures that may have an unintended effect on consumers' perceptions of the firm.
* **IMC BEGINS WITH THE CUSTOMER** **The customer is the primary focus of the communication, not the goals of the company or the creative genius of the communication specialists.** First and foremost, the goal of IMC is to **provide the information customers want when they want it, where they want it, and in the amount needed**. Sometimes that's as simple as letting consumers "vote" on the shows or products they want to see, as when fans of the hit TV comedy Friends were allowed to choose their six favourite episodes at a website when the producers decided to end the series.
* **IMC SEEKS TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS** As mass-marketing activities have become less effective, **many marketers are finding that the road to success is through one-to-one marketing, in which the focus is on building and maintaining a long-term relationship with each individual customer. To achieve this, marketers must continuously communicate with each customer or else risk losing him or her to the competition.
* What we said earlier repeating--it is easier and less expensive to keep an existing customer than to attract a new one. Thus, **IMC firms also measure their success by sharing of customer, not share of market, and by the lifetime value of a customer.** This means prioritizing customers so that greater resources go to communicating with high-value buyers or clients.
* **Because IMC is also about building and maintaining relationships with customers, IMC strategies often rely on CRM programs.** With these tools, marketers have the information they need to better understand customers and to deliver unique messages to each consumer--messages that meet the needs of each consumer and that build relationships.
* **IMC INVOLVES TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION** Traditional communication programs were built on one-way communication activities. Television, magazine, newspaper, and outdoor advertising spouted clever messages at the consumer, but there was little if any way for the consumer to talk back. **Today, we know that one-way, impersonal communication is highly ineffective at building long-term relationships with customers. Instead, marketers seek first to learn what information customers have and what additional information they want and then develop communication tactics that let them share information with their customers.**
* **IMC FOCUSES ON STAKEHOLDERS, NOT JUST CUSTOMERS** As we discussed in Chapter 1, stakeholders are any individuals or organizations that are important to the long-term health of an organization. Some of these stakeholders include employees, suppliers, stockholders, the media, trade associations, regulators, and even neighbors. one reason these other stakeholders are so important is that customers and prospective customers don't learn about a company and its products just from the firm. Their attitudes, positive or negative, are also heavily influenced by the mass media, government regulatory bodies, or even their neighbour who happens to work for the company. Thus, while the primary stakeholder is usually the customer, myriad other groups of individuals can significantly influence customers' attitudes and behaviours.
* **IMC GENERATES A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF COMMUNICATION** A major characteristic of an IMC strategy is that tactics using many different elements of the communication program--advertising, publicity, personal selling, sales promotion, customer testimonials, and so on--are included in a single IMC plan. As a result, IMC strategies provide a continuous stream of communication. Instead of consumers being bombarded with messages from various sources for a week or two and then hearing nothing from the brand for months, IMC planning ensures that consumers receive information on a regular basis and in the right amount.
* **IMC MEASURES RESULTS BASED ON ACTUAL FEEDBACK** Many IMC boosters suggest that the only adequate measure of a promotional campaign's effectiveness is to evaluate the return on investment on commmunication dollars (earlier we referred to this as "marketing ROI"). This means that if a firm spends $1 million on advertising, it should be able to determine what dollar amount of revenue the firm receives as a result of that expenditure. While this type of relationship between  prmotion dollars and revenues may be difficult to measure exactly because of things such as the long-term effects of advertising and other marketing communications, most firms are seeking measures of accountability for their commmunication budgets and demand results.

### IMC and Database Marketing
* The effective use of database is crucial for building relationships with consumers, a key characteristic of IMC. **The development of a customer database allows an organization to learn about the preferences of its customers, fine-tune its offerings, and build an ongoing relationship with its market.**
* Some companies have maintained a customer database for years, but until recently most have not linked the database with their marketing communication activites. **Database marketing** is the creation of an ongoing relationship with a set of customers with an identifiable interest in a good or service and whose responses to promotion efforts become part of the ongoing communication process.
* Let's look at an example of how an IMC firm might make effective sue of database marketing. **What if you ordered a dozen roses to be delivered to a friend for his or her  birthday last year? You (and your friend) have become a part of the florist's database. What are the possibilities for the florist? First, the database is a gold mine of information. By examining (the data mining we discussed in Chapter 4) the records of thousands of customers, including you, the florist can find out which customers order flowers frequently (heavy users) and which order only occasionally (light users). They can identify customers who order flowers for themselves, usually when they entertain. They know which customers order flowers only for funerals, and which send flowers to their sweethearts. And they can determine what type of customer accounts for their greatest sales and their greatest profits. This helps them to develop a better understanding of their target markets.
* **Of course, using the information in the database for understanding a firm's market is only the beginning. Even more important is how firms such as our florist use the database to create that one-to-one communication with their target markets. So you, our florist's customer, may get a call or an email next year reminding you of your friend's birthday and asking if you want the same dozen roses (well, actually, fresh ones of the same type) sent again this year. *The customer who entertains frequently may received a brochure before the New year's holiday season that shows various table arrangements. Heavy users might receive a special thank-you for their business and an offer to receive a free arrangement after purchasing 12 arrangements.* And by the way, what about your friend who received flowers but who has never purchased from our florist? Since we may assume that a consumer who likes to receive flowers will sooner or later want to purchase t hem as well, she becomes part of the florist's prospective customer database. As such, she may receive a catalogue of the most popular arrangements or perhaps a coupons ofr a discount on her first order.**
* The following list explains what database marketing can do.
1. **Database marketing is interactive: Interactive marketing** elicits a response from consumers, be it filling out an order form or calling an 800 number for product information. For example, H.J Heinz sent a mail piece to female cat owners that asked the provocative question, "Does he sleep with you?" If the woman completes a brief survey that tells the company more about her pet foor preferences, she receives a personalized thank-you note that mentions her pet by name. She is also entered into the company's database so that she will receive future communications about her feline friend. This type of interactivity gives marketers more than one opportunity to develop a dialogue with the customer and possibly to create add-on sales by engaging the customer in a discussion about the product and related items or services in which she might be interested.
* **Database marketing builds relationships**: **it's easier for the marketer to build promotion programs that continue over time with database marketing because the marketer can best adapt them in light of consumers' responses. The best predictor of who will buy a product is knowing who bought in the past. That's why Reader's Digest's 12 full-time statisticans sort its customers by likellihood of purchase and predict the probability that each will respond to a given offer. Once sophisticated database marketers know who has already purchased, they can keep in touch with these consumers on an ongoing basis. They can reward loyal customers with money-saving coupons and keep them informed of upcoming prizes and promotions.** As one executive whose company tracks big ticket customer explained, "They are members of a club, but they don't know they are members"
* **Database marketing locates new customers**: **In some cases, a marketers can create new customers by focusing communications on likely prospects with characteristics similar to current users. For example, Dial sent coupon mailings about rust stains to neighbours of people in Des Moines, lowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, who use its Sno-Bol toilet bowl cleaner. The brand's sales volume jumped 81 percent in a 12-week period."**
* **Database marketing stimulates cross-selling**: **Database marketers can find it easy to offer related products to their customers. Interest in one product category boosts the odds that the customer is a good candidate for similar items. This explains why companies bombard consumers with mail offers for computer software, magazines, or clothing after they purchase a similar product over the phone or through a catalogue.** Hershy Direct, a division of Hershy Foods Corp, that sells limited-edition collectible elf figurines (not the chocolate kind), test its database by sending some mailings to only its most serious collectors, while its other mailing measure the potential of other database segments. Somme mailings have included questionaires regarding specific collectible interests such as plates and music boxes to help the company decide on future product offerings.
* **Database marketing is measurable**: **A common complaint of many marketers is the difficulty of pinpointing the impact a promotion had on the target market--what is a specific promotion's ROI? Who can say for sure that a single TV commercial motivated people to switch colas? But the database marketers know exactly who received a specific message, so they are able to measure the effectiveness of each communication.**
* **Responses are trackable**: **The marketer can assess the proportion of message recipients who responded, compare the effectiveness of different messages, and compile a history of which consumers are most likely to respond over time. Farm equipment manufacturer John Deere targeted 20,000 farmers who were loyal to other brands. using a list of farmers who owned commpeting equipment, Deere sent prospects a series of four mailings spaced over eight weeks, each with an inexpensive gift such as a stopwatch that was related to the theme of saving time and money by replacing existing equipment. The campaign brought 5800 farmers into the showroom, yielding a 29 percent response rate. Nearly 700 of these consumers bought new equipment, resulting in more than $40 million in new business.**

*MY: My biggest take-away is this chapter is use database-marketing as much as I can, facebook ads, mailchimp, etc

## COMMUNICATION
* Like other marketing mix decisions, marketing communication strategy is based on a solid understanding of the target market, the decision environment, and marketing concepts, principles, and theory. In this next section we will explore the central communication theory and models on which communication decisions are based.

### The Communication Model
* With either one-way or two-way communication, the consumer is the focal point: A message is transmitted on some medium from a sender to a receiver who (it is hoped) is paying attention and understands the sender. Regardless of how messages are sent, whether as a hat with a Roots logo on it or a sales pitch from an Aveda representative, messages are designed to capture receiver's attention and relate to their needs. With two-way communication, the receiver sends a message back to the original sender, opening a dialogue between the parties.
* Any ways that marketers reach out to consumers, from simple highway billboards to customized messages sent via e-mail to busy executvies, are part of the basic communication process. The communication model specifies that a number of elements are necessary for communication to occur--a source, a message, a medium, and a receiver. Figure below shoes the communication model.


                Source: * Company; * Individual
                ->(encoding)->

                Message: * Advertising; * Public relation; * Sales promotion; * Salesperson pitch; * Communication from consumers

                ->

                Medium: Magainzes; newspapers; television; radio; billboards; direct mail; word of mouth

                ->(decoding)->

                * Receiver: Consumer

                -> Feedback: Purchase data; product awareness; brand loyalty;

                (Noise(competing messages) affects everything)

* **ENCODING BY THE MARKETER** It is one thing for marketers to create an idea about a product in their minds and **quite another to express that idea so that other people get the same picture.** Encoding is the process of translating an idea into a form of communication that will convey the desired meaning. Consider how different companies have used a dog to symbolize their brand. Microcell's Fido, a personal communication (PCS) product, has successfully used dogs in its commmunications to help us draw linkages to its servcies being as faithful and commpanionable as "man's best friend". RCA has introduced a second dog (a puppy) into its logo to communicate that it's always innovating--the best of old and new and Greyhound Bus Lines has successfully used a greyhound dog to convey fast and sleek service. Many other animals have been used by many other companies to convey brand meaning: Can you think of some?
* **THE SOURCE** The source is the organization or individual sending the message. **Marketers must choose a real person (e.g., company president Galen Weston for Loblaws), hire an actor or model (e.g., Canadian country singer Shania Twain for Revlon), or create a character (e.g., Mr. Peanut for Planters Peanuts) who will represent the source.**
* **THE MESSAGE** The message is the actual communication sent from a sender to a receiver. **The message should ideally accomplish four objectives (though a single message can rarely do all of these): *It should get attention, hold interest, create desire, and produce action*.** These communication goals are known as the AIDA model, which will be discussed further later in this chapter. Message may include both verbal and nonverbal elements, such as beautiful background scenery or funky music. These elements must be carefully constructed so that they can connect with a wide variety of consumers or business customers. In contrast, the message a salesperson delivers can be carefully tailored for each individual custommer, and the salesperson can respond to questions or objections.
* **THE MEDIUM** No matter how the message is encoded, it must then be  trasmitted via a medium, a commmunication vehicle used to reach members of a target audience. This vehicle can be television, radio, a magazine, personal contact, a billboard, or even a product logo printed on a coffee mug. **Ideally, the attributes of the product should match those of the medium. For example, magazines with high prestige are more effective at communicating messages about overall product image and quality, whereas specialized magazines do a better job of conveying factual information.**
* **DECODING BY THE RECEIVER** Communication can not occur unless there is a receiver to intercept the message. Assuming in our overloaded, media-saturated society--the meaning of the message is interpreted in light of that individual's unique experience. Decoding is the process whereby a receiver assigns meaning to a message. We hope that the target consumer will decode the message the way we had intended. Effective commmunication occurs only when the source and the receiver have a mutual frame of reference. They must share the same understanding about the world. Grabbing the receiver's attention is more likely if **the message source is someone the receiver likes, the message is creatively executed, and the medium is one the receiver typically notices.** Furthermore, it helps if the subject of the message is something that is personally relevant. The most enticing shampoo ad in the world probably won't be noticed by a bald man.
* To improve the abilities of organizations to focus their commmunication efforts on receptive receivers, companies are slicing the mass market into smaller and smaller target audiences. In a truly interactive environment, communication efforts will look more like door-to-door selling than like television advertising. Even the Coca-Cola Company, which has long been known for extravagant network productions, is looking for alternatives to big-budget, mass0market commercials. **One recent campaign, produced by Creative Artists Agency, has 24 ads in many moods and styles developed for 20 different television netowrks. These range from one done in "quick-cut" style for MTV to a star-trek style spot called "spaceship", intended to appeal to teenage boys.** These changes make sense, because the more recipient can identify with the message, the greater the probability they will reach for a Coke.
* **Noise** The communication model also acknowledge that messages often are blocked by noise, which is anything that interferes with effective commmunication. Competing marketing communications cause noise, as do other things happening in the environment that divert the receiver's attention. Marketers try to minimize noise by placing their messages where there is less likely to be distractions or competition for consumers' attention. For example, companies such as Calvin Klein often buy a block of advertising pages in a magazine to be sure the reader sees only picutres of their clothing. Some advertisers are now using black and white ads in colour magazines or on television to break through the noise. 
* **FEEDBACK** To complete the commmunication loop the source receives feedback, or reactions, from receivers. These reactions to the message help the marketer gauge the appeal's effectiveness and fine-tune it. **Obtaining feedback reminds us of the importance of conducting marketing research to verify that a firm's strategy are working. The area of feedback is where newer symmetrical communication techniques based on IMC outperform the traditional asymmetrical approaches. By listening to the feedback provided by consumers and customers, organizations can be more responsive to the information needs of consumers and develop closer and stronger relationships with them.

### The FCB Grid
* There are many other communication framworks and models. In Chapter 5(Consumer buying behaviour) we introduced the FCB grid that categorized consumer decisions as being primarily thinking (cognitive) and feeling (affective) and high involvement or low involvement. This model has useful communication implications as different communication strategies and tactics are appropriate in each of t he four quadrants.
* High involvement-thinking decisions, for example, call for informative communication strateiges and tactics such as comparative advertising or demonstrations, and detail-accommodating media **such as print, informercials, and the Internet.** Low involvement-feeling decisions, on the other hand, call for **image-oriented strategies and tactics such as lifestyle advertising or sex appeals and immediate response media such as lifestyle advertising or sex appeals and immediate response media such as point-of-purchase displays. 
* There are a number of limintations associated with the FCB grid, including its simplicity, its inability to differentiate product attitude and motivations from brand attitudes and motivations, and its lack of recognition of the need to create brand awareness before brand attitudes. There are more sophisticated models suchas Rossiter and Percy RPG grid, but hese models are best left to advanced marketing communication classes. Because of its simplicity, the FCB grid is widely used and provides a useful way to think about marketing communication strategy. It also relates nicely to value creation strategies. "Thinking" decisions are concerned with functional value and cost-sacrifice value while "feeling" decisions are concerned with experiential and symbolic value.

                Thinking(Rational/Cognitive) + High Involvement
                Information communication 
                creative strategy: specific information; demonstrations; comparative advertising;
                Media strategy: long copy formats; megazine & newspaper; infomercials; internet

                Feeling (Emotional /Affective) + High Involvement

## DEVELOPING COMMUNICATION PLANS AND BRIEFS
* A marketing manager has to identify the specific combination of communication tools that will meet the company's objectives in the most effective and cost-efficient way. To ensure that companies develop an IMC strategy, the smart manager first develops a commmunication plan, a framwork for developing, implementing, and controlling the firm's communication activities.
* **Communication agencies typically have three main function areas: communication strategy, creative, and media placement. Large agencies may also have in-house market research and Internet/mobile communication capability. Communication planning and strategy is the domain of the "suits"--the account management people with business diplomas and degrees who understand target audiences, marketing strategy, communication theory, and how to develop the strategic elements of a communication plan.** An effective communication plan addresses the elements illustrated in figure below. **A communication brief is a summary (typically three or four pages) of the elements in figure below that is used by creative team to ensure that the creative execution is on-strategy.

### Step 1: Identfy the Target Audience
* Marketing communication strategy is designed to achieve marketing objectives such as those dicussed in Chapter 2 and, as previously discussed, is based on an understanding of the decision environment and specific target markets. We will discuss the influences of teh decision environment after reviewing communication mix alternatives. The target market is identified from research and segmentation decisions, which we discussed in Chapter 4. A target audience is the group or set of individuals or organizations with whom you want to communicate. **This may be the same as the target market, but often target audiences are more specific. For example, the target market for Burton Snowboards may be status-conscious boarders, 15 to 25 years old, but the target audience for a specific communication campaign may be female status-conscious boarders, 15 to 25 years old, living in greater Vancouver.**
* **There may be more than one target audience within a target market. For example, the audiences may have different media watching and reading habits, may live in different geographic areas reached by different TV or radio stations, or may be persuaded by different types of information or appeals. Target audience profiles are also typically more detailed than target market profiles--particularly in the areas of media use and communication strategy and tactic preferences or responsiveness. For example, an account executive working on a campaign for Pioneer Stereo was assigned to hang out with guys who were likely prospects to buy car stereos. His observations resulted in an advertising campaign that incorporated the phrases they used to describe their cars: "My car is my holy temple, my love shack, my drag racer of doom..." To make our communications more effective we need to know the target audience's values, attitudes, interests, opinions, and anything else that might affect how they receive, process, store, and use information. This additional information helps marketers to hone their integrated communication strategies to successfully reach consumers with the right message, in the right place, in the right time, and with the right offer.

                Stages in developing the communication plan
                1. Identify the target audience
                2. Establish communication objectives
                3. Determine communication strategy approach
                4. Develop key messages and positioning statement
                5. Design the communication mix
                6. Determine and allocate budget
                7. implement creative strategy
                8. Evaluate

### Step 2: Establish Communication Objectives
* The point of developing a communication strategy is to connect the marketing plan to consumers, to let them know that the organization has a product to meet their needs in a timely and affordable way. It's bad enough when a product comes along that people don't want or need; **perhaps a bigger marketing sin is to have a product that they do want, but fail to let them know about it.** **As creative as some advertisers or salespeople are, it is rare that any one communication element could cause a consumer who has never heard of a product to become aware of it, prefer it over competing products, and buy it on the spot.** An exception is novelty or impulse items, which are bought on a whim. Think of this communication road as an uphill climb--as the hill gets steeper, the later steps, which are forming a preference for the rpoduct and actually buying it, get tougher. During the climb, many people drop out, so only a small proportion of the target market actually reaches the top of the hill to become loyal customers. Each part of this path can entail different communication objectives to "push" people to the next level in their decision processes (see Chapter 5 and 6 for a review of decision models).
* To understand how this process works, consider how a company would have to adjust its communication objectives as it tries to establish a presence in the market for a new men's cologne called Hunk. Let's say that the primary target market for the cologne is single men, aged 18 to 24, who care about their appearance and who are into health, fitness, and working out. The company would want to focus more on some communication methods (such as advertising) and less on others (such as personal selling). These are some steps the company might take to promote Hunk:

* Create awareness. The first step is to make members of the marget market aware that there's a new brand of cologne on the market. This would be accomplished by simple repetitive advertisements in magazines, on television, and on the radio that feature the brand name. The selection of the specific magazines, television shows, and radio stations would be based on knowing what men 18 to 24 years old are reading, watching, and listening to. The company might even undertake a teaser campaign, in which interest is heightened by not revealing the exact nature of the product (e.g., newspaper ads that simply proclaim, "Hunk is coming!") The communication objective might be to create an 80 percent awareness of Hunk cologne among 18 to 24 year of men in the first two months in the three Prairie provinces.
* Inform the market. The next step would be to provide prospective users with knowledge about the benefits the new product has to offer; that is, how it is positioned relative to other gragrances (see Chapter 8). Perhaps the cologne has a light, slightly, mentholated scent that smells vaguely like liniments men use after a workout. Communication efforts would focus on message and images that emphasize this position. **The objective at this point might be to communication the connection between Hunk and muscle building, so that 75 percent of the target market becomes interested in the product.**
* Create desire. The next task is to create favourable feelings toward the product and to convince at least some portion of this group that it is preferable to other colognes they now wear. Communication at this tage might emphasize splashy advertising spreads in magazines, perhaps including an endorsement by a well-known celebrity "hunk", such as Arnold Schwarzenegger. **The specific objective might be to create positive attitudes toward Hunk cologne among 50 percent of the target market and brand preference among 30 percent of the target market.**
* Encourage trial. The company now needs to get some of the men who have formed a preference for the product to splash it on. A communication plan might encourage trial by mailing samples of Hunk to members of the target market, inserting scratch and sniff samples in bodybuilding magazines, placing elaborate displays in stores that dispense money-saving coupons, or even sponsoring a contest in which the winner gets to have Arnold Schwarzenegger as his personal trainer for a day. **The specifci objective now might be to encourage trial of Hunk among 25 percent of 18 to 24 year old men in the first two months in the three Prairie provinces.**
* Build loyalty. Now the company must focus on building loyalty: convincing customers to keep buying the cologne after they've gone through the first bottle. Communication efforts must maintain ongoing communications with current users to reinforce the bond they feel with the product. This will be accomplished with some mix of strategies, including periodic advertising, special event for users, and maybe even the development of a workout clothing line bearing the fragrance's logo. **The objective might be to develop and maintain regular usage of Hunk cologne over 18 months among 10 percent of 18 to 24 year old men in the three prairie provinces**

* In Chapter 8 we discussed the concept of the product life cycle. Marketers recognize that different communication objectives are particularly relevant in each life cycle stage. **In the introduction stage, marketers need to make consumers or customers aware of their offering and help them become knowledgeable about it. In the growth stage, when competition increases, marketers pay most attention to creating desire and differentiating their brands. In the mature stage, the focus is mostly on increasing market share, encouraging trial from new users or encouraging non-users to switch brands, and building loyalty. In the decline stage the focus is predominantly on encouraging loyal customers to repeat their purchases and increase consumption.** It should be noted, however, that all communication objectives are evident in marketing campaign at each stage of the product life cycle, as marketers need to help consumers complete their decision process at each stage.

### Step 3: Determine Communication Strategy/Approach
* The communicatino strategy describes the overall approach to the communication. For example, when LG Canada launched its new line of high-definition televisions, it built a golf hold in downtown Montreal and invited people to take a swing. participants whose shot landed within 52 inches of the hole were entered into a draw to win a 52-inch HD television. This launch campaign also included television ads, print ads, and Internet ads.
* IMC is one way to describe an overall strategy. Another is whether the strategy is a push strategy or a pull strategy. A **push strategy** means that the company wants to move its products by convincing channel members to offer them and entice their customers to select these items. In this case, promotion efforts will "push" the products from producer to consumers **by focusing on personal selling, trade advertising, and sales promotion activities such as exhibits at trade shows**.
* In contrast, a company relying on a **pull strategy** is counting on consumers to desire its products and thus convince retailers to respond to this demand by stocking them. In this case, efforts will focus on media advertising and consumer sales promotion to stimulate interest among end consumers who will "pull" the product onto store shelves and then into their shopping carts.
* Whether we use a push or a pull strategy and how the promotion mix for a product is designed must vary over time because some elements work better at different points in the product life cycle than others.

### Step 4: Develop Key Messages and Positioning Statement
* Once the overall approach to the communication strategy is established, marketers need t odecide what they want to communicate to their audience(s). In Chapter 3 we discussed the concept of positioining. **A positioning statement is one- to three- sentence summary of the product positioning--how you want a product to be known in the minds of customers as being different from, and better than, competitive offers.**
* Benjamin Moore, for example, **recently changed its corporate positioning statement to "Benjamin Moore is in the business of helping discerning customers creating an atmosphere, express their style and personality, and add value to their homes, through the use of color."**
* It then conducted extensive research to understand its target audience of home decorators, and learned that home decorators constantly scour magazines, rip out pages, and put them into a file for later use, seeking inspirational decorating ideas for their home. **It captured its positioning for this audience in the expression "Color as Inspiration", and developed a personalized "My Scapbook" feature on the Benjamin Moore website.**
* Communication purists would suggest that the positioning statement should focus on the one, maybe two, ways in which a marketing organization wants its product to be differentiated for a particular audience. Under this perspective, the positioning statement is similar to the concept of a unique selling proposition (USP)--the number one message a marketer wants to convey to an audience. **A good example of a USP is "M&M"'s melt in your mouth, not in your hands". Recently, Subaru launched its new Impreza model. It positioned the car as "the Japanese car the Germans wish they had made". The positioning aims to reinforce the automaker's Japanese heritage, while associating it with the excellent engineering of German cars.
* Other key messages are what you want to communicate to your target market, and these are typically listed in a communication plan in order of priority. That way, the marketer can evaluate the communication media and assess how many messages can be reasonably communicated by that media. Billboards, for example, can typically accommodate only one message. A 30-second radio spot might accommodate three or four messages. Magazine and newspaper ads can accommmodate more messages.

### Step 5: Design the Communication Mix
* The communication mix section discusss the theme and approach(es) that will break through the perceptual screens, get the attention of the target audience, and be consistent with the voerall strategy and positioning.
* * An **advertising appeal** is the central idea of the ad and a **creative concept** is how that idea will be expressed through visuals, text, music, and other design elements. While advertising appeals and creative concepts are typically the domain of the creative department within an agency, a commmunication plan needs to set some boundaries on the creative process to ensure that the creative is on strategy and is consistent with the communication objectives, target audience, and positioning.
* The message should ideally accomplish four objectives (although a single message can rarely do all of these). it should ***hold attention, hold interest, create desire, and produce action. These commmunication goals are known as the AIDA mmodel.*** here we'll review some different forms the message can take, as well as how the information in the message can best be structured.
* **TYPE OF APPEAL** Because there are many ways to say the same thing, marketers must choose what type of appeal, or message strategy, they will use when encoding the message. To illustrate how the choice of an appeal can result in a different communication, compare two strategies selected by rival car companies to promote similar automobiles. A few years ago, Toyota and Nissan both introduced a large luxury car that sold for over $50,000. **Toyota's advertising for its lexus model used a rational appeal, which focused on the technical advancements in the car's design. This approach is often effective for promoting products that are technically complex and that are a substantial investment.**
* In contrast, Nissan's campaign for its Infiniti model used an emotional appeal, an attempt to arouse good feelings in the consumer. The new car was introduced with a series of print and television ads, which focused on the Zen-like experience of driving and featured long shots of serene landscapes. As one executive with the campaign explained, "we're not selling the skin of the car; we're selling the spirit."
* **STRUCTURE OF THE APPEAL** Many marketing messages are similar to debates or trials, in which someone presents arguments and tries to convince the receivers to shift their opinions accordingly. The way the argument is presented can be important. Most messages merely present one or more positive attributes about the product or reasons to buy it: These are supportive argument or one-sided messages. An alternative is to use a two-sided message, with both positive and negative information. Two-sided ads can be quite effective, but marketers do not use them very often. **A related issue is whether the argument should draw conclusions: Should the ad say only "our brand is superior", or should it add the message that the consumer should buy the brand? The answer depends on the consumer's motivation to think about the ad and the complexity of the argument** If the message is personally relevant, people will pay attention to it and spontaneously draw their own conclusions. However, if the arguments are hard to follow or the person's motivation to follow them is lacking, it is safer for the ad to make these conclusions explicit.
* Communication experts come up with many ingenious way to express a concept. Consistent with the FCB grid, some marketers use an emotional appeal complete with dramatic colour or powerful images, whereas others bombard the audience with facts. Some feature sexy people or stern-looking experts (even professors from time to time). Different appeals can work for the same product, from a bland "talking head" to a montage of animated special effects. An attention getting way to say something profound about cat food or laundry detergent is more art than science, but we can describe some common appeals.

* **Informative appeal**: Gives consumers one or more clear reasons why one product is a good choice for solving a problem. The format focuses on a need and point out how the product can satisfy it.
* **Comparative advertising**: A compartive advertisement explictly name two or more competitors. The Pepsi challenge is an example of a comparative advertising campaign that has been used successfully over a long period of time. Comparative ads like the Pepsi challenge can be very effective, but there is a risk of turning off consumers who don't like the negative tone. This is especially a problem in cultures that don't take kindly to impolite messages. For instance, Tokyo's five major television networks pulled a Pepsi comparative ad because Japanese viewers found it offensitve to be too blunt.
* **Demonstration**: The ad shows a product "in action" to prove that it performs as claimed: "it slice, it dices!" This appeal helps sell products that people "use". 
* **Testimonial** A celebrity, an expert, or a "typical person" states the product's effectiveness. The use of celebrity endorsers is a common but expensive strategy. it is particularly effective for mature products, which need to differentiate themselves from competitors. 3M Canada, for example, used comedian Steve Smith (otherwise known as Red Green) as the spokesperson for one of its mature products--the Scotch brand duct tape. Chrysler dropped Celine Dion (and walked away from a US$14 million contract!) as a celebrity endorser of its Pacifica crossover car (part SUV, station wagon, and minivan) after finding she was two young to appeal to the Pacifica's target market.
* **Slice-of-Life** A slice of life format presents a (dramatized) scene from everyday life. Today, advertisers are trying to expand their definition of "everyday life". An ad for "Spray 'n' Wash Stain Stick from Dow Chemical, for example, shows a mother and her Down syndrome child. The mother comments, "The last place we need another challenge is the laundry room" One advertising critic described the spot as "the most crassly contrived slide-of-life in advertising history" But the American National Down Syndrom Congress applaud the ad and award Dow its annual media award.
* **Lifestyle**: A lifestyle format shows a person or persons attrative to the target market in an appealing setting. The advertised product is "part of the scene", implying that the person who buys it will attain the lifestyle. For example, a commercial shown on MuchMusic might depict a group of snowboarders having fun and then taking time to drink a McCain fruit drink. A fantasy format is a variation of the lifestyle approach in which the viewer is encouraged to imagine being transported to a novel or exotic situation. Ads for some Canadian Lotteries show fantasy lifestyles that ticket purchasers can achieve if they win the lottery. R K Swamy/BBDO used a lifestyle appeal to sell Apple's Performa by focusing on how the computer empowers children to pursue their potential. It created print ads and television commercials that plugged the Performa by showing parents and children using it to expand their horizons. The goal was to create ad messages that are warm and friendly, "feel-good" ads that would humanize the technology behind Apple's products and show potential buyers how the home computer could improve their lives.
* **Fear Appeals**: This format highlights the negative consequences of using or not using a product. fear appeals are often used to get the attention of audiences for social messages like not drinking and driving, not smoking, and safe sex. The Quebec government and its agency Marketel, for example, recently developed a campaign to help increase awareness of AIDS and expose the source of the danger. While the images are provocative and disturbing, the intent was to get their audience's attention. Fear appeals are also used by private-sector marketers, but typically with less disturbing images aimed at illustrating the problem of not buying a particular good or service. The British Columbia Automobile Association, for example, developed a campaign that humorously showed the problems of now having a BCAA membership, and being stranded in potentially scary situations.
* **Sex appeals** Some ads apepar to be selling sex rather than products. This was the case in a recent ad for Calsberg beer, run by Labatt Breweries of Canada, in which three women are shown discussing a boyfriend's willingness to perform a particular sexual act. These ads and many others rely on sexualkity to get consumers' attention.
* **Humorous Appeals**: Humorous ads can be an effective way to break through advertising clutter. But humor can be tricky. What is funny to one person may be offensive to another. Different cultures also have different senses of humor.

* * *

* **COMMUNICATION MIX** We've discussed integraiton as key to effective communication strategy. now let's look at the elements that marketers must coordinate in their IMC efforts. Within the marketing mix, the communication elements that that the marketer controls or influences are the communication mix. **These include advertising, sales promotions, public relations, direct marketing, personal selling, and word of mouth.** The term mix implies that a company's communication strategy is **focused on more than one element, so part of the challenge is to combine these different communication tools effectively**. Another challenge is to ensure that **the communication mix works in harmony with the overall marketing mix, which combines elements of communication with distribution, price, and product decision to position the firm's offering in people's minds. These other marketing mix elements, after all, also communicate.** A product design, for example, can send a powerful message: Honda Motor Company introduced to the japanese market a model called the City, which it deliberately designed to attract young drivers. The car featured a very high roof that made the City look like a toy. This playful quality appealed to japan's young consumers, and the design theme was reinforced by fun and carefree communication messages.
* **COMMUNICATION MIX ELEMENTS** Marketing communications can be categorized along two basic dimensions: the type of communication and the source.(table below #1) From customer's perspective, there are two types of communication. marketers are trying to deliver a message about their product or organization, or they are providing an incentive to purchase or otherwise change consumer behaviour. The customer identifies the source of these messages or incentives as either the organization or a presumed independent source, such as friends, magazine editorials, or expert opinion. There are also two main methods of transmitting messages and incentives--those that communicate to a mass audience and those that communicate person to person. This latter distinction is becoming blurred, however, as the Internet, smart checkout scanners, and interactive television enable what have traditionally been considered tools of mass media--advertising, sales promotion, and public relations--to be used to reach individual consumers with personal appeals. In this section, we'll briefly describe the elements of the communication mix, which are covered in more detail in Chapter 13. Some of the pros and cons of each element are also presented in Table (table #2)below.

                (Table #1)
                METHOD OF TRANSMISSION: Mass Media: 
                Identified as Marketer: advertising, sales promotion; 
                Not identified as Marketer: Public relations

                METHOD OF TRANSMISSION: Personal: 
                Identified as marketer: personal selling; 
                Not identified as marketer: word of mouth 

                (Table #2)

                Advertising: 
                Pro: The marketer has control over what the message will say, when it will appear, and who is likely to see it
                Cons: Often expensive to produce and distribute. 2. May have low credibility and/or be ignored by audience

                Sales promotion:
                Pro: Provides incentives to retailers to support one's products; build excitement for retailers and consumers; encourages immediate purchase and trial of new products; price-oriented prmotions cater to price-sensitive consumers
                Cons: Short-term emphasis on immediate sales rather than a focus on building brand loyalty; the number of competing promotions may make it hard to break through the promotional clutter

                Public relations
                Pros: Relative low cost; high credibility
                Cons: Lack of control over the message that is eventually transmitted, and no guarantee that the message will ever reach the target. Hard to track the results of publicity efforts

                Personal selling
                Pros: Direct contact with the customer gives the salesperson the opportunity to be flexible and modify the sales message to coincide with the customer's needs. The salesperson can get immediate feedback from the customer
                Cons: High cost per contact with customer. Difficult to ensure consistency of message when it is delivered by many different company representatives. The credibility of salespeople often depends on the quality of their company's image, which has been created by other promotion strategies

* **Advertising. For many, advertising is the most familiar and visible element of the communication mix. Advertising is non-personal communication from an identified sponsor using paid space, primarily in mass media. Because it can convey rich and dynamic images, such as the ones in the Olay Body Wash ad, advertising creates and reinforces a distinctive brand identity. **This helps marketers to both persuade customers to select their product and build bonds with buyers by presenting them with familiar brand images and logos time after time. Advertising is also useful in communicating factual information about the product or reminding consumers to buy their favourite brand. However, advertising sometimes suffer from a credibility problem, because cynical consumers tune out messages they think are biased or are intended to sell them something they don't need. It can also be very expensive for firms, so they must take great care to ensure their messages are effective.
* **Personal selling** The most personal way to communicate with consumers is by direct interaction, which can occur in person, by phone, or even over an interactive computer link. Personal selling occurs when a company representative comes in direct contact with a customer or group of customers to inform them about a product or service and to encourage them to make a purchase. This type of communication activity is most often seen in the busienss-to-business market, but everyone has experienced a door-to-door representative selling Girl Guide cookies or sales clerks in clothing stores asking if they can be of assistance. Salespeople are a valuable communication medium, because customers can ask questions and the salesperson can immediately address objection and relay product benefits.
* Personal selling can be tremendously effective, especially for big-ticket consumer items and for industrial products for which the "human touch" and developing tailored soltions is essential. It can be so effective that some marketers, if given a choice, might well abandon other forms of communication and simply dispatch a salesperson to every customer's house or office. Unfortunately, this form of communication is also the most expensive, and it can be difficult to ensure that all salespeople are delivering the same message with the same impact.
* **Direct Marketing**: Direct marketing was introduced in Chapter 11 as a form of non-store retailing. The tools of direct marketing--catalogues, direct mail, the Internet, and direct response television--also play a significatn communication role and are part of the communication mix. Some of these tools, such as the Internet and direct mail, are interactive: They can be customized to elicit measurable direct responses from individual customers and allow marketers to provide further customized information based on the response. Use of these interactive tools are called **interactive marketing**. The desired response is typically an order--a first-order response. **But other intermediate responses might be desired, such as a request for more information, agreeing to a sales demonstration, or providing feedback on a provided sample--second-order responses.** Coupon Radio, a car radio system that is now being tested, lets drivers request more information (e.g., about a band they hear on the radio, or to get names and addresses of retailers that sell an advertised product), all while cruising request to not receive any more information from the company. We assume that a priority of any communication campaign is to get more customers. **Interactive marketers sometimes operate with the opposite goal in mind: to reduce their customer base. They know that their efforts will be most effective when they are communicating only with customers who are interested in what they have to offer.**
* **Direct marketing typically focuses on short-term, single transaction responses or a set of responses leading to a purchase decision.** **Database marketing, as discussed earlier in the chapter, focuses on building ongoing relationships and brand loyalty over time. The secret to effective direct marketing is developing an effective customer database, which contains enough detail in its target market profiles about customer needs, wants, interests, preferences, purchase behaviour, consumption behaviour, and media habits to enable the marketer to tailor messages to very specific categories of consumers. In the case of direct mail, messages are often personalized, not only by using the consumers' name and address, but also by using personal information from the database in the content of the message**.
* **Public Relation** Public relation is a set of communication tools that organizations use to establish and maintain contact with the various publics (stakeholders) on whom their success depends. Public relations components of the communication mix seek to nurture a long-term positive relationship between the organization and its customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, shareholders, legislators, and other parties who affect or are affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives, and a positive image for the organization and its products in the long term. Public relations efforts are often associated with publicity--writing press releases and developing relationships with journalists who write stories or articles about an organization and its products. The communication results of publicity efforts are typically identified by consumers as being from an independent source.
* Public relations activities also include staging events, commissioning surveys of people's feelings about issues related to a product, signing and working with a celebrity spokeperson, and responding to product recalls or other crises. These are all activities that consumers identify with the organization. Tourism PEI, for example, recently used roving PEI ambassadors to tour New Brunswick tourist attractions in specially detailed cars (suggesting fun adventure) to entice Quebecers visting New Brunswick to come over to PEI during their holiday. This PR campaign was highly successful, but drew the wrath of New Brunswick tourism officials and government ministers.
* **Event marketing is a growing area of integrated marketing communication, as more and more firms use events as part of their communication mix. Events can often break through the clutter assoicated with some communication mix elements to deliver a clear and impactful brand message to consuemrs. For example, every year, Guinness Beer holds an event on Parliament Hill lobbying the government to make St. Patrick Days a national holiday. The event garners significatn media coverage for Guinness each year. Marketers at Guinness say that events such as this have contributed to a 20 percent sales increase for the brand. Events are an effective way to garner media attention and to allow consuemrs to interact directly with the brand.
* **Sales Promotion** **Sales promotions are programs, such as contests or store demonstrations, that marketers design t obuild interest in or encourage purchase of a product or service during a specified time period. Unlike other forms of communication that are message oriented, sales promotions are incentives, which are primarily intended to stimulate immediate action, such as coupons, rebates, or bonuses that might stimulate a purchase.** Increasingly, however, organizations such as airlines (e.g., Air Canada), grocery stores (e.g., Canada Safeway), and gas station (e.g., Petro-Canada) are using continuity or loyalty programs, which give discounts , bonuses, or redeemable "points" to members or frequent customers with the intention of building long-term loyalty to the organization. Sales promotions are a form of mass appeal, because they target groups of consumers or retailers to receive special offers or merchandise, **invite these people to particpate in some activity, or call attention to somme event or product feature.** 
* **The Internet and Other Element** The IMC concept suggests that marketers can use many other communication elements to communicate messages and incentives to customers--word-of-mouth communicatino, brand placement (such as in movies or on TV shows), third-party endorsements (such as Greenpeace recommending an environmentally friendly product), and third-party incentives (such as government subsidies for buying emergency preparedness kits). Marketers don't control third party endorsements or incentives, but they can influence the third parties through public relations and political lobbying. Chapter 13 discusses the growing area of Internet advertising in detail.
* **Buzz Appeals** In addition to the tried-and-true methods described above, many marketers are starting to figure out that they must find alternatives to traditional advertising--especially when talking to young consuemrs who are very cynical about the efforts of big corporations to buy their allegiance. For these and other "hard-to-get" consumers, marketers must find new "out-of-the-box" tactics. In addition, traditional advertising media are so saturated that marketers are scrambling to find new, unexpected places to place their messages. Some recent attempts include:

        * Nickelodeon is stamping images of SpongeBob Squarepants and Dora the Explorer onto packs of fruit.
        * US Airways is sellilng ad space on motion-sickness bags
        * A woman rented out her forehead on eBay; a casino paid $10000 to tattoo an ad there
        * CBS is advertising new shows on eggs, using a laser technology that etches images onto shells.

* These cutting-edge techniques come under a variety of names, including word-of-mouth marketing, viral marketing, and buzz and gurrilla marketing.
* **Buzz, Word-of-Mouth, and Viral marketing** Everywhere you turn in marketing today, it seems someone is talking aobut "buzz". In fact, we hear so much about buzz and its counter parts viral marketing and word-of-mouth marketing that it's hard to know exactly what all the terms mean. **The Word of Mouth Marketing Association**, founded in 2004, provides the following defintion

                * Word of mouth (WOM): The act of consumers providing information to other consuemrs
                * Word-of-mouth marketing: Giving people a reason to talk about your products and making it easier for that conversation to take place.
                * Buzz marketing: using high-profile entertainment or news to get people to talk about your brand.
                * Viral marketing: Creating entertaining or informative messages that are designed t obe passed along in an exponential fashion, often electronically, or by email

* In more general terms, marketers think of buzz as everyday people helping their marketing efforts by talking about a product or a company to their friends and neighbours. As the example of **table** below illustrate, companies today are spending moillions to create consumer buzz. Companies such as Dell have named word of mouth (WOM) marketing managers, and WOMMA membership boasts most of the top consuemr brand companies. According to advertising agency JWT Worldwide, over 85 percent of the top 1000 marketing firms now use some ofrm of word-of-mouth tactics.

                * General Mills: In the 1930 General Mills created the Betty Crocker character. When the Betty Crocker weekly radio show was aired, consumers spread the word. Betty Crocker still gets letters every day.
                * Burger King: As BK's website www.subservientchicken.com, consumers could have fun typing in orders for a man in a chicken suit to follow. The site attracted 418 million visitors who stayed on an average of 6 minutes. Result: Young people saw Burger King as a more empathetic and relevant company.
                * Nike: Nike was supposedly the "brain" behind a cool, illegal warehouse club in Berlin.
                * Hasbro: Consumers were encouraged to play Monopoly on t he streets of London. The fines and cleanup fees Hasbro paid to the city were far less than the advertising costs the company would have incurred in a traditional campaign.
                * Puma: The company encouraged consumers to stencil its cat logo all over Paris.
                * Audi: For the introduction of its A3 model, Audi staged a fake car heist at the New York Auto Show. Posters placed near the heist appealed to consuemrs for help and sent them to a webiste where they could participate in an alternate reality game (ARG) and find hidden clues to solve the mystery.
                * Kellogg's: The company gave a video of never-before-seen ads for Pop-Tarts to 12,000 "tween" girl influencers.
                * America's Next Top Model (television series): To promote the launch of its fourth season, the series used alloy.com, a webiste aimed at teen girls, to find 500 "insider" girls who could generate buzz about the show. Alloy monitors t he chat on its site and identified 7000 girls who had shown an interest in the show in their "chat". From the inital 7000, Alloy.com identified 500 who were the most popular on instant messaging buddy list. These 500 were given party kits and asked to invte four friends to their homes for gatherings themed around America's next Top Model.
                * Procter&Gamble: P&G sent product and information to 250,000 teens who were not paid but were free to form their won opinions and talk about the products
                * Microsoft: When introducing its new Halo 3 video game, Microsoft gave gamers identified as influencers bits of information about the game before its release so that they could talk about the product with other avid gamers who, conveniently, are also heavy users of chat rooms and video game message boards.


* Of course, buzz isn't really new. Many refer to the Mona Lisa as one of the first examples of buzz marketing. In 1911 the famous painting was stolen from the Louve and becam the topic of consumer talk around the globe, giving the previously little-recognized painting fame that exists until today. When you think of the effect of consumers talking one-on-one nearly a century ago, imagine the exponential increase in influence of the individual consumer "connector" or "e-fluentials" who use blogs and other computer-generated media to increase their reach. Compared to traditional advertising and public relation activities, these endorsements are far more credible and thus more valuable to the brand.
* Buzz works best when companies put unpaid consumers in charge of creating their own messages. As table shown below, WOMMA considers the hiring of actors to create buzz deceptive and unethical. This is just what Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication did when the company hired 60 actors to go to tourist attractions. Their role was to act like tourists and get unsuspecting passerby to take their photos using the new Sony Ericsson camera phone, and then hyp the phone. WOMMA now has rules that state that anyone talking up products should identify the client for whom they work. Some critics say buzz marketing should never be directed at children and teens, as these consuemrs are more impressionable and eaiser to deceive than adults.

                        Knowing disseminating false or misleding information

* Companies also must be careful using buzz marketing because campaign can backfire. This is what happended with McDonald's "Lincoln Fry" buzz campaign. The company used its blog to spread the word about a couple who found a McDonald's fry that looked like Abraham Lincoln. When consumers learned that the blog and the couple were bogus, the buzz turned negative. of course, marketers don't have a hand in creating all the buzz around a product. WOMMA refers to buzz resulting from buzz marketing compaigns as "amplified WOM", while it calls buzz that occurs naturally "organic WOM". Organic buzz allowed Procter&Gamble to discover that its Home Cafe coffee maker had a tendency to start fires after 3000 buzz agents complained. Naturally occurring buzz also can create negative publicity, as when ex-journalist Jeff jarvis detailed on a blog his problem getting a $1600 PC fixed due to poor service from Dell. To create postiive buzz, companies need to have a total customer focus, and to emphathize and care about their customers.
* **Guerrilla Marketing** A few years back, some companies with smaller advertising budgets developed innovative ways of getting consumers' attention. These activities--from putting advertising stickers on apples and heads of lettuce to placing product-related messages on the backs of theatre tickets and flags on a golf course--became known as **guerrilla marketing**. No, this term doesn't refer to marekters making monkey out of themselves (that's gorilla marketing). **A guerrillla marketing strategy involves "ambushing" consumers with promotional content in places where they are not expecting to encounter this kind of activity.
* Today, big companies are buying into guerrilla marketing strategy big time. Burger King recently began a guerrilla marketing campaign to increase sales in its Asia-Pacific stores by 25 percent. The company sent CD with quirky marketing suggestions to local restaurant managers. These included putting "I love BK" on T-shirts and placing the shifts on Ronald McDonald, placing large footprints from McDonald's stores to Burger King outlet, placing signs on empty benches saying "Gone to BK--Ronald", and placing large signs at BK location that are near KFC locations that read, "It's why the chicken crossed the road".
* **INFLUENCES ON THE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY, TACTICS, AND MIX** Some products need personal selling, whereas others are best sold in other ways. **Industrial goods and services, as well as big-ticket consuemr items, are more likely to have a greater emphasis on personal selling in their communication mix,** whereas it would be too costly for Colgate to hire door-to-door salespeople to promote its toothpaste. **many consumer products, such as cologne, tend to rely more on advertising, especially when the buyer selects the brand because of an image the manufacturer has carefully created for it.** Using consumer **sales promotion techniques such as coupons and premiums is very important to Procter&Gamble's sales of Tide detergent, but those same tactics would cheapen the image of Rolex or Mercedes.** **To compete for shoppers' attention, many companies allocate part of their communication efforts to in-store displays and even live product demonstrations to add the personal touch.**
* The communication mix must vary overy time, because some elements are better for accomplishing the marketer's objectives at different point in time than are others. As we saw in the Hunk cologne example, the stage of the product life cycle (see Chapter 8) influences the communication mix.
* In the introduction phase, **the objective is to build awareness of the product among consumers and to rely on a push strategy. Advertising is the primary communication tool for creating awareness, and a publicity campaign to generate news reports about the new product may help. At this stage, sales promotion can be used to encourage consumers to try a new product or service. Distributors are also often given incentives to stock the new item**
* In the growth phase, communication efforts must start to focus on **communicating specific product benefits. Advertising increases, whereas sales promotions that encourage trial often decline, because people are more willing to try the product without being offered an incentive.**
* The opposite pattern often occurs during the maturity phase in which many people have tried to used the product. **As sales stabilize, the goal is to persuade people to switch from a competitor's product, often when they see few important differences between competitors in a cateogy. Sales promotions, particularly coupons and special price deals increase--but sales promotion is not the only way to gain market share in a mature market.** Familiprix, a Quebec pharmacy chain, managed to increase sales by 23 percent and wareness from 19 percent to 52 percent in a mature market through a series of 15-second ads demonstrating, with humour, the positioning that Familiprix pharmacies are close by the understand health issues. The ads depicted common family health issues and a Familiprix pharmarcist jumping to the rescue exclaiming "Ah!Ha! familiprix!" The campaign becam such a pop-culture sensation that consumers, schoolchildren, and media personalities began adopting t he tag line in their conversations.
* All bets are off during the decline phase. **As sales plummet, the company dramatically reduces spending on all elements of the communication mix.** Sales will be driven by the continuted loyalty of a small group of users who keep the brand alive until it is sold to another company or discontinued as part of a harvesting strategy. The decline in sales further discourages the company from investing any more money in promoting the product, which may be left to wither on the vine. **Alternatively, the company may decide to try to revive the brand and dedicate a modest budget to restoring sales.**
* This was the case with Clorox Canada. Market research found  that by the late 1990s, the Glad garbage bag brand was timeworn. Clorox needed to revive its whole line of garbage bags and food protection products: It decided to go "retro" and revived a famous Canadian ad icon, the Man from Glad. Clorox took him out of the old suburban setting and placed him in the technical surroundings of a high-performance testing lab, where he watched technicians demonstrate the strength and dependability of Glad products to the slog "Glad. Depend on it". Canadians watched new Man from Gald television ads, read magazine ads, saw promotions in t heir local gorcery store, and responded very postiively. The re-emphasis on the Man from Glad has put Glad close to surpassing its main competitor to take over the top position in the disposable container category.

### Step 6: Determine and Allocate Budget
* While setting a budget for marketing communication might seem easy, in reality it's not that simple. Determining and allocate communication budgets involves determining the total communication budget and allocating how much to spend on specific promotion activities. Communication budgets do not determine communication strategy but communication budgets do inform strategy, in that marketers need to be aware of what can be achieved with a particular budget. The strategies and tactics used to commmunicate with a $50,000 budget, but the impact will be different as the $500,000 can buy more, and perhaps different, exposure to an audience. Table below shows examples of what different media cost for single placement (one ad, one time). Cost fall significantly when multiple placements are booked and most media sell packages of space, bundling attractive time slots with less attractive time slots at a discounted rate. However, as you can see from the "list" prices, communication is not inexpensive. knowing the approximate budget for a communicatino campaign helps marketers decide what communication mix elements can realistically be used.

* In an ideal world, setting the buget for communications would be simple: Spend whatever it takes to accomplish the stated objectives. In reality, firms often view communication costs as an expense rather than as an investment that will ead to greater profits. When sales are declining or the company is operating in a difficult economic environment, it is often tempting to cut costs by reducing spending on advertising, sales promotions, and other "soft" activities whose contributions to the bottom line are hard t oquantify. When this is the case, marketers must try to justify these expenses to others in the firm.
* Economic approaches to budgeting rely on marginal analysis (discussed in Chapter 9), in which the organization spends money on communications as long as the revenues realized by these efforts continue to exceed the costs of the communications themselves. **This perspective assumes that promotions are always intended solely to increase sales when, in fact, these activites may have other objectives, such as enhancing a firm's image. Also, the effects of communications often lag. For example, a firm may have to spend a lot on communications when it first launches a product without seeing any return on this investment for quite a while. Because of these limitations, most firms rely on two budgeting techniques: top down and bottom up.**
* **Top-down budgeting techniques** require top management to establish the overall amount that the organization wishes to devote to communication activities, and this amount is then divded among advertising, public relations, and other communication department.
* The most common top-down technique is the **percentage-of-sales method**, in which the communication beguet is based on last year's sales or on estimates for this year's sales. The percentage is an industry average provided by trade associations that collect objective information on behalf of member companies. The advantage of this method is that it reminds the organization that spending on communication does result in profits.
* Unfortunately, this method implies that sales cause communication outlays, rather than viewing sales as the outcome of commmunication efforts. As sales drop, firms might be reluctant to spend more on communication, when the drop might be due to environmental changes, such as a change in econom ic conditions or a rival's recent introduction of a new product. If so, cutting communication spending might not help the firm in the long run.
* The **competitive-parity** method is simply matching whatever competitors are spending. Some marketers think this approach is justified, saying that the decision simply mirrors the best thinking of others in the business. However, this method often results in each player maintain the same market share year after year. This method also assumes that the same dollars spent on communication by two different firms will yield the same result, but spending a lot of money doesn't guarantee a successful communication. Firms certainly need to monitor their competitors' communication activities, but they must combine this informaiton with their own objectives and abilities.
* The problem with top-down techniques is that budget decisions are based more on established practices than on communication objectives. Another appraoch is to begin at the beginning: **Identify communication goals and allocate enough money to accomplish them. That is what bottom-up bugeting techniques attempt**. For example, some marketers construct a *payout plan* that attempts to **predict the revenues and costs associated with a product over several years and matches communication expenditures to this pattern--spending more on communication in the first year to build market share, for example, and then less after the product catches on.**
* The bottom-up logic is at the heart of the **objective-task method**, which is gaining in popularity. using this approach, the firm first defines the specific communication goals it hopes to achieve, such as increasing by 20 percent the number of consumers who are aware of the brand. It then tries to determine what kind of communication efforts it will take to meet that goal. **Although this is the most rational approach, it is hard to implement, because it obliges managers to specifiy their objectives and attach dollar amounts to them. This method requires careful analysis and a bit of "guesstimating".**
* **ALLOCATE THE BUDGET TO A SPECIFIC COMMUNICATION MIX** Once the organization has decided how much to spend on communication, it must divide its budget among the elements in the commmunication mix. Although advertising used to get the lion's share of the commmunication budget, sales promotions are now playing a bigger role in marketing strategies. As MasterCard's vice-president of promotions observed, marketers who once relied on sales promotions solely to create a short-term response now see them as "a permanent, integral part of the brand". For example, although the typical NASCAR racing car is covered with the logos of tobacco and motor oil companies, other marketers such as HP, Universal Studios, and even banking giant HSBC are changing their communication mix by sponsoring racing teams. They are joining the race to capture the attention of the 460 million people who watch these events as they are broadcast to 201 countires. Several factors influence how companies divide up communication pie:

                * Organization factors: Characteristics of the speicifc firm influence how it allocates its money. These characteristics are the complexity and formality of the company's decision making process, preferences within the company for advertising versus sales promotions or other elements in the communication mix, past experiences with specific communication vehicles, as well as the "comfort level" of the firm's advertising and communication agencies with developing different kinds of marketing communication. Nestle, the giant Swiss company, for example, shifted about 20 percent of its advertising budget into sales promotion and direct-response efforts over a two-year period after the company determined that its communication dollars would be more effective there
                * **Market potential: Consumers in some markets will be more likely to buy the product. For example, the marketers of Hunk might find that men in blue-collar occupations would be more interested in the product than men in professional occupations. It makes sense for marketers to allocate more resources to television shows, radio stations, magazines, and other media or communication vehicles that also target people in blue-collar occupations.**
                * Market sizeL as a rule, larger markets are more expensive places in which to commmunicate. The costs of buying media (such as spots on local television) are higher in major metropolitan areas. But the sheer density of highly populated areas makes it easier to reach large numbers of consumers at the same time. Advertising is good for mass-market products, whereas personal selling is good for speicalized or highly technical products.

## Step 7: Implement Creative Strategy
* **Creative strategy** is the process that turns a concept into a communication piece or element. **It's one thing to know what a company wants to say about itself and its product, and quite another to figure out exactly how to say it.** The creative process has been described as the "spark between objective and execution". The Novell ad demonstrates how even business-to-business products, such as computer software and services, can come to life with the right creative strategy.
* **It is unlikely that one communication element can achieve all the communication objectives discussed previously, so marketers work in campaigns--a set of related elements that collectively deliver the objectives desire**. Each element in a campaign (a television ad, a newspaper ad, a brochure, etc.) typically has a different objective. **The goal of a campaign is to present a series of messages and repeat it to a sufficient degree that the audience will progress through the AIDA stages described earlier in this chapter. To do this, the creative team (art directors, mechanical artists, copywriters, photographer, and others) must develop a "big idea", a concept that expresses aspects of the product, service, or organization in a tangible, attention-getting, memorable manner. Then the concept must be executed in different media--such as print advertising, point-of-purchase materials, packaging, etc. Recognizing the concept of diffusion of innovation (Chapter 7), campagin elements need to be repeated--where the innovators may have acted already and tried a product, there will be many in the early and late majority who are not yet aware of a product.**
* **MEDIA SCHEDULING AND PLACEMENT** **Media planning is a problem solving process for getting a message to a target audience in the most effective fashion. The decision include audience selection and where, whe, and how frequent the exposure should be. There is no such thing as one perfect medium for marketing communications. The choice depends on the specific target audience, the objective of the message, and the budget. For the communication to be effective, the meida planner must match up the profile of the target market with that of speicfic media vehicles. For example, 80 percent of Chinese Canadian consumers in Vancouver read Chinese Canadian newspaper. Thus, a marketer trying to reach this segment might allocate a significant share of the communication budget to buying space in these newspapers**
* The media planner's first task in deciding where to place the communication is to find out when and where people in the target market are most likely to be exposed to the communication. This is the **aperture**, the best "window" t o reach that type of person. For example, many people who drive to work in the morning listen to the radio, so their aperture would include this medium at this time. Sun-Rype, for example, wanted to reach Moms with a message that its product "Fruit to Go" was nutritious (100 percent fruit) and reach kids with a message that these snacks were cool and tasty. Magazine ads, were chosen as the way to reach both audience. Seperately, with specific messages. Mom-targeted media included lifestyle and parenting magazines, while magazines distributed through schools, movie theatres, and direct to home were used to reach kids.
* **Media Choices** There are numerous paid and unpaid media outlets for communicating to audiences. Paid media such as television, radio, print, and outdoor media wil lbe discussed in Chapter 13--when we further discuss communication tactics.
* A company's website is becoming an increasingly important way to communicate interactively with consumers and support other forms of advertising. Kellogg Canada has set up several websites to support its advertising and communication goals for individual products. For example, the site for Kellogg's Special K cereal uses the slogan from its television and magazine ads, "look good on your own terms", and is designed for women, the cereal's primary target market. As users enter the site, they are shown an ad for Speical k before the webpage loads. Once on the site, visitors can see recipes using t he product, participate in chat rooms, or ask questions of fitness and nutrition experts. Through its webiste, Kellogg Canada is able to reinforce advertising activies in more traditional media and potentially reach new consumers with its ads and other promotional messages.
* **Media Scheduling: When to Say it** After choosing the advertising media, the planner then creates a **media schedule** that specifies the exact media to use, when, and how often the message should appear. Figure (that's not shown) shows a hypothetical media shcedule for the communication of a new video game. Note that much of the advertising reaches its target audience in the months just before Christmas, and that much of the expensive television budget is focused on advertising during specials just before the holiday season. The company's website is used in the media schedule as a constant reinforcement of the paid advertising placed in other media.
* The media schedule outlines the planner's best estimate of which media will be most effective in attaining the advertising objective(s), and which specific media vehicles will do the most effective job. **The media planner considers such factors as the match between the demographic and psychographic profile of a target audience and the people reached by a media vehicle, the communication activities of competitors, and the capability of a medium to convey the desired information adequately. The planner must also consider the compatibility of the product with editorial content: after all, vieweres might not respond well to a lighthearted ad for a new snack food during a sombre documentary on world hunger.**
* When analyzing media, the planner is interested in assessing **advertising exposure**, **the degree to which the target market will see an advertising message in a specific medium.** Media planners talk in terms of *impressions*, **which measure the number of people who will be exposed to a message placed in one or more media behicles. **For example, if one million people watch a miniseries on CTV, each time an advertiser runs an ad during that program, it receives one million impressions. If the tadvertiser's spot runs four t imes during the program, the impression count would be four million, even though some of these impressions would represent repeated exposure to the same viewers.
* To calculate the exposure a message will have if placed in a certain medium, planners consider two factors: reach and frequency. **Reach is the percentage of the target market that will be exposed to the media vehicle. This measure is particularly important for widely used products when it's important to get the message to as many consumers as possible.** Frequency is the number of times a person in the target group would be exposed to the message. This is important with products that are complex or are targeted to reletively small markets for which multiple exposures to the messages are necessary to make an impact.
* For example, say a media planner wants to get Club Med advertising to university and college students. The advertiser learns that 25 percent of that target market reads at least a few issues of Rolling Stone each year. The advertiser may also determine that these students are likely to see three of twelve monthly ads that Club Med will run in Rolling Stone during the year (frequency). Now, the planner calculates the magazine's **gross rating point (GRPS)** by multiplying reach times frequency, which in this case compares the effectiveness of Rolling Stone to alternativbe media. By using this same formula, the planner can then compare the GRP number of another magazine or the GRP of placing an ad on television or on a bus or any other advertising medium.
* Although some media vehicles deliver superior exposure, they may not be cost efficient. More people will see a commercial aired during the Stanley Cup playoffs than during 3:00am rerun of a horror movie. But the advertiser could run late-night commercials every night for a year for the cost of one 30-second Stanley Cup spot. For example, a 30-second ad on CBC that would be shown across the country could cost as little as $100 or as much as $46000, depending on when it was run. Similarly, a 30-second ad on TSN could be as little as $100 or as much as $20,000.
* To compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different media and of spots run on different vehicles in teh same medium, media planners use a measure called **cost per thousand (CPM)**. This figure compares the relative cost-effectiveness of different media vehicle that have different exposure rates and relfects the cost to deliver a message to 1000 people. For example, the cost for a Canadian comapny to do banner advertising on DoubleClick average $30 to $40 CPM. A medium's popularity with consumers determines how much advertisers must pay to put their message on it. Television networks are concerned with getting good ratings, because their advertising rates are determined by how many viewers their programming attracts. Similarly, magazines and newspapers try to boost circulation and websites to jsutify raising ad rates.
* **Media Scheduling: How Often to Say it** AFter deciding where to advertise, the planner must decide when and how often. What time of day? frequently for a few weeks, or occationally for a long time. After selecting the media schedule, the planner turns to the overall pattern the advertising will follow.
* A continuous schedule maintains a steady stream of advertising throughout the year. This is most appropriate for products that sell on a regular basis, such as shampoo or bread. Some advertising professional maintain that continuous advertising sustains market leadership even if total industry sales fall. On the downside, some message can suffer from advertising wearout, because people tune out the same old ad message.
* A *pulsing schedule* varies the amount of advertising throughout the year, based on when the product is likely to be in demand. S.C Johnson & Son, for example, uses a pulsing schedule to communicate its Off! brands of bug repellents more heavily in the summer months. *Flighting* is an extreme form of pulsing in which advertising appears in short, intense bursts alternating with periods of little to no activity. It can produce as much brand awareness as a steady does of advertising at a much lower cost, if the messages from the previous flight were noticed and made an impact.

### Step 8: Evaluate
* The final stage in developing a communication plan is to set criteria and methods to determine whether the plan is working. The marketer needs t o determine whether the communication objectives are adequately translated into marketing communications that are reaching the right target market.
* It would be nice if a marketing manager could simply report, "Our new $3 million communication campaign for our revolutionary glow in-the-dark surfboards resulted in $15 million in new sales!" Unfortunately, it is not so easy. Because there are many factors at work in the marketing environment, other events such as a manufacturing problem encountered by a rival board manufacturer, a coincidental photograph of a movie star riding one of the boards, or even renewed interested may have caused those new sales instead.
* A retail advertiser once complained: "I am certain that half the money I spend on advertising is completely wasted. The trouble is, I don't know which half." Despite this admonition, there ware ways to monitor and evaluate the company's communication efforts. The catch is that the effectiveness of some forms of communication is easier to determine than others. As a rule, sales promotions are the easiest to evalute because they occur during a fixed period of time and can be directly tied to sales.
* Direct measures of advertising effectiveness are difficult to design. It is hard to determine just how many sales were the result of a specific ad campaign. Advertising researchers measure brand awareness, recall of product benefits communicated through advertising, and even the image of the brand before and after an advertising campaign. **Post-testing** is conducting research on consumers' responses to advertising messages they have seen or heard (as opposed to pretesting, which collects reactions to messages before they're actually placed in "the real world") Ironically, many creative ads that are quirky or even bizarre make an advertising agency look good within the industry but are ultimately unsuccessful, **because they don't communicate what needs to be said about the product itself. As one consultant observed, "There is so much emphasis on the creative aspect of the ads, sort of "Aren't we clever?" that the message is lost.**
* In some cases, the ads are popular but they send the wrong message to consumers. For example, a lot of people remember Joe Isuzu, the lyting car salesman whose television commercials were popular for two years but were no help to Isuzu's car sales during that time. As one advertising executive explained, "the humor got in the way. All you remembered was that car sales men are dishonest, and the car salesman you remembered most was from Isuzu." **Three measures of the impact of an advertisement are unaided recall, aided recall, and attitudinal measures.** Unaided recall tests, by telephone survey or personal interview, how much of an ad a person remembers during a specific period of time, sometimes by asking the person to write down what the ad said. An aided recall test uses clues to prompt answers. For example, a researcher might show a group of consumers a list of brands and ask them to choose which items they have seen advertised within the past week. Attitudinal measures probe a bit more deeply by testing consumer beliefs or feelings about a product before and after being exposed to messages about it. if, for example, Dove antiperspirant's ads about the product being good for the skin make enough consumers believe that this is an important attribute for antiperspirants, marketers can consider the advertising campaign successful.
* Measuring the effectiveness of marketing communications is easier if the audience is requested to respond in some way--such as calling a 1800 number or going to a website. For example, in the Adobe ad, the company wants people to visit the "defytherules" site; if Adobe wanted to measure the effectiveness of the ad, it might use number of visits to the webiste advertised as one measure of this. Most often, however, advertisers research consumer response to advertising through post-testing. The effectiveness of banner advertising is even easier to measure, since the number of visitors coming to a website through a banner ad is directly measurable.
* A firm can analyze and compare t he performance of salespeople in different territories, though again it is often difficult to rule out other factors that make some sales force more effective than others. Public relations activities are perhaps the hardest to assess, because they often are intended to result in building favourable relationships over a long period of time.
* **EVALUATING INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS** The IMC perspective takes a broad view of the world: Learning about a good or service comes from many sources, and beliefs develop over time. For those reasons, traditional measurement techniques that focus on the impact of one message at one point in time are not adequate to assess the impact of an entire communication program. **Instead, marketers track consumer responses to communication efforts and interactions with the brand and/or company over time. They also conduct research to assess consumer attitudes toward the brand and/or  organization. Although they don't always accurately predict purchases, customers' attitude toward an item still are immportant pieces of information, especially when changes in attitudes are tracked over time. ideally these pieces of informaiton are collected on an ongoing basis and fed back into a database, where they will be used to update and refine the integrated strategy.**

## COMMUNICATION BRIEFS
* ***Communication plans are internal documents created by organizations that provided rationale for, and guide, their communication strategy for a specified period of time.*** **People in an in-house creative department or communication/advertising agency do not have time to read a lengthy communication plan. They rely on a communication brief, which is typically a one- to three-page summary of the elements of a communication plan that precedes creative execution--and for small projects it may replace the communication plan if the other elements of the plan are considered in the brief.** **The advantage of writing a formal communication brief, rather than just explaining the strategy for a campaign to the creative tieam, is that verbal explanations can be misinterpreted or modified in sequential telling within the creative team. If a lot of time is wasted in wrestling projects back on track (and at rates of $100 to $150 dollars an hour for each person in the room), it can be very expensive not having a clear understanding of the creative task. It is not easy capturing the essence of a 15- to 25 page communication plan in one- to three-page brief, but as one marketing executive suggested, "The creative has to be brief so the brief has to be creative". The idea is to set the strategic parameters in which the creative team operates and to gain agreement from the client that the brief represent the intended strategy. One retired president of a large new York agency described the brief as needing to be "as hard and brilliant as a diamond, and as tight and confining as a pair of handcuff." For example, the heart of t he creative brief for the now acclaimed Absolut Vodka campaign was "You can do anything you want creatively, but you must always show the product and no headline can be longer than two words and one of those words must be Absolut"

Marketing Concept: Discussing Choices and Issues
1. Increasingly, marketers are seeking new ways to communicate with consuemrs. Advertising is being placed on washroom walls, in high-school caferias, and and even in the halls of university and college classroom buildings. Develop debate arguments for and against this proliferation of commercial messages.
2. One reason to build a database is advance a political or social agenda by identifying and mobilizing a core of supporters. For example, Philllip Morris has built a database  with 25 million names, which the tobacco company uses to rally customers to the cause of smokers' rights. What are the ethical issues related to this use of databases.
3. Advertisers who spend millions of dolalrs for ads during special events such as the Olympics may be more interested in achieving aesthetic goals--having the most highly rated ad--than in selling products. Does it make sense for advertisers to focus on aesthetic goals rather than on marketing goals? Explain.
4. With an IMC program, firms need to coordinate all their marketing communication activities. What do you see as the problems inherent in implementing this?

### Chapter 13: Communications Mix and Tactics

## COMMUNICATIONS MIX REVISITED
*  In the previous chapter we discussed the range of decisions involved in developing a marketing communication strategy. In this chapter we revisit the communication mix to get **a deeper understanding of the tactical tools available** to marketers to get their messages in front of audiences. While advertising is often the most visible of communication mix elements, organizations that follow an IMC strategy recognize that other elements can be highly effective--and that is the choice facing Mario Demers at Saputo Dairy Products Canada. Microcell Solutions, for example, supports its fido (cellular phone system) brand's communications strategy with a strong public relations program, sales promotion, and personal selling. In the greater Toronto area, Microcell's objective was to increase awareness and trial of Fido and leverage the emotional relevancy of the brand to reach customers one-to-one. The company linked a variety of experiences--key messages, images, sounds, and activities--to the brand under the theme "Fun & Freedom". It launched the campaign with a "fido mobile", a vintage 1942 bus pulled by a dozen dogs, which attracted significant media attention. Fun & Freedom events were held throughout greater Toronto--augmented by free photographing of prospective customers and their pets, having dogs perform tricks to demonstrate Fido's features and benefits, and allowing prospective customers to make free calls anywhere in Fido's coverage area. Fido also chose to involve Canine Vision Canada in the campaign, because both Fido and guide dogs represent freedom to their masters. Advertising supported the public relations efforts by visually linking Fido to fun and freedom imagery, such as sunglasses, beach balls, and fireworks. Sales promotions, including a grand prize sweepstakes and at-event contests for T-shirts, baseball caps, Fido phones, and airtime packages, futher enhanced the overall strategy. The campaign was successful in making the Fido brand personally relevant to thousands of pet owners. Having a better understanding of these communication mix elements will allow you to make more informed communication mix decisions.

### ADVERTISING
* Wherever we turn, we are bombarded by ads in the form of television commercials, radio spots, banner ads on the Internet urging us to "click here", or huge billboards screeaming "Buy Me!" As indicated in the previous chapter, advertising is non-personal communication paid for by an identified sponsor using mass media to persuade or inform an audience. Advertising is the most common element of a communication mix because it can be fun to crete, glamorous to be involved with, and often involves large budgets, travel, and celebrities. it gives a marketing manager or executive something tangible that says "I helped create that" inspiring, magical, humourous, provocative, or otherwise creative piece of art. Be honest, wouldn't you rather spend $200,000 of someone else' money creating a television ad with Shania Twain or Justin Timberlake than developing a coupon or hiring another sales rep? Of course, actually creating the television ad can be time consuming, heavily detail-oriented, and boring (such as waiting for the paint on the set to dry or taking five or six hours of retakes to shoot a three-second scene), but overall, advertising attracts a lot of a communication budget because it is fun to do.
* Of course, advertising is also very effective. Advertising is often unparalleled in its ability to demonstrate products **(particularly services)**, use sights and sounds to crete desire, and repeat the message as often as deemed necessary for it to have an impact on receiveers. IAdvertising is such a big part of our culture that it both reflects and shapes our culture, and it is so effective that there are laws limiting its use for vulnerable audiences like children and the promotion of social undesirable products like cigarettes. And that's also why Canadian busienss spend close to $12.6 billion a year on advertising.
* We talked about the planning that goes behind the creation of advertising in Chapter 12. Here we will discuss how to create effective advertising and how to evaluate or critique its effectiveness.

### Creating Advertising
* A poor strategy or poor exeuction can result in annoying, boring, or otherwise ineffective advertising. you know, the ones you flip the TV channel to avoid watching or the ones you don't even look at when reading your favorite magazine. 
* When people give examples of effective advertising, they are likely to recall the provocative poses in Calvin Klein ads, the charming dialogue between Frank and Gordon, or vomiting Playland customers--advertising that was memorable because it stood out and uniquely appealed to its intended audience. These are all examples of **product advertising**, in which the message focuses on a specific good or service. Product advertising usually has one of three purposes: **to educate audience to try it or choose it over other options, or to ensure that people won't forget about the product and the things they already know about it.** **Institutional advertising** **promotes the activities, personality, or point of view of an organization or company. Another use of institutional advertising is to build demand for a product category, such as the Canadian egg producers' ads that encourage consumers to "Get Cracking".**
* Some institutional messages state a firm's position on an issue in order to sway public opinion, a strategy called advocacy advertising. For example, the R.J Reynolds company ran an ad titled "Of Cigarettes and Science", which attempted to refute arguments about the relationship between smoking and health. **Public service advertising (PSA)** are advertisements the media runs free of or to champion an issue such as increasing literacy or discouraging drunk driving. The ad created by Toronto ad agency Downtown partners was first produced for the Red Cross and World First Aid Day. The ad tries to convince Canadians to learn first aid and CPR--the tag line is "know what to do. Learn First Aid". often advertising agencies will take on one or more public service campaign on a pro bono basis (for free)
* **WHO CREATES ADVERTISING?** An **advertising campaign** is a coordinated, comprehensive plan  that carries out promotion objectives and results in a series of advertisements placed in media over a period of time. For example, the long-running advertising campaign for Buckley's Mixture--"it tastes awful. And it works"--**has included both print advertising and a series of humourous television commercials that all work together to build brand loyalty for the cough medicine. i nfact, the Buckley's campaign is considered one of the most effective in Canadian advertising history. The brand is the number-one selling cough syrup in Canada, even though it spends far less on advertising every year ($458,600) than its closest competitor, Robitussin DM ($1.7 million)
* Creating and executing an advertising campaign ofte nrequires many companies working together and a broad range of skilled people to do the job right. Some firms may do their own advertising by creating an *in-house agency*. In many cases, though, the firm retains one or more outside advertising agencies to develop advertising messages on its behalf. A *limited-service agency* provides one or more speicalized services, such as **media buying or creative development** (we'll see what these tasks are later). A *full-service agency* provides most or all of the services needed to moun a campaign, including research, creation of ad copy and art, media selection, and production of the final messages. in keeping with the move to integrated communication strategies discussed in Chapter 12, most Canadian advertising agencies have transformed themselves into full-service *communication service companies*, which provide clients with advice and service in all areas of communications decision making, including advertising. Many different tasks are required to produce an advertising campaign. Big or small, an advertising agency or communications services company joins the talents of speicalists who together craft a message and make the communications concept a reality.
* **Account management** The account executive, or account manager or suit, **is the "soul" of the operation** **The person develops the campaign's strategy for the client. The account executive supervises the day-to-day activities on the account, and is the primary liaison between the agency and the client. The account executive has to ensure that the client is happy while verifying that people within the agency are executing the desired strategy.
* **Creative services**: Creatives are the "heart" of the communciation effort. These are the people who actually dream up and produce the ads. They include the agency's creative director, copywriter, and art director. Creatives are the artists who breathe life into marketing objectives and craft messages that (hopefully) will excite, arouse, or interest consumers.
* **Research and marketing Services**: Researchers are the "brain" of the campaign. They collect and analyze information that will help account executives develop a sensible strategy. They assist creatives in getting consumer reactions to different versions of ads, or by providing copywriters with details on the target group.
* **Media Planning** The media planner is the "leg" of the campaign. The media planner helps to determine which communications vehicles are the most effective and recommends the most efficient means for delivering the ad by deciding where, when, and how often it will appear.

### Media Choices
* What does a 130-centimetre television with Dolby Surround Sound have in common with a matchbook? Each is a media behicle that permits an advertiser to communciate with a potential customer. Depending on the intended message, each medium has its advantages and disadvantages. let's look at the major categories of media. The pros and cons of each type are summarized at table below.

                Television
                        Pros: 
                        *Extremely creative and flexible
                        * Network TV is the most cost-effective way to reach a mass audience
                        * Cable and satelite TV allow the advertiser to reach a selected group at relatively low cost
                        * A prestigious way to advertise
                        * Can demonstrate product in use
                        * Can provide entertainment and generate excitement
                        * Messages have high impact because of the use of sight and sound

                        Cons:
                        * The message is quickly forgotten unless it is repeated often
                        * The audience is increasingly fragmented
                        * Although the relative cost of reaching the audience is low, prices are still high on an absolute basis--often too high for smaller companies. A 30-second spot on a prime-time TV sitcom costs well over $250,000
                        * Feweer people are viewing network television
                        * People switch from station to station zapping commercials
                        * Rising costs have led to more and shorter das, causing more clutter.
                
                Radio:
                        Pros: 
                        * Good for selectively targeting an audience
                        * Is heard out of the home
                        * Can reach customers on a personal and intimate level
                        * Can use local personalities
                        * Relatively low cost, both for producing a spot and for running it repeatedly
                        * Because of short lead time, radio ads can be modified quickyl to reflect changes in the marketplace
                        * Use of sound effects and music allows listeners to use their imagination to create a vivid scene
                        
                        Cons: 
                        * Listeners often don't pay full attention to what they hear
                        * Difficulty in buying radio time, especially for national advertisers
                        * Not appropriate for products that must be seen or demonstrated to be appreciated
                        * The small audience of individual stations means ads must be placed with many different stations and must be repeated frequently
                
                Newspaper:
                        Pros:
                        * Wide exposure provides extensive market coverage
                        * Flexible format permits the use of colour, different size ads, and targeted editions
                        * Ability to use detailed copy
                        * Allow local retailers to be in with national advertisers
                        * people are in the right mental frame to process advertisements about new products, sales, etc
                        * Timeliness. i.e., short lead time between placing ad and having it run

                        Cons: 
                        * Most people don't spend must time reading the newspaper
                        * Readership is especially low among teens and young adults
                        * Short life span--people rarely look at a newspaper more than once

#### Traditional media
* Television: Because of television's ability to reach so many people at once, this medium is a favourite choice for regional or national companies. Ninety-nine percent of Canadian live in households that have a TV, and 65 percent of Canadians live in households with more than one TV. On an average day, 86 percent of Canadians watch TV at least once. There are two English (CBC and CTV) and two French (Radio-Canada and TVA) national television network in Canada, which can offer both regional and national advertising exposure. There are 18 regional networks, three of which are in French. Yet another option for TV advertising is specialty channels, which provide a specific programming format (The Comedy network) or audience (Women's Television network) and can, therefore, provide easy access to a particular market segment. In 2007, 36 percent of homes in Canada reported that they subscribed to pay TV.
* One disadvantage of advertising on television is cost. In addition to the cost of placing ads in media, production costs range from $80,000 to $250,000 for a 30second television ad. This high cost of production has led some companies to consider advertising on TV without using commercials. Product placement is a method of advertising on television (and in movies), where the product is seen as part of the TV show (or movie) rather than in a separate ad. Recent product placements in Canada TV shows include Nortel phones used on the Newsroom, Ruffles Chips on Degrassi: The Next Generation, Rona building products used in the Quebec home renovation show Ma Maison Rona, and Sony Ericsson phones being used on Train 48. **MMI Product Placement**, the largest product placement company in Canada, claims that the advantages of product placement include image reinforcement when a 'star" uses the product, brand awareness, extensive reach (during reruns as well as during first runs), and the protection of the product from zapping (since consuemrs often use zapping to avoid ads, not TV shows)
* Radio: One advantage of radio advertising is flexibility. Marketers can change commercials quickly, often on the spot by an announcer and a recording engineer. Radio is attractive to advertisers seeking low cost and the ability to reach specific consumer segments. There are hundreds of radio stations in Canada, with formats ranging from contemporary hit to classical. The growth of online radio also presents future opportunities for reaching large numbers of consumers in a cost-effective manner. Radio reaches 92 percent of Canadians 12 years old and older in an average week. While we have seen a sligh decline in radio listenership among teens and young adults, weekly multi-media campaign, TD Canada Trust used radio to help luanch a promotion to give away five applicances to 61 winners across the country. A ballot to enter the contest was given out with each eligible application for a home equity line of credit or a mortgage. TD Canada Trust radio to cost-effectively reach customers across the country.
* Satellite arrived in Canada in late 2005. There are currently two major players selling satellite in Canada--Sirius Canada and XM Radio. Satellite radio is commercial free and is supported through subscriber fees. Although some industry expoerts expected satellite radio to take market share from traditional radio, since its launch, satellite radio has had little measurable impact on traditional radio.
* Newspaper: The newspaper is one of the oldest media vehicles. Retailers in particular have relied on newspaper ads since before the turn of the century to inform readers about sales and deliveries of new merchandiser. Newspapers are an excellent medium for local advertising and for events (such as sales) that require a quick response. Many newspapers, such as The Globe and Mail and the National Post, offer online versions of their papers to expand their exposure.
* Magazine: Magazine ads provide high-quality images and can reach specific segments of consuemrs. new technologies such as selective binding allow publishers to personalize their editions so that advertisements for local businesses can be include in issues mailed to specific locations. **Desktop publishing** software allows magazines to close their pages just before going to press--no more long lead times that used to plague advertisers that wanted to hit their market with timely information.
* **Directories** **Directory advertising is the most "down-to-earth", information-focused advertising medium.** Today, the Yellow Pages has revenues of over $9.5 billion, and more than 6000 directories are published in North America alone. **These listings are usually referneces used just before the consumer makes the decisions to buy, so the advertiser has the opportunity to influence the buyer immediately before the decision**
* **INTERNET ADVERTISING** The web gives marketers the ability to reach customers in new and excting ways. Online advertising has grown to over $801 million a year in Canada, with major firms like General Mills, Inc. and Kraft Foods increasing their spending and the number of brands they promote online. The reason? The Internet had the third highest media consumption time among Canadian adults--just behind television and radio. Sixteen percent of the time Canadian consuemrs spend with all media is now online. online advertising offers several advantages. First, the Internet provides new ways to finely target customers. Web user registration and cookies allow sites to track user preferences and deliver ads based on previous internet behavaiour. In addition, because the website can track how many times an ad is "clicked", advertisers can meausre how people are responding to online messages. Finally, online advertising can be interactive--it lets consumers participate in the advertising campaign, and in some cases they can even become part of teh action. Viewers who logged on to a special website were able to "direct" TV commercials for the Ford Probe by pciking the cast and plotlines that would be used to create actual spots. Similarly, during its "whatever.com" campaign, Nike sent consumers to the web to pick the endings of three cliffhanger TV spots.
* Specific forms of Internet advertising include banners, buttons, popup ads, search engines and directories, and email

                * Banners: Banners are rectangular graphics at the top or bottom of webpages
                * Buttons: Buttons are small banner-type advertisements that a company can place anywhere on a page.
                * Search engine and directory listings: jsut as the yellow pages and other directories are advertising media, so too are search engines and online directory listings. Who have you Googled today? In Canada 35 percent of online advertising revenue comes from search engine advertising.
                * Popup ads: A popup ad is an advertisement that appears on the screen while a webpage is being loaded or after it has loaded.
                * Email: For advertising, email is becoming a pervasive as radio and television. it is one of the easiest ways of communicating with consumers because marketers can send unsolicited email advertising messages to thousands of users by spamming--sending unsolicited email to five or more people not personally known to the sender. many websites that offer email give surfers the opportunity to refuse unsolicited email via junk email blockers. This permission-based marketing gives the consumer the pwoer to opt in or out. marketers in the United States send about 200 billion email to consuemrs every year, so they hope that a good portion of these will be opened and read rather than being sent straight to the recycle bin.

* Search Engine Marketing: Search engines like Google are the primary destination for people wanting to find things on the internet. Getting your website to show up in search engines is one of the most important things you can do in online marketing. The process of increasing a website's performance in search engines is known as search engine marketing, or SEM. The top three search engine, Google, Yahoo, and MSN, account for most fo the Internet serach traffic, with Google alone accounting for over half of the World's Internet search. Therefore, when we talk about SEM, it is usually easiest just to talk about increasing a website's performance in Google. Google provides a full range of good SEM tools, and most of the concepts transfer to any search engine.
* Search engine use complex algorithm to sort through billions of webpages on the Internet. They send out robot known as "spiders" that crawl through the web reading information and storing their findings in the search engine's database. users then go to the search engine and enter a search term, called a query. The search engine then delivers a long list of websites it think are somehow realted to the query. The page these results are shown on are called search engine resuls pages or **SERP**, and the position of a result in the SERP's is called a rank. Website owners can pay to have their website show up in the "paid" or "sponsored" results section, which can be found along the right-hand side or top of Google's SERPs. The main list of results, known as "organic" or "natural" results, appears down the left of the SERPs. It is most desirable to have your site appear in the organic results section because these links are free and generally atract more clicks than paid results.
* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) A typical serach in Google will return hundreds of millions of results, but all that really matter are the first 10 to 50. Once your site has been indexed, the real challenge becomes battleing your way to the top of the organic results. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving a website's rank in organic search engine results.
* Using techniques that legitimately improve a site's search engine visibility through website design or content improvements is known as White Hat SEO. Using tricks solely for the purpose of boosting organic search ranking is known as Black Hat SEO, and can result in a website being banned from search engines like Google. Black Hat techniques include things like making text the same colour as the background so that it is invisble to user but still appear in the website's code. Some Black Hat techniques can get your site t o the top of the results quickly, but once you get labelled as a search engine spammer it can be tough toever get back into the top 50.
* When you're optimizing your site for search engines, it may help to consider the four Rs of SEO: 

                * Readability: Can search engines find and read your website
                * Relevance: Based on a given query, what are the chances the searcher is looking for information on a page in your website
                * Reliability: How credible is your website

* **MOBILE MEDIA** In this age of the Internet, it seems as if we jsut get used to a dozen or so new terms when they are replaced by an equal number of new ones. M-commerce is new buzzword that many marketers are talking about. The "m" stands for mobile. M-commerce is the promotional and other e-commmerce activities transmitted over mobile phone and otehr mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs)
* M-commerce had made its way to Canada and the United States. Even the MTV Music Video Awards now include a wireless advertising campaign to promote the event. Millions of consumers who use such networks as Telus, Bell Mobility, Palm, and OmniSky will get messages urging them to tune in.
* What's the big attraction? Canadians have embraced wireless phones; these devices have become one of the fastest growing consumer products in Canada. In 2007, 74 percent of 18-34-year-olds in Canada had access to a wireless device. This is up dramatically from 45 percent in 2000. While young people in particular are big users of wireless devices, the number of Canadians with access to a wireless device has grown in all age categories, with 72 percent of 35-54-year-olds and 48 percent of adults aged 55 and older having access to a wireless device.
* More and more companies are using cellphones as another way to reach consumers with advertising. This technique, known as short-messaging system marketing (SMS), is becoming increasingly popular in Canada. Lancome recently ran a national text messsage marketing campaign for its new line of eye makeup, Color Design. The campaign targets consumers 18 to 35 years old. Ads were placed in women's washrooms in restaurants and bards, inviting consumers to text message "Color" to a six-digit code. They then received an instant message with a toll-free number to call to book a free Lancome Eye Design makeup session at the Bay. Consumers then received a second message reminding them of their makeup session. At the appointment they received a Color Design eye shadow, worth $19.
* Mcdonald's used SMS marketing to encourage consumers to try its new deli sandwich. The promotion was centred on the World Ski and Snowboard Festival in Whistler, British Columbia. Signage around the event invited users to "Text in to get toasted". After consumers sent the text as directed, the message they got back was "Congratulation, you've won a coupon for a free deli sandwich", with instructions to visit the on-site McDonald's kiosk for a coupon that could be redeemed there, or later at another restaurant. More than 7000 samples of Toasted Deli Sandwiches were distributed during the weekend event. McDonald's sales in Whistler rose by 38 percent overall, with an average increase in Toasted Deli Sandwich sales of 12 percent. The campaign was a success.
* M-commerce messages can reach specific types of consumers. A campaign for readers of Men's Health magazine sent a customized daily menu via cellphone to help interested readers curb calories. So what are the advantages of m-commerce to consumers? First, m-commerce provides incredible consumer convenience. You can use your mobile phone to buy tickets for a concert without standing in line. You can even buy soft drinks from a vending machine through the phone--a service already available in Europe.
* But the potential for m-commerce is even greater. Perhaps you're in the market for a new computer. You visit a local retailer and decide what you want. While you're there, you use your mobile phone or PDA to check prices of the same computer on the Internet. If you decide you have the best price, you'll be able to handle the transaction on your phone as well, paying for the computer through a secure Internet connection.
* For marketers the opportunities for m-commerce are even more exciting. Using sohpisticated location-based technologies including satellites, a retailer will be able to know when you are only a few blocks away from her store and she can send you messages about a special sale. And as you pass McDonald's your phone will beep to remind you how great a Big Mac combo would taste right about now. Of course, such opportunities bring a whole host of privacy issues that msut be settled before these scenarios can become a reality.
* In the past, SMS campaigns were typically one way--once the mobile campaign was over, advertisers ended the mobile relationship. Advertisers are now starting to see the benefits of an ongoing relationship with customers who have, in effect, inititated a relationship when they texted a code to the advertiser. Molson, for instance, deploys SMS campaigns at most major events where it is a sponsor. The "Canadian Rocks" campaign, for example, enticed audiences at the Molson Amphithreatre in Toronto with the opportunity to upgrade their seats to the "best seats in the house". All that consumers had to do was type the Molson short code and a specific keyword promoted at the event into their cell to be notified just before the headliner hit the stage. Molson continued the relationship by sending a text to all users who responded to the promotion asking them if they'd like to receive ongoing information about music and join the Molson "Insider" program, which provides them with special insider benefits. Molson has enjoyed an opt-in rate of 15-30 percent with this SMS program--very impressive.
* One study predicts that despite the slow start, about 90 million North Americans will be participating in m-commerce by 2007, generating more than $50 billion in revenues. That's opportunity calling.
* **OUT-OF-HOME MEDIA** Out-of-home media such as blimps, transit ads, and billboards reach people in public places. This medium works best when it tells a simple, stragihtforward story.
* Marketers are constantly searching for new ways to get their messages
