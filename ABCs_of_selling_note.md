* Selling is about helping others and caring about others.
* marketing mix includes product, price, place and promotion. Besides the marketing mix, you should also consider whether there is a need for your goods and services


* Questions you need to answer:

                **
                * Which product attributes are important in this decision--price, quality, service
                * Of these attributes, which are most important?
                * What are the prospect's attitudes toward your products?
                * What are the prospect's attitudes toward your competitor's products?
                * Which level of satisfaction is expected from buying the product.
                **


* You can help the buyer be satisfied with the product and lower the level of dissonance in several ways. **First, if necessary, show the buyer how to use the product properly. Second, be realisitic in making claims for the product. Exaggerated claims may create dissatisfaction. Third, continually reinforce buyers' decisions by reminding them how well the product actually performs and fulfill their needs. Remember, in some situations buyer can return the product to the seller after purchase. This cancels your sale and hurts your chances of making future sales to this customer. Fourth, follow up after the sale to determine if a problem exists. If so, help correct it. This is a great way to increase the likelihood of repeat business.**

## To Buy or Not to Buy--A Choice Decision
* Salespeople realize that people buy a product because of a need, and that need can be complex due to the influence of perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and personality. Furthermore, perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs may differ from one purchase to another. How is it possible to state why people buy one product and not another?
* Salespeople do not have to be psychologists to understand human behavior. Nor do they need to understand the material covered in courses taken by a psychology major. Furthermore, the average salesperson can not know all that is involved in the psychological and practical processes that a buyer goes through in making a decision.
* What the salesperson does need to understand are the various factors that can influence the buying decision, the fact that buyers actually examine various factors that influence these decisions, that buyers actually go through various steps in making decisions, and how to develop a sales presentation that persuades buyers to purchase the product to satisfy needs. To do this, the salesperson should consider the following questions before developing a sales presentation.

                * What type of product is desired?
                * What type of buying situation is it?
                * How will the product be used?
                * Who is involved in the buying decision?
                * What practical factors may influence the buyer's decision?
                * What psychological factors may influence the buyer's decision?
                * What are the buyer's important buying needs?

* Again, it seems necessary to know a great deal about a person's attitudes and beliefs to answer these questions. Can this be made simpler? Yes. Simply state, to buy or not to buy is a choice decision. The person's choice takes one or two forms: First, a person has the choice of buying a product or not. Second, the choice can be between competing products. The question salespeople should ask themselves is, "How can I convince a person to choose my product?" The answer to this question involves five things; each is necessary to make the sale. People will buy if:

                1. They perceive a need or problem
                2. They desire to fulfill a need or solve a problem
                3. They decide there is a high probability that your product will fulfill their needs or solve their problems better t han your competitor's products.
                4. They believe they should buy from you.
                5. They have the resources and authority to buy.

* What do you do if you know your product can reduce a prospect's manufacturing costs, saving the firm 5,000 a year, for a cost of 4,000 and the prospect says, "No thanks, I like my present equipment?" This buyer does not perceive a need, and will not buy. Suppose you make your point about reducing operating costs, but for some reason the prospect seems uninterested in reducing costs. Chances are, this person will not buy no matter how persuasively you present your product's benefits--because the prospect does not see high costs as an important problem.
* Furthermore, even customers who want to solve a problem, but do not like your product, will not buy. But if you have convinced them, if they watn to solve a problem, and if they perceive your product as solving this problem, the question remains, Will these customer buy from you? They will, if they believe you represent the best supplier. If they would rather buy from another supplier, you have lost the sale. Your job is to provide the necessary information so that customers meet each of the five conditions for a sale listed above.
