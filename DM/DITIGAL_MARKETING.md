# Preface
Digital marketing is dead...long live digital marketin!
* I love this business. I love its engergy, passion and soundbyes too, just like the one above.
* Digital attracts some of the brightest minds and ideas and sometimes attracts people desperately seeking a sensationalist headline (just like the one above!)
* Last week at an industry event I heard that not only had digital marketing well and truly snuffed it but in fact advertising was dead too. A miserable facts, figures, infographics... not forgetting seminars, webinars, events with cool acronyms--and then of course there are sites, apps, channels, clips, magazines, the gurus, the white papers, PowerPoints and shares, likes, comments, emoticons, tweets and retweets...it's a noisy old world.
* And yes it is flawed but it's still alive and...
* Anything that evolves and moves like lightning has already set off a few speed cameras. No omelette was ever made without breaking a few eggs and digital is no stranger to this fact, but it's showing no signs of slowing down... shedding its immortal coil, well not yet anyway.
* Since the last time I sat down to work on this book (about two years ago) the digital marketing world has changed. It has become more scientific and taken several leaps forward, particularly with programmatic and mobile. But the audience has changed too--in fact I feel that the audience is now more elusive than ever. Sure it's a bigger audience and we can all run around waving stats, but there is a fundamental difference: while advertisers and technologists battle on with new formats, new tools and fab ways of measuring stuff, the consumer has been ignored.
* The desire for digital marketing has, in my opinion, forsaken the fundamental objective of digital marketing...to engage our digital generation in an appropriate, mutally agreeable and profitable manner, whereby the consumer feels loved and has received value for money and value for their time.
* This IS the marketplace. If you are an agency or brand and are not prepared to subscribe to this objective, well then, it's not digital marketing that is dead, it's you my friend.
* Is it any wonder that adblocking has become such a major issue for publishers and brands? Is it any surprise that marketers struggle to maintain audience and engener loyalty? The consumers have been left out of the conversation for too long and it will now start to show.
* But under no illusion...digital marketing is not dead...BAD digital marketing is dead and bad digital marketers and their bad agencies are dead too.
* Disrespecting privacy, irritating consumers and making the mistake of copying what you do online with what you do offline is dead.
* Being intrusive, awkward, inconsistent with crappy online forms that don't scroll down properly and archaic interfaces that wouldn't know UX if it bit them in the BX... you're dead too!
* Simply put, if your friends spoke to you the way some digital marketers speak to you then you would probably punch them in the face or leave them waiting outside in the rain...
* If marketers want to be part of this brave, new and exciting landscape then we have to get our act together and start being more inclusive and emphatic toward the interests of consumers--marketers in the coming years will be judged on the experience they provide for their customers. We used to talk about the four Ps of marketin...price, place, promotion and product. E Jerome McCarthy, the originators of the four Ps, sadly passed away a few months ago. He wasn't wrong about the four Ps--it is just what we knew and understood at that time.
* I have rewritten the four Ps to apply to our current generation of stakeholders. Please consider the 10 Ps.

1. PERFORMANCE: how is your activity measured against objectives and against competitors? The internet has shrunk the world but mammothed the available number of service and product providers. How you perform in relation to digital engagement consigns you to success or failure.
2. PRESENCE: how is yours? Online, mobile, search engines, social media? Are you there? Do you look good? Is it working?
3. PLEASURE: how do your customers rate their user and customer experience with you versus your competitors? Who does this better than anyone? If you know that answer then BE LIKE THEM...do not settle for second best.
4. PROXIMITY: are you there when your customers need you? Are you on hand 24/7? This generation wants it all and wants it now.
5. PERTINENT: are you relevant? Are your marketing and outreach relevant to their needs at this time? Do you know? Well if you don't then go and find out--ask them , they won't bite!
6. PROCESS: how is this working out for your customers... how you engage is one thing but the actual process of delivery and payment (another P?) is not to be overlooked.
7. PERSONAL: not sure why I just thought of this but I fly to Dublin every 10 days or so and there's a guy on passport control who checks my passport and says, "Thanks, Damian'. It makes me smile and I like him. That is what we need online--not Mrs Ryan and Dear Sir..when used in the right way, personalization is very powerful
8. PREFERENCES: and if your customers don't want to go too personal then provide them with preferences so you can all learn and all get the best from your relationship.
9. PROFIT: weirdly this was not part of the original four Ps but it should have been. Everything you do should be measureable and return on investment (ROI) is often a crucial part of this measurement.
10. PEOPLE: ones and zeros are all very useful but let's not forget we are dealing with people--ignore this at your peril!

* The past, the current, and the future are and always have been about the customer. Never lose sight of that fact. Regardless of technology, competition, media... now is the time to engage with customers on their terms, to listen and show that you love them- and if digital media can help to achieve that then digital marketing is very much alive and well.
* In the pages that follow I take you on a journey into the world of digital marketing. I will show you how it all started, how it got to where it is today, and where thought leaders in the industry believe it is heading in the future. Most importantly of all, I'll show you-in a practical, no-nonsense way--how you can harness the burgeoning power of digital media to engage with consumers and drive your business to the crest of this digital marketing wave, and how to keep it there.
* This book will:

* help you and your business to understand that digital marketing is all about people--the customers that your business relies on for success and the people in your team who are responsible for engaging and delighting these customers by understanding that the new currency is EXPERIENCE;
* help you and your business to choose online advertising and marketing channels that will get your ideas, products and services to a massive and ever-expanding market;
* give you that elusive competitive edge that will keep you ahead of the pack; digital marketing and the trends that are shaping its future;
* give you a concept of the scale of the online marketplace, the unfolding opportunies and the digital service providers who will help your business to capitalize on them;
* provide practical, real-world examples of digital marketing successes--including leading brands that have become household names in a relatively short space of time;
* offer insight thorugh interviews, analysis and contributions from digital marketing experts;
* ... ultimately, give you the tools you need to harness the power of the internet in order to take your business wherever you want it to go.

* As you travel in to this digital world the book will reveal how leading marketers in sectors as diverse as travel, retail, gambling and adult entertainment have stumbled on incredbily effective techniques to turn people on to doing business online, reaping literally millions as a result. The book will show you how to apply their experience to transform your own digital enterprise.
* Whether you are looking to start up your own home-based internet business, work for a large multinational or are anywhere in between, if you want to connect with your customers today and into the future, you need digital channels as part of your marketing mix.
* The internet has become the medium of choice for a generation of consumers: the first generation to have grown up taking for granted instant access to digital information. This generation integrates digital media into every facet of its daily life, in ways we could never have conceived in even the recent past. Today this generation of digital natives is entering the workplace and is spending like never before. This is the mass market of tomorrow, and for business people and marketers the challenge is to become fluent in new digital language so that we can talk effectively to our target audience.
* Television froze a generation of consumers to the couch for years, now digital media is engaging consumers and
