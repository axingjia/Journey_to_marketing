# Chapter 1: The Social Media Environment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
* When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. What are social media? How are social media similar to, yet different from, traditional media?
2. How does the Social Media Value Chain explain the relationships among the Internet, social media channels, social software, and the Internet-enabled devices we use for access and participation?
3. What are the major zones of social media that make up the channels, modes, and vehicles for social media participation?
4. What is social media marketing? What marketing objectives can organizations meet when they incorporate social media in their marketing mix?

## IT's A SOCIAL WORLD
* When you woke up this morning, what was the first thing you did? Sure, you may have taken a moment to gulp down some juice or coffee, but odds are you also checked your mobile for texts that came in overnight. Maybe you set you Snapchat Story. Perhaps you scrolled through a few tweets or checked WhatsApp. You certainly aren't along: one survey of people from 31 countries reported 96% of them use their smartphone within an hour of waking up, often before they get out of bed.
* Face it--you're a digital native. If you're a typical student, you probably can't recall a time when the Internet was just a static, one-way platform that transmitted text and a few sketchy images. The term digital native originated in a 2001 article by Marc Prensky (2001) titled "Digital natives, digital immigrants." He tried to explain a new type of student who was starting to enter educational institutions. These students--students like you--were born in an era in which digital technology has always existed. You and your fellow digital natives grew up "wired" in a highly networked, always-on world. It's an exciting time--but it continues to change so constantly that we need to study it carefully.
* Today the Internet is the backbone of our society. Widespread access to connected devices like personal computers, digital video and audio recorders, webcams, smartphones, and wearables like smartwatches ensures that consumers who live in virtually any part of the world can create and share content. Worldwide, there are about 4.38 billion global Internet users today--that's roughly 57% of the world's population. Most Internet users, about 45% of the world's population, are active on at least one social network. That's about 3.5 billion people. Of course, social media penetration does vary by global region, with the lowest penetration rates reported in Central Asia, Africa, and South Asia. Even these areas are expected to experience growth, at least in part due to Internet access via mobile phone. Mobile penetration is 67% worldwide and 63% of mobile users are active on social media via mobile applications. Curious about social media usage in a specific country? We Are Social, a global social media marketing agency, provides data on every country in the world in its Digital Yearbook. Odds are you already participate in this wired world.
* Information doesn't just flow from big companies or governments down to the rest of us; today each of us communicates with huge numbers of people by a click on a keypad, so information flows across people as well. The fundamental change in the way we live, work, and play is characterized in part by the prevalence of social media. **Social media are the online means of communication, conveyance, collaboration, and cultivation among interconnected and interdependent networks of people, communities, and organizations enhanced by technological capabilities and mobility.** Does that sound like a complex definition? It is...because social media exist within a complex and rapidly advancing environment. We'll dive deep into the social media environment, but first let's explore the making of a social media life--your life.

## LIVING A SOCIAL (MEDIA) LIFE
* The Internet and its related technologies make what we know today as social media possible and prevalent. Every day the influence of social media expands as more people join online communities. The average Internet user has accounts within eight different social media services and spend more than two hours a day on social media. Facebook, a social utility that offers synchronous interactions (which occur in real time, such as when you text back and forth with a friend) and asynchronous interactions (which don't require all participants to respond immediately, such as when you email a friend and get an answer the next day), content sharing of images, video, music, games, applications, groups, and more, has at the time of writing more than 2.2 billion active users worldwide. What's more--more than 1 billion of those users are mobile users. If Facebook were a country, it would be the most populated in the world. Do you wonder why Facebook is called a social utility? A community that got its start as a social network, Facebook offers functionality far beyond basic relationship building. It not only competes with social channels ranging from video and photo sharing to blogs; its Facebook Live, Marketplace, and Campaign ensure it competes with e-commerce sites, news sources, and other advertising media channels. Facebook also owns the top two social messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messanger, as well as the top photo- and video- sharing network, Instagram.
* people aren't just joining social communities. They are contributing, too! Let's take Youtube as an example. Youtube users (Youtube has around 2 billion users) upload more than 300 hours of video every single minute of every day. That's roughly equivalent to 1,500,000 full-length movies uploaded weekly. Youtube hosts local versions in more than 100 countries and users can navigate Youtube in 80 different langues. It's perhaps not surprising then to learn that Youtube users watch more than a billion hours of video each day (and more tahn half watch on mobile devices). Google the phrase "social media stats" and you'll see mind-boggling facts and figures about the number of people who use social media, what they're doing (and when) with social media, and their reach and influence. This has been done for you in Table 1.1. And take a look at Figure 1.1 an infographic that highlights fun facts about some of the most popular social sites.

        Table 1.1: Mind-Boggling Social Media Stats
        * It took radio 38 years to reach 50 million listeners. TV took 13 years to reach 50 million users. The Internet took 4 years to reach 50 million people. In less than 9 months, Facebook added 100 million users
        * Just over 13% of Facebook users are in North America; more than a third of users are in the Asia Pacific region
        * More than 90% of companies use Linkedin as their primary recruiting tool
        * The top Youtuber, like PewDiePie and Lily Singh, earn millions of dollars each year
        * Generation X (ages 35-49) spend the most time on social media--6 hours and 58 minutes per week. Millennials (age 18-34) come in second, spending 6 hours and 19 minutes of their time per week on social networks
        * Two-thirds of Internet users worldwide use social media
        * While Facebook dominates in size and penetration worldwide, Instagram dominates in user engagement. Brands see a median engagement of 0.09% per Facebook post, in comparison of 1.60% median engagement rate per post on Instagram 
        * QQ, Webchat, and Qzone, social networks with heavy user bases in Asia, are more popular than Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest

* When we introduce the definition of social media earlier, we admitted it's a complicated idea. It's difficult to fully capture the realm of social media because of the expansive nature of sites, services, and behaviours that are a part of this rapidly expanding digital universe. There are simply too many social websites, too many things we can do online, and increasing access using a variety of devices to grasp it all at once.
* More generally, however, we can think of social media as the way digital natives live a social life. To sum thigns up, it's all about a culture of participation; a belief in democracy; the ability to freely interact with other people, companies, and organizations; open access to venues that allow users to share content, fromm simple comment to reviews, ratings, photos, stories, and more; and the powr to build on the content of others from your own unique point of view. Here's just a brief look at some of the things you might do with social media:

* Share and document an event using live video.
* Watch television while discussing the program on social media.
* Create a blog to share your favorite recipes
* Coordinate a book club meeting and negotiate a group discount on the book's purchase price
* Mobilize a group of people to protest against an unpopular policy on your campus
* Instant message or voice chat with friends to carry on a synchronous conversation online.
* Share an infographic with your friends.
* Locate the best vegan restaurant in a city you're visting for the first time based upon reviews by other vegans
* Make your own animated video and share it
* Keep a travel diary of a trip abroad complete with photos , videos, journal entries, and destination ratings.
* Raise money for a charity or even find backers for a startup company who are willing to fund part of your costs.
* Find people you use to know and reconnect with them.
* Entertain yourself and your friends with short social games

* The list could go on and on. Our point? Social media enable active participation in the form of communicating, creating, joining, collaborating, working, sharing, socializing, playing, buying, and selling, and learning within interactive and interdependent networks. Thus, social media are interactive and participartory. It's an exciting time to be around!
* While social media users have embraced social media, its infrastructure has developed in ways that have made social media pervasive and ubiquitous. Social media intersects with websites, platforms, and media devices. The result is that people today live in what can be thought of as an omnisocial world.

## THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
* The environment of social media is like a volcano that suddenly erupts within warning. Within a few short years we've seen an ever-expanding domin of activities, channels, technologies, and devices that are changing how we think about our lives (e.g., in the old days a "friend" was someone you actually knew in person!) As a student of social media marketing, recognizing the parameters of the field and how the pieces of the puzzle fit together will benefit you as you develop skill as devising social media strategies and tactics. The Social media Value Chain, shown in Figure 1.2, organizes this complex environment into its core components.

        Figure 1.2
        * Infrastructure
        * Channels/Hosts
        * Supporting Software and Services
        * Devices
        * Share-Create-Talk-Work-Buy/Sell-Learn

* The value chain illustrates the core activites of social media participants and the components that make those activities possible. As a social media user, you are empowered to participate in any way you'd like, from just "lurking" on a site to scripting, filming, and uploading your own video stories. Those activities are made possible by the underlying infrastructure of social media's techno-social system. just as in the physical world where we need infrastructure in the form of roads, railroads, TV transmitters, and trained people to operate and maintain these structures, in digital environments the pieces that make up the social web are crucial. These include the web, the social channels and vehicles, the software that provides the programming we need in order to carry out these activites, the device (iPad, smartphones, computers) we use, and of course the parcipants--the people and organizations whose contribution porvide the content we all access. Let's take a closer look at each of these elements.

## THE WEB AS PLATFORM
* Just as the Internet is a foundation for the web, the web is the foundation for social media. Because social media are not possible without this infrastructure, it is the first supporting component we identify in the Social Media Value Chain. To put it simply, the Internet is a network of connected data servers. Initially, th web (what we now call Web 1.0) was a network of connected information. People browsing the Internet were merely consumers of the Internet's most static contents. Web 1.0 was the era of cognition, in which a network of data producers served information to primarily passive consumers. Web 2.0 marked a major shift by connecting networks of people in addition to networks of information. Tim O'Reilly (2005), founder of O'Reilly media and the first to define Web 2.0 explained Web 2.0 as "development in online technoology that **enable interactive capabilities in an environment characterized by user control, freedom, and dialogue."** Web 2.0 offered a cost-effective solution that provides access to rich data; the collective wisdom of its users, access to micromarkets; software that operates on multiple platforms (mobile phone, personal digital assistant, computer) and beyond (cloud computing); and user interaces that are easy, accessbile, and interactive.
* From these advances blossomed the "social web" and an era of communication, in which networks of networked communities have members who participate as consumers, creators, and co-creators. Each additional user adds value for all users. Economists refer to this as a **network effect**. Amazon's ability to recommend books to you based upon what other people with similar interests bought in the past gets better as it tracks more and more people who enter search queries and make purchases. When you're visiting a new city and want to find a great restaurant on Yelp, you feel more comfortable with a place that 1000 diners recommend than one that only ten users rate. You get more value from Facebook as more of your friends also use the network. Network effects enable organizations to leverage the value of **crowdsourcing**, a process that harnesses the collective knowledge of a large group of people to solve problems and complete tasks. Organizations use crowdsourcing to benefit from the collective wisdom of crowds, but the network effect ensures that there is sufficient participation for the crowdsourced solution to be a good one.
* Web 3.0, the **Semantic Web**, is the expected next stage. First envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, this iteration of the web makes it possible for people and machines to collaborate. The web will be a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange. It will mark an era of collaboration--not only of people, but also of people and machine. In other words, devices (yes, machines) will be contextually, socially, and network aware and be able to dynamically create social connections between each other and connected people in order to offer services to each other and to jointly solve problems. In other words, social media will eventually serve to support **collective intelligence**. while some elements of Web 3.0 exist--especially the presence of services made possible by social software, the capture of user-generated data, and the mining and processing of the data--it is not yet fully realized. We remain in a stage known as Web 2.x.

## SOCIAL CHANNELS
* Social channels are the networks and platforms that support social media functionality and connections. We cover these in the section of the Zones of Social Media

## SOCIAL SOFTWARE
* So far we've learned that the social media environment supports many activities. But much of our experiences and what we are able to create or do online is due to a host of **social software** applications. These are computer programs that enable users to interact, create, and share data online. For virtually everything you'd like to do online, there is a social software program (or several) that can help you. **Interested in planning an event? Use an event planner and invitation service like eVite.com.** Want to keep a notebook of wedding ideas that you can share with your bridesmaids? use Evernote.com, or create a board of hot new wedding gown styles on Pinterest (watch out for those hideous bridemaids' dresses). Need to keep a new feed of all the latest happenings at your school? Use Paper.li or Google Alerts. Want to create an e-book to share on Linkedin? Use Designerr. Social software can facilitate interation, content creation, sharing, syndicating, saving, analyzing, filtering, sorting, and searching data online. Such tools are certainly useful to individuals, communities, entrepreneurs, and businesses. Examples include mixir (for producing live radio shows and podcasts), Xtranormal (for video production), and Prezi (for presentation).
* You've heard of the phrase "There's an app for that!" It's no wonder given that there are currently more than 1.2 billion apps available through digital stores like Google Play. Those apps, also known as widgets (usually downloadable or embeddable), are types of social software. In addtion to apps, social software also encompasses application service sites that we call social services. Importantly, social sofware exist to facilitate all social media channels. There are applications for social community activities, publishing, entertainment, and commerce. Importantly, these apps largely enable mobile connectivity to our social spaces and activities. Blurring things further, open application programming interface (APIs) and other platform technologies have enabled countless third-party websites to integrate with social network sites. A more recent development is the chatbot, an artificial intelligence computer software program that simulates intelligent conversation via written or spoken text using a chat interface, such as Facebook Messanger or Webchat. Chatbot can provide a number of conversational services ranging from functional to fun.
* Social software also operates behind the scenes in ways that affect your social media experience. Social sites use complex mathematical formulas called algorithms to personalize the content you see in your news feed, recommend friends connections, and more. Dominique Cardon, author of What Are Algorithm Dreaming of? likens algorithms to a recipe in that they are a series of instructions that produce a desired result. When you browse nearby restaurants on your phone, view movie recommendations on Netflix, or check Youtube on how-to videos, algorithms likely played a role in the outcome.

## DEVICE
* Devices are pieces of equipment we use to access the Internet and the range of activities in which we participate online. We utilize connected hardware devices like tablet PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, Internet-connected game consoles, traditional laptops and desktops, and even televisions for social media access. As a consumer, we may focus primarily on connected devices like smartphones and other smart devices, especially those that provide mobile access to social media. Globally, 93.4% of social media users participate using a mobile device. Today's smart devices also include refrigerators, thermostats, and even cars. Wearables are smart devices that can be carried or worn on one's body. They measure and capture data, which can then be stored, shared, and further processed. Fitness wearbles like Fitbit, which measure activity levels and share the information with online communities, have experienced the most adoption thus far, but they represent a small portion of wearable devices. For instance, Snapchat Spectators, camera-equipped sunglasses, enable users to take video and upload it to Snapchat with the touch of a button.
* Even devices that aren't "smart" on their own can become so by using an Internet of Things gateway. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a paradigm in which all the object around us could be connected anytime and anywhere. Gateways are devices that can facilitate connection for objects without network capabilities. So far most applications are industrial, but expect to see consumer applications in surprising areas. Absolut, the vodka company, is experimenting with manufacturing its bottles as IoT-enabled objects! Smart devices are a first step in the evolution toward connecting machines as users, alongside people in social media. Ultimately, social connection among machines will transform them from passive data-collecting devices into active members of a thriving digital ecosystem, capable of creating social connections, solving problems, and offering services.

## PEOPLE
* Social media work only when people participate, create, and share content. Journalists, editors, and publishers still matter in social media, but so do every day individuals. You see this visualized in Figure 1.2 as a series of activities typical in social media participation. This is why we hear so much about citizen journalists (amateurs who post about newsworthy events) and citizen advertisers (people who share their iews about a product or service even though they're not affiliated with the company). Bloggers represent a unique hybrid form of "netizens" in that they may create and share content professionally or personally. Publishing a blog is surely a bigger commitment to sharing content than is posting a status update to your Facebook wall, but both actions generate content and add value to the social media environment. Still, people aren't the only actors in social media. As a techno-social system, other participants include businesses and brands, government organizations, community groups, media companies, content producers, and so on.
* Our coverage of the Social media Value Chain isn't complete without a review of social channels and related vehicles in and through which social media participation takes place. We address these channels, known as the zones of social media, next.

## CHANNELS: THE ZONES OF SOCIAL MEDIA
* The word media has multiple meanings, but for our purposes we'll simply use it to refer to means of communication. The media we use range from ass media (means of communication that can reach a large number of individuals) such as broadcast, print, and digital channels, to personal media (channels capable of two-way communication on a small scale) such as email, surface mail, telephone, and face-to-face conversations. Social media cross the boundaries of mass and personal media, so they enable individual to communicate with one or a few people as well as to thousands or even millions of others.
* Communication travels using a medium (or channel) such as **word of mouth, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, signage, Internet, direct mail, or telephone**. Within each medium, marketers can choose specific **vehicles** to place a message. For example, within the medium of television, marketers may choose Stranger Things as one vehicle to broadcast their message. Cosmopolitan and Fast cmopany are vehicles for the magazine medium. Social media are socially enabled online channels, and like other media, there are numerous vehicles within each channel.
* Part of the comlexity of social media is due to the sheer quantity of channels and vehicles, with new ones coming online all the time. These options are easier to compare and contrast if we group similar channels together. In so doing we can conveniently organize the social media space into a compact space that consists of what we call the four zones of social media. Figure 1.3 illustrates the four zones of social media channels, and we've organized the book around these groupings:

        * Zone 1 is Social Community: Sharing, socializing, conversing
        * Zone 2 is social publishing: Editorial, Commercial, User-Generated
        * Zone 3 is Social Entertainment: Games, Music, Art
        * Zone 4 is Social Commerce: CRM/Service, Retailing/Sales, Human Resources

* You'll note, as we discuss various uses of social media for personal and commercial purposes, that some areas overlap two or even more zones. That's the fluid nature of social media. All social media are networked around relationships, technologically enabled, and based on the principles of shared participation. The four zones framework isn't set in stone for this reason--but it is a very useful way to cut through the clutter and focus upon the most important functions of each social media platform--including those that haven't been invented yet.

## ZONE 1: SOCIAL COMMUNITY
* Social commmunities describe channels of social media that focus upon relationships and the common activities people participate in with others who share the same interest or identification. Thus, social communities feature two-way and multi-way communication, conversation, collaboration, and the sharing of experience and resources. **All social media channels are built around networked relationships, but for social communities the interaction and collaboration for relationship building and maintenance are the primary reasons people engage in these actiivities.** Many of the channels in which you already participate likely reside in this first zone. The channels in the social community zone include social network sites, message boards and forums, and wikis. All emphasize individual contributions in the context of a community, communication and conversation, and collaboration.
* Social network sites (SNS) are online hosts that enable site members to construct and maintain profiles, identify other members with whom they are connected, and participate by consuming producing, and/or interacting with content provided by their connecctions. Profile picture enhance the ability of members to develop a **social identity** when they add a prfoile picture or avatar, basic information about themselves, and other customizable options. Members maintain a **social presence** in the community that may indicate their availability, mood, friend list, and status. **Connections**, whom we might call *friends, followers, or fans,* communicate and share content in a vareity of ways, including direct messages (akin to email within the social network site), wall posts (post to a profile, visble to others), and chat or instant messaging (IM) options. Thus, SNS offer both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communication, and the resulting content may be either permanent or temporary. Snapchat's popularity is largely attributed to its disappearing messages. SNS add value to users by offering and/or enabling applications. Facebook offers thousands of apps, ranging from games to dating to weather forecasts to safety check-ins. Though the services provided by app functionalities heighten user engagement, the focus of SNS is on the individual communication and collaboration within the context of connections in the community. We'll delve deeper into these characteristics and uses of SNS and social communities in Chapter 6.
* Given the dominance of Facebook and other major players, it's easer to assume that there are only a small number of social networks. In fact, there are hundreds of SNS vehicles. But are you familiar with Steemit, DriveTribe, Whisper, Houzz, or Thumb? SNS exist to meet the needs of their users and many provide niche communities.
* **Forum** are perhaps the oldest venue of social media. Essentially, they are interactive, online versions of community bulletin boards. They focus entirely on discussions among members. Members establish profiles as they do in SNS and participate by posing content including questions, opinions, news, and photos. Others then respond and extend conversation as they post responses; this results in a threaded discussion. There are thousands upon thousands of forums active online, most oriented around a common interest. For example, RC Universe (www.rcuniverse.com) is a vibrant community of remote-control hobbyists.
* **Wikis** are collaborative online workspaces that enable community members to contribute to the creation of a useful and shared resource. Wikis can be about anything and everything. A wiki could be created by a family community to share and update family history, or by an appliance manufacturer that is trying to develop the perfect user manual. The software that supports the wiki enables multiple members to collaborate, edit, make comments, and share a variety of content.

## ZONE 2: SOCIAL PUBLISHING
* **Social publishing** is the production and issuance of content for distribution via social publishing sites. Social publishing sites aid in the dissemination of content to an audience by hosting content while also enabling audience participation and sharing. While social networks met the need for online communities, social publishing made it possible for people to share their content, user-generated content (UGC), without the barriers and gatekeeping of traditional publishing and broadcast models. It is a key reason we associate social media with democracy in that social publishing democratized content production and dissemination. That said, today, individual users are not the only social publishers. Professional content creators like journalists, traditional media organizations like newspapers, and brands develop content for and publish on social publishing sites. We categorize social publisers into four use group: 1) individual users, 2) independent professionals, 3) professional contributors associated with organizations such as news media, and 4) brands. Brand use social publishing as a distribution and/or promotion mode in **content marketing** campaign. (Content Marketing Institute)
* The channels of social publishing that we will feature in Chapter 7 include blogs, microsharing sites, media-sharing sites, and social bookmarking, and news sites. Social publishing channels enable participation and sharing, just as social communities do. The distnction between these two zones is in the primary orientation. **The orientation of social communities is networking, while that of social publishing is knowledge-sharing.**
* **Blogs** are websites that host regularly updated online content; they may include text, graphics, audio, and video. Blogs may be maintained by individuals, journalists, traditional media providers, or organizations, so they feature a wide range of topics. Thus, there are blogs that operate much like an online news source or magazine, a tabloid, or simply as an online personal diary. Blogs are social because they offer social share tools, and they are participatory because they include option for readers to leave comments that can result in threaded discussions related to specific posts. Several services are available for formatting and hosting, including Blogger, Wordpress, Squarespace and Weebly.
* **Microsharing sites**, also called microblogging sites, work much like blogs except that there is a limit to the length of the content you can post. A **microshare** could include a sentence, sentence fragment, embedded video, or link to content residing on another site. Twitter, the most well-known microsharing vehicle, limits post to 140 characters. Others include Plurk and Parler.
* **Media-sharing sites**, like blogs, host content but also typically feature video, audio (music and podcasts), photos, and presentation and documents rather than text or a mix of media. Media-sharing sites host content searchable by the masses, but within each vehicle are options for following content posted by specific people. Thus, media-sharing sites are also networked. Here are some prominent vehicles within different types of media

        * Blogging: Tumblr, Blogger, Wordpress
        * Video Sharing: YouTube, Vimeo, and Vsnap
        * Photo sharing: Flickr, Snapfish, and Instagram
        * Music and audio sharing: Audiofarm, and Soundcloud
        * Presentations and documents: Scribd, SlideShare, SplashCast, BrightTalk, and SlideBoom.
        * Social bookmarking services (i.e., sharing links to other sites): Diigo and Digg

## ZONE 3: SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT
* The zone of **social entertainment** encompasses events, performances, and activities designed to provide the audience with pleasure and enjoyment, experienced and shared using social media. The distinction between the zones of social publishing and social entertainment is the orientation: knowledge-sharing versus entertainment-sharing. The topic of Chapter 8, these include social games, social music, video and social television. The social media channels supporting this zone include communities dedicated to entertainment like Spotify and TikTok, as well as multi-zone social networks like Youtube and Instagram. At this stage in the development of social media, **social games** constitute by a substantious margin the most advanced channel in the social entertainment zone. These are hosted online and include opportunities for interaction with members of a player's network as well as the ability to **statuscast** (post updates to one's status) activities and gaming accomplishments to online profiles. Examples of social game vehicles include Candy Crush and Mafia Wars.

## ZONE 4: SOCIAL COMMERCE
* Our fourth zone is **social commerce**. The topic of Chapter 9, social commerce refers to the use of social media in the online shopping, buying, and selling of products and services. Social commerce encompasses social shopping, social marketplaces, and hybrid channels and tools that enable shared participation in a buying decision. Thus, social commerce enables people, both networks of buyers and sellers, to participate actively in the marketing and selling of products and services in online marketplaces and communities. **social shopping** is the active participation and influence of others on a consumer's decision-making process, typically in the form of opinions, recommendations, and experiences shared via social media. Channels include reviews and ratings (or review sites like Yelp or branded e-commerce sites), **deal sites** (like Groupon), **deal aggregators** (aggregate deals into personalized deal feeds), **social shopping markets** (online malls featuring user-recommended products, reviews, and the ability to communicate with friends while shopping like Wanelo), **social storefronts** (online retail stores that sometimes operate within a social site like Facebook with social capabilities), community marketplaces (peer-to-peer sites like Etsy), and social networks with sales conversion functionality. In addition, organizations can socially enable aspects of their traditional e-commerce websites by using tools such as **Facebook Connect** (a Facebook tool that allows users to log in to other partnering sites using their Facebook identities) and **share applications** (tools that let users share what they are buying). Figure 1.4 illustrates the four zones of social media along with several vehicles prevalent in each zone at this time.

        * Social Community: Twitter, facebook, linkedin, reddit, instagram
        * Social publishing: Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress, Medium, Youtube, SmugMug, SlideShare, Scribd
        * Social Commerce: Facebook, Shopify, Groupon, Etsy, VideoGenie, TripAdvisor, Payvment
        * Social Entertainment: Come2Play, Spotify, DevianArt, youtube, mySpace, Zynga, uGame

        MY:
        * Social community: Reddit, 
        * Social publishing: linkedin, medium, Youtube
        * Social commerce: Facebook,
        * Social Entertainment: Youtube

## MONETIZATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA
* As wired individuals, we've come to rely on many of the social sites and services and available online. And for marketers, social media have created one of the most exciting and efficient opportunities to reach target audiences. But have you ever thought about how those social sites earn revenue? Most sites still feature free access and a buffet of valuable tools and services. Yet those organizations have invested in potentially extensive development costs and time, hosting costs, and ongoing maintenance. Though it's standard business practice to invest capital to pave the way for future profitability, how do these organizations earn revenue if many of  the platforms are free to use?

### BUSINESS MODELS AND MONETIZATION
* Just like other businesses, social media providers (whether they are social communities, utilities, software providers, or game and app developers) need a **monetization strategy**. **Monetization** refers to how a business earns revenue. It must make money if it is to survive. if a system requires substantial new investment as users adopt it, the break-even point for return on investment (ROI) is delayed even as it appears to be a success. This plan is part of a company's overall **business model**--the strategy and format it follows to earn money and provide value to its stakeholders. For example, Google derives most of the revenue from its widely used search engine (where you "google" a term to locate relevant online links) from the fees it charges advertisers to put their messages on the results pages. In contrast, eBay makes most of its money by taking a cut of the proceeds each time a seller fulfills an order from a buyer on its merchandse pages. Two different business models, both ways to return value to the sponsoring organization.
* For decades now, media providers (e.g., the big networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox) and media conglomerates (e.g, Disney, Viacom, and Time Warner) have relied heavily on a business model we call the **interruption-disruption model**. The goal is to create programming that is interesting enough  to attract people to watch it or listen to it. Then, when they have your attention, they interrupt the programming to bring you a commercial message. They sell ad space to marketers who want to gain the attention of a targeted audience, and the audience allows this to happen in return for access to programming they want. The monetization strategy relies upon attracting as many people as possible to the content; the more who pay attention (or who at least tune in even though they may not be paying attention), the more the programmer can charge for the right to insert messages in that vehicle.
* Many social media sites still use this same strategy of earning revenues from selling ad space (Did you notice the text ads delivered alongside your Facebook news feed today?). Though some companies have other revenue stream (or source of income), typically through subscriptions to premium versions or fees for data, these are unlikely to replace the model of "adspace as revenue". Despite the value of services and content found online, the culture of the web is one of open and free access..
* Because social media are built on participation, and the more content, the better, people's contributions also have value. Should you have to pay for online content? Believe it or not, way back in the old days (i.e., before 1999) it never occured to consumers that they should not pay for content. That's when a college student named Shawn Fanning introduced the Napster site that enabled music lovers to share tracks for free. That party lasted only two years before legalities caught up with the service, but by then the cat was out of the bag. Now, many people (not to point fingers, but especially college students) believe that "information wants to be free", and they gravitate toward technology that enables them to download songs, newspaper, and yes, even textbook without cost.
* As attractive as that sounds, in the long run an entirely free world probably isn't feasibly. Remember the old expression, "there's no such thing as a free lunch?" At the end of the day, someone has to pay for content and services. Music artists and novelists (and yes, even textbook authors) can't create and receive nothing in return (for long, anyways). However, the restarant review on Yelp you won't get a check in the mail for your comments. But you may get "paid" by the satisfaction of sharing your foodie opinions with the uneducated masses. You may even receive a rating on some sites that designates you as a star reviewer. These are forms of **psychic income** (perceived value that is not expressed in monetary form) that help to grease the wheel of social media. Also referred to as **social currency**, people and brands need to earn a reputation for providing high value--whether that value comes from information, relevance, and/or entertainment.

## SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* Social media are a valuable context for marekting because of their access to people and their functionality. According to the American Marketing Association, **marketing** is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offers that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. The classic view is that organizations accomplish these goals through a **marketing mix** that includes the so-called Four Ps: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place (or distribution).
* As social media marketing techniques continue to sprout around us, today we need to add another P. Participation. It's fair to say that just as social media are changing the way consumers live on a daily basis, so too these new platforms transform how marketers go about their business. Whether our focus is to improve customer service, maintain customer relationships, inform consumers of our benefits, promote a brand or related special offer, develop a new product, or influence brand attitudes, new social media options play a role. **Social media marketing** is the utilization of social media technologies, channels, and software to create, communicate, deliver, and exchange offerings that have value for an organization's stakeholders. We can see this definition play out in emerging trends in social media. While social media marketing initially influenced brands' promotional plans, more recent business applications include social funding (e.g., Kickstarter for funding new business ventures).

### MARKETING COMMUNICATION: FROM TOP-DOWN TO BOTTOM UP
* Just as the horizontal revolution changed the way society communicates, the advent and adoption of social media change the way brands and consumers interact. Traditional marketing focuses on **push messaging** (one-way communication delivered to the target audience) using a large dose of broadcast and print media to reach a mass audience. There are minimal opportunities for interaction and feedback between customers and the organization, and **boundary spanners** (employees who interact directly with customers) mediate these dialogues. The brand message is controlled in a top-down manner by brand leadership within the organization.
* Even as digital technology developed in the 1990s and beyond, marketers still eseentially applied the traditional Four Ps model to reach customers. Over time they embraced the Internet as an environment for promotion and distribution. Ecommerce began to blossom as an alternative to other forms of promotion such as television, or radio. Consumers increasingly began to learn about product online--and to purchase them online as well. Ecommerce sites are websites that allow customers to examine (onscreen) different brands and to conduct transactions via credit card.
* This explosion in ecommerce activity was a boon to manufacturers, retailers, and nonprofit organizations because it offered greater speed, cost efficiencies, and access to micromarkets. A **micromarket** is a group of consumers once considered too small and inaccessible for marketers to pursue. Suddenly it became feasible for even a small company that offered a limited inventory to reach potential customers around the globe. The Internet enables efficient access to these markets, and in turn allows customers to search for very specialized products (e.g., music tracks by bands that recorded bass line music in Sheffield, England, between 2002 and 2005, or steampunk science fiction novels written by K.W. Jeter) to offer **niche products** that appeal to small, specialized groups of people.
* As it became clear that the Internet was not going to go away, marketers flocked to cyberspace. however, most of them still applied the familiar model of the Four Ps to the digital domain. This form of marketing, **traditional marketing**, is characterized by improvements in interactivity and measurement, but it retains the primary vertical flow of power in the channels of communication and distribution. Digital online messages made it possible for consumers to respond directly to an online **display ad** by clicking through to the ecommerce website. **Search advertising** grew during this time too, making it possible for online advertising to target both mass and miche audiences. Direct marketers widely adopted email marketing as a complement to direct mail and telemarketing.
* Despite these developments, modes of communication were still primarily vertical, one-way "mass communication", largely impersonal, and delivered from one to many. Whether you read the front page of the New York Times online at www.nytimes.com, or the new York Times app on your phone, or peruse the physical newspaper at your kitchen table, the content from the publisher is delivered vertically thorugh the channel of communication.
* Both traditional and tradigital marketing work on the basis of teh interruption-disruption model we discussed earlier. This means that the source of a communication delivers messages to audiences whether or not they want to receive them, and regardless or whether these messages are directly relevant to their unique needs. By design, an advertising message interrupts some prior activity: a commercial for L'Oreal mascara suddenly appears during the lastest episode of Real housewives, or perhaps a popup buble asks you to click on a link to learn more about low rates on car insurance while you browse a website.
* Why would Internet users tolerate these disruptions as they surf the web? For the same reason television viewers and radio listeners have for decades. The ad as interruption that provides a stream of revenue for the media provider also enables this sponsor to provide the content of interest at little or not cost to the audience. Television programming exists to draw audiences, which enables the network to sell space to advertisers who wish to reach that audience. The audience in turn accepts the presence of the advertising who wish to reach that audience. The audience in turn accepts  the presence of the advertising in order to consume the desired programming. This "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" relationship also describes the traditional Internet advertising: before you can watch a full episode of the Walking Dead on your laptop, you might sit through a 15 second ad for Verizon Wireless.
* In contrast, social media empower consumers. it isn't enough to interrupt the consumer experience and steal a few moments of attention. With social media marketing, the ability for consumers to interact and engage with brands is greatly enhanced. Social media channels give consumers unparalleled access. Consumers discuss, contribute, collaborate, and share--with brands and with each other. The culture of marketing has shifted to an informal one focused on the belief that customers are in control. Marketing guru Peter Drucker once famously said, "The purpose of a business is to create a customer". With the reach and community influence of social media, we can expand this definition: The purpose of a business is to create customers who create other customers. That participation in the process is the new fifth P of marketing.
* In the few years of social media's existence, social media marketing has expanded rapidly, as much for its efficiency given its low absolute as for its potential business applications as a tool for garnering customer attention, managing customer relationships, developing new product ideas, promoting brands, driving store (online and offline) traffic, and converting consumers to customers. Social media are not a substitute for traditional marketing communications, but they are more than a complement to traditional methods, as you'll see throughout this book. This shift from traditional to tradigital to social media is illustrated in Figure 1.5.

        * Boarcast, Print, Radio, Outdoors
        * Traditional Marketing: mass media, push orientation, outbound messaging, attention gained via orientation

        * Display ads, microsites, email, search
        * Tradigital marketing: mass and targeted online media, push orientation, outbound messaging with interactivity enabled

        * Networks, Communities, Blogs, Microblogs
        * Social Media Marketing: Niche online media, attraction orientation (pull), content attracts inbound traffic, attention gained via interactivity, dialogue, participation, sharing

### SOCIAL MEDIA ACHIEVES MARKETING OBJECTIVES
* As social media marketing has accelerated over the last few years, the objectives organizations can accomplish have also expanded. Table 1.2 shows the percentage of marekters using social media marketing to accomplish objectives across a range of marketing activities that include promotion and branding, customer service, relationship management, retailing and commerce, and marketing research.

        Table 1.2: Top Priorities for Business Using Social Media Marketing

        Social Media Marketing Priorities | % Companies Using
        * Brand awareness and brand building | 88.2
        * New product introduction | 64.7
        * New customer acquisition | 60.1
        * Brand promotions (e.g., sales promotoins, contests) | 59.2
        * Customer retention | 55.5
        * Customer service | 40.8
        * Employee engagement | 35.3
        * Market research |33.6
        * Targeting new markets | 25.6
        * Identifying new product opportunity | 17.2

* Just as the digital lives of consumers intersect across the four zones of social media, brands reach consumers in those same spaces to build awareness, promote themselves, and encourage users to try them. Let's take a closer look at some of the ways they do this.

## PROMOTION AND BRANDING
* Marketers have many possible techniques to promote goods, services, ideas, places, or people. Though there are potentially dozens of specific promotion objectives marketers may seek to accomplish, there are two overaching objectives relevant to the use of social media marketing as part of a brand's promotional mix:

1. Extend and leverage the brand's media coverage
2. Influence the consumer throughout the decision-making process.

* When it comes to acquiring space in media to distribute brand messages, **marketers have access to four core types of media: 1) paid, 2) owned, 3) earned, 4) shared.** This is illustrated in the PESO model, shown in Figure 1.6. Marketers are charged monetary fees for **paid media**, including purchasing space to deliver brand messages and securing endorsements. Paid media are traditionally the purview of **advertising**, defined as the paid placement of promotional messages in channels capable of reaching a mass audience. **public relations**, the promotional mix component tasked with generating positive publicity and goodwill, may also utilize paid media in the form of sponsorships. **Television commercials, radio ads, magazine print ads, newspaper ads, billboards, Internet display ads, and search engine marketing (SEM) all represent examples of paid media that may be incorporated in a brand's promotional plan. As we'll see in later chapters, other emerging formats include paying for messages in online games like Happy Pets or offering branded virtual goods to inhabitants of virtual worlds. And traditional sales promotions such as coupons and contests get a new life on social media platforms.

        FIGURE 1.6 PESO Model

        * Earn: Publicity, Media relations, Blogger relations, Investor relations, Influencer relations

        * Shared/Earned: (Influencer engagement), Response to detractors, Detractors turned loyalists, Detractors turned advocates

        * Shared: Facebook (living streaming), Twitter, Linkedin, Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram, Vine, Google

        * Owned: Websites, employer stories, customer stories (case studies), user-generated content, reviews, brand journalism, webinars/videos/podcasts

        * Paid/Owned: Affiliate, Brand ambassador, Sponsor content, native advertising (advertorial), Expert content

        * Paid: Facebook-sponsored posts, Sponsored tweets, Twitter cards, lead generation, TV & Other advertising, Direct marketing, Sales promotion

        * Paid/Earned/Shared/Owned: Optimized content, shared content, engaged content

* **Owned media** are channels the brand controls. Corporate websites and e-commerce sites, corporate blogs, advergames, and alternate reality games (ARGs) all represent forms of owned media. Just as Zara's brick-and-mortar retail stores are owned and controlled by the organization, so is its website.
* **Earned media** are those messages that are distributed at no direct cost to the company and by methods beyond the control of the company. **Word-of-mouth (WOM) communication** (called **influence impressions** in social media) and publicity are important forms of earned media. Comapnies release content through press releases and paid channels, participate in community events and causes, create stunt designed to generate media attention and buzz, and offer exceptional service quality, all with the hope that a brand message will spread. Shared media are communication channels in which marketers, people, journalists, and other participants share content (their own and others). Note that there is an overlap such that there are paid, earned, and owned elements of social media. Table 1.3 explains the forms of paid, earned, and owned media possible in each of the shared zones of social media marketing.

                Table 1.3: Types of media

                1. Zone: Social Community

                                * Branded entertainment
                4. Social Commerce

                                * Social storefronts

* A major objective related to using social media marketing for promotional purposes is to assist in moving the consumer through the purchase process. Marketers target various stages of this cycle to increase brand awareness, enhance brand liking and image, build brand equity, incite desire, and move consumers to action. They can influence consumer attitudes and movement through the process with promotional messages targeted throughout the social media channels. Figure 1.7 illustrates how marketers can use each zome of social media.

                FIGURE 1.7: Marketing Applications Across the Social Media Zones

                Social Media Marketing:

                Social Community:

                        * Enabling play 
                        * Branded entertainment

* Let's take a brief look at how social media marketing works at each stage of the purchase process:

1. Increase awareness: brands can increase awareness with social media marketing by maintaining an active presence in the social spaces where target consumers "live" and by integrating social media into the marketing mix. Unilever brand Knorr's "#LoveAtFirstTaste" campaign matched singles with similar food preferences, then set them up on dates, where they had to feed each other (and agree to be recorded). The campaign included an interactive flavor-profile quiz, a campaign landing page, and a series of social videos, including a popular Youtube video.
2. Infuence desire: social media promotion can be used much like advertising, catalog marketing, and feature events to persuade consumers to recognize a sense of desire. The fashion brand Lilly Pulitzer posts each new collection on Facebook, Flickr and Youtube. Visitors can tour pictures of its designs, fresh from each photo shoot. It's like being in the pages of Vogue.
3. Encourage trial: social media can even be used to support sampling and loyalty programs. **Sampling** means to offer a free trial of a product; these are usually mailed to consumers' homes or distributed in stores or on the street. Social media can be used to recruit interested prospects to qualify for samples. Celestial Seasonings used this approach to distribute 25,000 samples of its new tea flavors. Called Share the Magic, Facebook followers were asked to share how tea adds magic to their day and, in return, Celestial Seasonings sent a free sample and a coupon.
4. Facilitate purchase: social media serve as a distribution channel and venue for many sales promotion incentives, including deals and group offers. Many customers "like" or follow brands in social networks in order to qualify for special deals. The "You Can With a Canon" campaign rewarded those who rented a Canon M50 to claim a discount by posting their finest photography along with the hashtag "rentacanon".
5. Cement brand loyalty: social media venues offer engaging activities for consumers that can ensure they spend more time with the brand, hopefully resulting in higher levels of brand loyalty. Look no farther than social games that offer rewards for the most loyal visitors. That's just what grocery chain Lidl accomplished in the UK with its ingenious Social Price Drop campaign on Twitter. The campaign was designed to let its social media followers control pricing for select products during the holiday season. The more followers talked about an item on Twitter, such as the "Christmas lobster", the more that item's price dropped.

## CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE RECOVERY
* Despite all the hype we hear constantly about social media being the "new advertising", there are in fact other applications where these techniques will play an increasingly important role. For one, customer relationship management, or CRM, also finds a home here. CRM practices focus on what we do with a customer after the first sale; it's far more difficult (and expensive) to attract new customers than to keep old ones. That's why many organizations work hard to maintain contact with their customers and to provide additional products and services to them over time. Often they rely on sophisticated databases that keep an ongoing customized follow-up messages and offers that are likely to meet unique needs. Salesforce.com is among the leading business solutions for social CRM.
* Because of this digital focus, it's not surprising that CRM lends itself to social media applications. **Social CRM** embraces software and processes that include the collective intelligence of a firm's customers to more finely tune the offer and build intimacy between an organization and its customers. When brands embrace social CRM, they use social media as they were meant to be used. Why do we make this claim? Just as we learned that earned media can result from creative and interactive social messages, companies that do a good job of maintaining strong brand-to-customer relationships will benefit from earned media, as those customers in turn share information and recommendations with their networks.
* But this is a sword that cuts both ways. It's ideal when all of our interactions with customers are positive. Unfortunately, things sometimes go wrong. When they do, today's social consumers won't hesitate to share their nasty experiences with others on social platforms. They'll vent their frustrations in the most public of ways. A great example is the sad story of one man's plane trip that resulted in a busted guitar that went viral on Youtube (United Breaks Guitars" video on Youtube). After he tried unsuccessfullly to get United Airlines to repair or replace his guitar, this disgruntled passenger created his own version of the story and set it to music--the video he uploaded about his experience was viewed nearly 10 million times. Obviously, this was not a happy event for the airline. This illustration of the potential negative impact on a firm's image underscores how important it is for organizations to take customers commplaint seriously (especially those who are inclined to post about their experiences). It is also vital to have a plan in place to initiate **service recovery** when thigns do go wrong (and they will). This term refers to the actions an organization takes to correct mishaps and win back dissatisfied customers. One helpful set of guidelines that some companies use is known as the **LARA framework**
* **Listen** to customer conversations.
* **Analyze** those conversations.
* **Relate** this information to existing information within your enterprise.
* **Act** on those customer conversation

* Service recovery typically has to happen quickly if it's going to have any immpact. A firm that can identify a problem in the system (e.g., a product recall, a snowstorm that will ground flights) can nip it in the bud by letting customers know that it is aware of the issue and is taking steps to address it. That's a big reason why social media can play such a big role in CRM: the platforms they can use allow them to commmunicate quickly and efficiently to large groups of customers or to customize messages to individuals who require follow-up. For example, companies such as Carphone Warehouse, Zappos, Best Buy, and Comcast have turned to Twitter to conduct their social CRM: they can monitor trending topics and pre-empt problems if they find that a lot of people are tweeting about them (in a bad way). If neccessary, they can sent their own tweet to explain what happened and provide solutions.

## MARKET RESEARCH
* Social media open exciting new windows for marketing research. Whether to collect insights for the discovery stage of the creative process or to gather ideas for new product development, social media provide new tools to listen to customers as they discuss their lives, interests, needs, and wants. In fact, this social media marketing activity is called **social listening**. Social listening may be used for social CRM, service recovery, competitive analysis, or even ideas for new product development. We'll learn more about conducting research with social media in Chapter 10. Which channels of social media are relevant for social media market research? Potentially all of them, but profile data, activities, and content shared in social communities and content shared via social publishing vehicles are especially valuable for researchers.

## RETAIL AND ECOMMERCE
* The last major application for social media marketing is taht of retailing and ecommerce. We've already shared ways that brands can incentivize trial and purchase using social media promotions. If you are like most consumers, you've used your share of online ratings and reviews before you made a purchase decision. But did you know that you can go shopping in social storefronts or browse on ecommerce sites that enable real-time chat with your friends? That's right. Groups of friends can shop together even when everyone is online--and not necessarily in the same physical location. When brands use social media marketing as a retailing space, create a venue for and/or encourage consumer reviews and ratings of products, and enable applications that help friends shop together online, we've solidly in the social commerce zone. This will be our focus for Chapter 9.

## CRITICAL REFLECTION

### HOW ALGORITHMS INFLUENCE REALITY
* Algorithms are instructions for solving a problem or completing a task. Recipes are algorithms, as are math equations. Computer code is algorthmic. The Interest runs on algorithms and all online searching is accomplished thorugh them. The app on your smartphone are algorithms. Computer and video games are algorithmic storytelling. Anytime you are offered automated suggestions--whether people you may wish to friend on Facebook, programs to watch on Netflix, products to consider on Amazon, possible romantic matches on Tinder, restaurant recommendations on Yelp (we could go on)--algorithms are responsible.
* Algorithms help gadgets respond to voice commands, recognize faces, sort photos, and build and drive cars. Algorithms are mostly invisible aids, augmenting human lives with convenient knowledge delivered on demand. However, sometimes the application of algorithms created with good intention leads to unintended consequences. As you might have guessed, criminals exploit algorithms for hacking and cyber attacks. Algorithms are also blamed for unfortunate issues in the currency and stock markets.
* But algorithms are the subject of this critical reflection feature because of the effect they may have on your experience using social media--and ultimately on your life. In fact, some are calling this the Age of Algorithms. Algorithms are primarily written (by coders) to optimize efficiency and profitability without much thought about the possible societal impacts of the data modeling and analysis. A study of experts by Pew Research explained that in algorithmic design, humans are viewed simply as an "input" to the process, rather than as real, thinking, feeling, changing beings. This is already problematic, but is likely to become more so as algorithms begin to write the algorithms. At that point, the robot will decide the rules by which the algorithms produce solutions.
* Bart Knijnenburg, a professor at Clemson University, explained (cited in Rainie & Anderson, 2017): "Algorithms will capitalize on convenience and profit, thereby discriminating (against) certain populations, but also eroding the experience of everyone else. The goal of algorithms is to fit some of our preferences, but not necessarily all of them: They essentially present a caricature of our tastes and preferences." He went on to say, "My biggest fear is that... it will be simply too convenient for people to follow the advice of an algorithm (or, too difficult to go beyond such advice), turning these algorithms into self-fulfilling prophecies, and users into zombies who exclusively consume easy-to-consume items".
* Perhaps zombies is an exaggeration, but the risk of living in a filter bubble is real. What is filter bubble? Akin to living in a bubble, unable to experience the world, algorithms can limit our exposure to new information and different experiences, while influencing our beliefs and emotions with the content that is served to us. Is this risk real? In fact, it's already happening. Your news feed in Facebook is controlled by an algorithm designed to personalize the content you see based on your preferences and past behaviour. These are benefits--it means you see more of the stories you have liked in the past, from people and brands you've interacted with most, with the goal of enhancing your experience. It is this filtered access to our social network that inspired the quesiton "is social media even social anymore?"
* Do you see the flaw. The flow of content you see isn't random or even in real time. It is filtered such that you are increasingly less likely to see stories from people with whom you haven't engaged for a while. You will see more stories from people you agree with and less from people who might have a different opinion. Over time, you could adopt a very distorted view of the world. You also will be limited in new experiences. The information presented by algorithms will never surpise you will something you never thought you'd do, watch, or see because the solujtions are based on your past behaivour.
* That is, unless the solution are manipulated. What's that? You trust the information you get online? Not so fast. Facebook scientists collaborated on an experiment called the Contagion Experiment. One sample of Facebook users were served consistently negative stories and another sample saw positive content. Did the content influence the recipients? You bet it did. Those in the negative group began posting content that suggested they were in a bad mood and those who saw positive content posted happier messages. In other words, not only may our experiences by influenced by algorithms, our perceptions of our experiences may as well.

## CAREERS IN SOCIAL MEDIA
* Now you've seen how individuals and organizations, including businesses, non-profits, and governments, use social channels. As organizations learn the value of social media for marketing, new jobs come online every day to accommodate the need for skilled social media marketers. Interested?

## CASE STUDY

MEET 221BC KOMBUCHA
* 221BC Kombucha is a family-owned business dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles. Aneta and Eric Lundquist founded the company to inspire people to live their best lives one step at a time. Drinking kombucha, a nutrient-dense beverage with many health benefits, is a gateway habit to a healthy lifestyle.
* Kombucha is a bubbly, fermented tea with a host of health benefits. The basic ingredients in hombucha are yeast, sugar, and black tea. SCOBY, which stands for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, is an ingredient used in the production of kombucha. The mix is set aside for a week or more to ferment. Simply put, fermentation is where the activity of friendly bateria, yeasts, and probiotic enzymes eat the sugar in tea, transforming it into kombucha. The process is similar to how cabbage is preseved as sauerkraut or kimchi, or how milk is turned into yogurt. The tasty end product has B vitamins, probiotics, caffeine, and small amounts of alcohol.
* Kombucha has a long history. In fact, the name 221BC highlights the first known reference to the brewing of kombucha in China more than 2000 years ago? It was known as the "Tea of Immortality"! Aneta explains, "Kombucha is an ancient drink from Asia. The recipe is over 2000 years old. That's where our name came from--221BC stands for '221 before Christ'. We use high-quality organic tea leaves and sugar and ferment that in a culture, then add fresh-pressed, raw, organic unprocessed juices. It creates probiotics, enzymes, B vitamins. There's a trace amount of alcohol--less than 5 percent--but it's not considered an alcoholic beverage. (personal communication).
* Today, the kombucha market is growing rapidly. Globally, the market is projected to reach nearly $5 billion by 2025.
* Why the rapid growth? It goes beyond the popularity of beverage alternatives to soda. Kombucha purports to have many health benefits, especially benefits for gut health. Advocates say kombucha aids digestion, rids the body of toxins, and boosts energy. It's also said to boost immunity, support weight loss, ward off high blood pressure and heart disease, and even present cancer.
* Growing up in Poland, fermenting foods was a regular part of Aneta Lundquist's life. Every fall, her family harvested food from the garden. Some of that food was stored in underground cellars, while the rest was fermented in jars. Culturally, food was viewed as medicine for common aliments. After coming to ther US, Aneta realized that she didn't feel the energy she once felt. She committed to eating clean foods and using nutrient-dense foods as a core commitment to her family's health. She began brewing her own kombucha at home, experimenting with ingredients like bee pollen, turmeric, ginger, and matcha to influence the flavor and nutrition of her home brew. As the family transformed their eating habits, their health also improved dramatically, convincing Aneta's husband, Eric, that clean eating and kombucha should be a way of life.
* Today, Aneta defines herself as fermentarian; fluent in the language of good bacteria, she feels a natural connection to and understanding of the complex world of microbes. She's become obsessed with nature and the power of food to support a healthy life. With this goal in mind, she and Eric decided to begin 221BC Kombucha. Their mission goes beyond selling kombucha. Kombucha is simply one step that can serve as a gateway to healthy living.
* 221BC's product line offers several unique flavor blends, including:
* Berry Hibiscuss
* Grapefruit Bee Pollen
* Ginger
* Moringa Lavendar
* Orange Turmeric
* Jun Honey Matcha
* Lemon Cholorophyll
* Acai Beet
* Reishi Chai Core
* Yerba Power Green Core
* Yerba Power Berry Core
* 221BC is sold throughout and in a few major regional markets throughout the US, as well as abroad. Its channel of distribution is indirect in that it is sold through retailers such as Publix and Whole Foods. It is also sold on tap at healthy food bars and yoga studios. The company uses a premium pricing strategy with each bottle priced at or around $3.99 to $4.29. Competitively, 221BC is a relatively small player in a market overflowing with major brand like GT's Living Foods and Health-Ade as well as regional and niche brands.
* The company plans to use social media marketing to facilitate achieving its marketing objectives. Throughout an ongoing case study in this book, we'll walk side by side with Aneta and Eric and 221BC plans its social media marketing strategy. Currently, 221BC is active in the Social Community zone. you can follow 221BC and Aneta:

## SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* Marketers rely upon consumer insights to plan effective social media marketing strategies. Whether planning a campaign that will be executed entirely in social media or one for which social media are one component of an integrated marketing communications (IMC) campaign, understanding the needs, beliefs, and behaviours of the target market is key. Marketers use these insights to develop buyer personas that facilitate the strategic planning process. This is the focus of Chapter 2. We'll review the basics of segmentation, discuss individual and group behaviours in social media and why those behaviours occur, and detail segments found in social media communities.

## PROFILING THE TARGETED SEGMENTS
* Marketers value social media marketing strategies and techniques, but social media marketing will work only to the extent that these new media platforms can reach the customers that organizations want to talk to in the digital space. Marketers target specific segments whose needs they believe the brand is capable of satisfying in exchange for meeting organizational objectives. **Market segmentation** is the process of dividing a market into distinct groups that have common needs and characteristics. Segmentation enables marketers to achieve a trade-off between the efficiency of treating all customers the same and the effectiveness of addresssing all customers' unique characteristics. Marketers use several variables as the basis to segment markets, including geographic, demographic, psychographic, benefits sought, and behaviour. These characteristics represent the **bases of segmentation** marketers use when they divide a population into manageable groups.
* Marketers utilize these variables to segment and identify target audiences regardless of what kind of strategy will be used. But when it comes to social media marketing, we need to also take into account how prospective customers can be segmented according to their digital lives. Although it may seem like everyone is online, and most everyone is on Facebook, the extent to which a person's life is digital varies based on his or her lifestyle, personality, demographics, and even his or her geographic and economic conditions. For B2C (business-to-consumer) marketers, understanding these segments and how their attitudes and behaviours differ is a critical component in devising an effective social media marketing strategy. Marketers use this information and insight to develop profiles that help marketers make better campaign choices. Likewise, B2B (business-to-business) marketers also benefit from segmentation-driven targeting. Table 2.1 reviews the segmentation bases and exemplar variables. Let's briefly review the bases of segmentation and try to understand how these variables translate into the online world.

                        * Climate
                        * Environmental context (e.g., Indoor or outdoor)
                        * Language

## DMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* When marketers employ **demographic segmentation** they utilize common characteristics such as age, gender, income, ethnic background, educational attainment, family life cycle, and occupation to understand how to group similar consumers together. For example, General Mills creates specialized campaigns for different demographic segments, such as when it launched QueRicaVida.com as an online platform for Latina moms. B2B marketers also use demographic variables for segmentation but the variables of interest will relate to company size, industry vertical, buyer type, and other characteristics useful for describing businesses. Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin have made it easy for businesses to target prospects by offering targeting specifications based on information like interests, job title, company size, revenue, and more. When it comes to social media marketing, demographic segmentation help marketers to choose the right channels. This is because each SNS has a unique user profile. For example, Pinterest and Instagram have a larger percentage of female users than male, while Reddit has more male users. Facebook has a larger base of older users, while TikTok has a larger base of tweens and teens.

## GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* **Geographic segmentation** refers to segmenting markets by region, country, market size, market density, or climate. For example, North Face can expect to sell more parkas to people who live in winter climates, whereas Roxy will move more bikinis in sunny vacation spots. Geographic segmentation is increasingly relevant to social media marketers, not only due to location-based targeting based on a business's distribution channel, but also because social media increasingly incorporate **GPS technology**, a satellite system that provides real-time location and time information.
* The innovation aids local businesses that can use the technology to target specific people based on physical presence. Services such as Yelp position themselves as geotargeted social media. Yelp became popular for its user-generated reviews of local businesses. In fact, Yelp users have contributed more than 177 million reviews of local businesses. In mobile app helps users search for nearby businesses with the added value of reviews, ratings, and photos. Businesses can partner with Yelp to target Yelp users with adertising and in-app coupons. This is where segmentation strategy comes into play.
* For social media marketers, there are three geolocation techniques: geofencing, geotargeting, and beaconing. **Geofencing** is like a vritual line around a defined geographic space. As people with a geolocation mobile app enter the defineed area, they can be targeted with ads or offers. For example, if you have a smoothie shop at the mall, you could set up a geofencing around the mall and parking lot. As soon as people (with their devices enabled) come into that geofenced area, you can show them an ad with a deal. It's this same kind of functionality Snapchat uses to offer Snapchat geofilters--visual overlays that relay the "where" and "when" a Snap was taken. **Geotargeting** is similar to geofencing but the geographic parameters are more general, such as 50 miles from a zip code. The third type is **beaconing**, which has a very small range and is best for targeting locations within a store.

### EXHIBIT 2.1: YELP's GEOTARGETING ADDS VALUE
* Yelp's mobile app averages more than 20 million unique users per month. As Yelp mobile app users enter tageted geographic areas, local businesses in that area can reach out to them with special offers and interactive promotions such as free drinks or discounts. In fact, this is perhaps the most relevant strategies that engage on the social, mobile level. Importantly for the local merchants who use the service, Yelp offers a business "dashboard" that includes customization options for the business's page information and promotional offers, metrics on the number of Yelp views, notifications of new reviews, and message functionality for communicating with reviewers and heavy users. Through Yelp began primarily as a review site to help people find local businesses, it now incorporates transactional services as well. These include Eat24, YelpNow, SeatMe, and Request-A-Quote. Such services enable yelp to close the gap in the consumer decision-making process between information search and evaluation of alternatives and purchase. The services also provide another stream of revenue, in addition to advertising, for Yelp. Worried about privacy? We address privacy later in this chapter.

## PSYCHOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* **Psychographic segmentation** approaches slice up the market based on personality, motives, lifestyles, and attitudes and opinions. These variables may be used alone to combine with other segmentation bases such as demographics. Psychographics tend to provide the richest picture of a consumer segment in that the description of psychographic segments help marketers to know the real person making the consumption decisions. Psychographics are important to consumer insights but they are also actionable for targeting purposes. For example, GoPro can target social media posts based on people's interests like hiking or skiing.
* Let's consider a practical application of psychographics in the social media space. The greeting card industry has experienced declining sales for some time now. Instead of cards, people may send emails, e-cards, a direct message (DM), or even just a Facebook post! A large-scale study by Unity Marketing identified four psychographic segments among greeting card buyers. Unfortunately for the greeting card industry, a segment called "Alternative Seeker", the largest group the study identified, is also the most eager to use an alternative to the traditional card. Alternative Seekers view social media as an answer to stay in touch with friends and family on both a daily basis and on special occasions such as birthdays and holidays.
* Unity's report warns that greeting card companies are at risk as people use social media as a replacement for traditional cards. But this change presents an opportunity for others. Apps like Touchnote and justWink create a variety of virtual greeting cards that can be delivered on Facebook and other social networks. Even Starbucks enabled a Twitter app that lets you give a cup of coffee to someone with a simple tweet!

## BEHAVIORAL SEGMENTATION
* **Behavioural segmentation** divides consumers into groups based on their actions. Exemplary variables include product research sources, the nature of the purchase, brand loyalty, usage level, frequency of purchase, and distribution channels used. Notice that these very same variables are valuable for B2B segmentation. When it comes to social media, marketers may use **behavioural information such as how much time prospective customers spend online and on social media, what activities they participate in on social media, which social networks they use, and the devices they use to access social media as segmentation variables.** Behavioural segmentation also helps with ad targeting. For example, you can segement and build target audiences for Facebook advertising based on people's past engagement with your Facebook page and ads.
* According to Global Web Index's Social Flagship Report, people's social media behaviour is a valuable segmentation variable. It categorized social media users based on their primary following patterns in social media and **found that people can be categorized into social usage personas like personal networkers, celebrity networkers, brand followers, and shoppers.**

## BENEFIT SEGMENTATION
* **Benefit segmentation** groups individuals in the marketing universe according to the benefits they seek from the products available in the market. For example, in the auto industry people who buy hybrids and electric cars look for different benefits from a car than those who buy muscle cars or SUVs. For business prospects, benefits sought might be about "how soon can it be delivered" or "can the purchase be invoiced?" The Job-To-Be-Done theory is useful for understanding benefits sought. It holds that to create a product or service that customers want to buy, marketers must understand the outcomes prospective customers are seeking. In other words, we need to understand the job the customer needs the product to perform.
* Brands may use social media to identify benefits customers want. That's how McDonald's identified the demand for its new "All Day Breakfast" menu--more than 80,000 tweets specifically mentioned the need for breakfast options all day. What benefits do consumers want from their interactions with brand in social media environments? There are competing want from their interactions with brands in social media environments? There are competing schools of thought on this issue. Some industry experts argue that consuemrs want to have meaningful relationships with the brands they use frequently, and particularly with those brands they consider lovemarks. This term, developed at Saatchi & Saatichi, refers to brands that inspire passionate loyalty in their customers.
* Others believe consumers seek a more functional relationship with brands, but will offer loyalty for those that meet their needs. This is the view taken in research on the social currency of brands.**social currency** measures the ability of brands to fit into how consumers manage their social media-centric lives. Based on the premise that social consuemrs are defined by the extensive use of technology and social media, liimited time and attention for decision-making, and a desire for value and utility, the social currency construct assesses brand contribution to several desirable benefits. How do ocnsumers respond to brands with high social currency? The study, which assessed 90 brands over five industries, found that people were more likely to choose these brands and more willing to pay a price premium.

### MINI CASE STUDY: THE POWER OF SOCIAL CURRENCY
* The Power of Social Currency was designed to measure the ability of brands within retail, fashion, automotive, food, and beer to adapt to the ways consumers manage their social lives. The report asserted that brands often struggle to keep up with changing consumer preferences. To succeed in social currency, brands should focus on initiatives across seven dimensions that help consumers manage their lives more effectively and efficiently. The modern social consumer is defined by a number of different characteristics that contribute to a desire for social currency benfits:

* manage their lives and achieve their goals using technology across context and culture
* make decisions with limited attention, time and effort
* use social media for information and entertainment, and
* comparison shop for cheaper and/or more convenient alternatives

7 Social Currency Dimensions
* How much my relationship to the brand plays into my **self-image** and **self-esteem**.
* How much **I feel a sense of belonging** and **kinship** with others who use the brand. 
* How much the brand facilitates **communicating who I am**
* How much the content shared by/about the brand **engages me**
* How much the brand helps me forge **new social connections** or **relationships**
* How much other people help me **discover evaluate** and **make** decisions about the brands.
* How much my engagement with the brand or its customers **enhances the value** I get from the brand.

RESULTS AND OUTCOMES
* The top ten brands in social currency were Nike, Subway, Olive Garden, Southwest Airlines, Honda, Levi's, Wendy's Under Armour, Chili's, and Toyota. Nike scored an indexed social currency composite of 119--a weighted composite of the brand's results on the seven dimensions. The score are interpreted to mean that Nike provides social currency benefits at a 19% higher rate than the average of the other 90 brands included in the study.

* The results suggest brands can use social media engagement with customers to build the relationship--conversing, sharing, caring, and interacting in each other's lives over time (Just like people do). We'll take a deep look at how brands can engage consumers using social community (zone 1) in Chapter 6.

## PULLING IT ALL TOEGETHER
* Marketers use these bases of segmentation to construct **buyer personas**. A persona is a snapshot of your ideal customer that tells a story using the information you used for segmentation (i.e., demographic, geographic, psychographic, benefits sought, and behaviour). This "bio" provides a composte sketch of the desired target market. With personas, marketers are better able  to identify, understand, acquire, engage, and retain the target audience. For example, Geckoboard, a company offering data visualization software for social media analytics, describes its buyer personas as a young to middle aged founder or chief executive-level decision-maker, at an organization in a high-growth, digital business with 11-200 employees, located in the United States, Western Europe, Australia, or Canada. Figure 2.2 provides an example of a persona.

                FIGURE 2.2 Buyer Personas
                * Who is he: 
                        * CEO of large financial firm worth $100 million; 
                        * Has been in role for 5 years
                        * **He is an innovative and a risk taker**
                        * He likes to communicate via email, face to face or by phone
                        * He is on LInkedin and Twitter
                        * He reads financial and economic news source online
                        * He likes to attend financial conferences
                * How he finds vendors
                        * He trusts referals and word of mouth
                        * He goes to the webiste during the initial phase of his buying journey
                        * He is not interested in using the information on the website beyond initial research. He prefers to weight his options before making any buying decisions.
                * Pain points:
                        * There are eight people involved in the purchase decision for his financial firm
                        * He is looking for a competitive price, with strong team experience and a track record of good creative work.
                        * The size of the team representing him is important. He always wants in-market representative, to allow for easier communication flows.
                * What he wants to know:
                        * Expertise
                        * Case studies
                        * Example of work
                        * Awards
                        * References
                        * Strong partnership
                * What he doesn't want
                        * He doesn't want to pay large fees, or be lokced in a long-term contract. Vlaue for money is important, as is his ability to change direction if needed.
                * Why he buys from us:
                        * Price and team expertise
                * How we retain him
                        * He is very hands-on and likes open lines of communication. Respond to a change requests quickly
                        * Monthly recaps
                        * Pitch new, out of the box ideas.
                        * Share latest industry news and best practices

* Marketers also use the segmentation bases and variables for targeting social media audiences. For marketers using Facebook, the following bases and variables can be sued to target posts and ads:

                * Demographics: Facebook offers many demographic targeting options, including age, sex, income, marital status
                * Location: you can target users by state, locality, zip code, and country
                * Psychographics: Facebook enables targeting by interests
                * Behaviour: Behaviour use the Facebook Pixel to target users. Pixel is a piece of code that tracks user behaviour so that you can display ads to people that behave in certain ways. For example, you might show ads to people who subscribe to your blog. It is also possible to target on engagement such as when someone comments, "likes" or follows you on social media.

## SOCIAL IDENTITY
* Facebook? Youtube? Flickr? Twitter? Which of these sites do you make a part of your digital life? What are you sharing? Thoughts, opinions, activities, photos, videos? When and from where? On the go with a mobile device? From a fixed location using a stationary computer? These days, the answer is most or all of the above. We all have an image of ourselves, or a sense of who we are; this is called our **self-concept**. From a psychoological perspective, **social identity** is the part of our self-concept that results from our perceived memebership in a group. We can break this rather abstract-sounding notion into two components. First, we think of ourselves as members of some groups but not others. At any point in time, what we're doing and where we are brings one of our groups front of mind. When playing a video game, for instance, we might see ourselves as a member of an affinity group of gamers. We probably won't be identifying with people who like baking. Second, we belong to many, many groups--some formal, some informal; some aspirational, some actual. If we are aware of our membership and the group is important to us, it can affect our social identity. What does this have to do with social media? When we participate in social media, we are engaging with one or more groups. From the broadest view, posting on Instagram is an interaction with the group of Instagram users.
* Our online activities and the information we post document and express our social identity--the way we represent ourselves via our social connections, community memebership, participation, and shared text, images, sounds, and video--to others who access the web. Consequently, social identity can influence where, when, how and what you contribute as a social media participant.
* **Marketers are interested in your social identity--along with other information useful for segmenting and targeting you, like your demographic characteristics, your interests, and lifestyle, your personality traits, where you live and work, your shopping behaviours offline and online, and so on. Where do they get this data? From a host of sources--smart marketers will license data from multiple sources to build a dataset useful for marketing analytics.** One of the sources is social data. As you participate online, you leave behind residue, sometimes calleed social exhaust. The residue becomes a source of **big social data**, data generated from technology-mediated social interactions and actions online, which can be collected and analyzed. When marketers assess this information, the portrait they paint of you is their view of your social identity. Altimeter defines the marketers' view of social identity as "the information about an individual available in social media, including profile data and ongoing activity". In other words, social identity is the way marketers view you given your social media activities.
* Just as direct marketers have long known that a more complete customer profile can lead to better targeting of offers, marketers now recognize the utilizing social data can further enrich these profiles. Marketers can use this information to identify new leads, convert prospects to customers, resolve service issues, and more. For example, if a brand can associate an Instagram user who posts a picture with a complaint caption with a customer who has purchased often in the past, it can resolve the complaint, retain the customer, and build high customer lifetime value. Altimeter belives using social identity data helps brands to build richer customer profiles, efficiently use marketing budgets, and engage across channels. Brands can use social identity data at all points in the purchase funnel, whether they seek to identify prospects, nurture leads, tailor recommmendations, follow up with customers to enhance retention, or reward loyalty.

## SOCIAL TOUCHPOINTS: THE DNA OF SOCIAL IDENTITY
* Let's take a closer look. Perhaps in a typical day you wake up using an alarm clock app on your smartphone. After you snooze the alarm, you might check your news feeds on Facebook Mobile. You leave home and head for school. In transit, you stay connected with your smartphone or even an Internet-enabled car if you drive a new Ford. You might search for reviews on the best place for coffee along your route, or the cheapest source of gas. When you get to class, your professor might ask you to work collaboratively in a wiki on a class assignment or bookmark research for a group project using an app lik Evernote. Later that night, you might watch The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. you get ready for your evening shift at work. When Jimmy tweets out the hashtag for tonight's Hashtag Games, you turn to Twitter to play along, hoping to be among those chosen to be on the show. See what we mean? Everywhere you go, as long as you have an Internet-enabled device, social media can be a part of your daily life. The opportunities exist as **social media touchpoints**. You can see the possibilities for these touchpoints in Figure 2.3. These touchpoints leave impressions, and they make up the data that marketers use to paint your social identity.

                Skip Figure 2.3

## SOCIAL FOOTPRINTS
* A footprint is the impression on mark on an object makes when it occupies a physical space. Depending upon the surface material, the impression may remain sometime after the indention was created--when a budding graffiti artist happens upon a patch of drying cement, the rest is history! Similarly, a **social footprint** is the mark a person makes when he or she is present in a social media space. As we visit websites and web communities, we leave a digital trail behind. This social footrpint may be subtle or obvious depending upon the quantity and frequency of visits and the activities in which we participate. For example, when you visit your friend's Facebook profile and learn that she's a fan of Juicy Couture, you learn something about what matters to her. This information is one aspect of her social footprint. 
* Like Hansel and Gretel who dropped breadcrumbs to mark their way in the forest, you leave traces as you interact online and especially as you share social content. Have you ever "liked" a site, an article, or a product? Footprints. Did you ever shop online? More footprints. Comment on Youtube videos? Download podcasts from iTunes or upload pictures on Instagram? That's right... more footprints. Records of your activities may make up a **lifestream** (assuming you share detail with regularity), which is essentially a diary you keep through your social media acitivities.
* Your footprints become a source of the big social data (we'll cover how marketers use the data in Chapter 10). The footprints are useful for making predictions about people--even broad, seemingly innocuous measures, such as the number of times you've logged into Facebook, and number of "likes", comments, and shares. According to Michal Kosinki, a Stanfrod-based researcher who coordinated a collaborative research study of the Facebook footprints of 8 million volunteers, social footprints can effectively predict surprisingly personal traits--including whether your parents are divorced.

## YOUR SOCIAL BRAND
* Your deposit social footprints throughout the social communities you visit. Many socila communities require registration as a member of the community in order to access services and join in community activities. Lacking visible bodies, people actively construct profiles that reflect how they want to be identified in social media spaces. Your username in social communities is a handle or nickname, just like those tuck drivers used on their old-fashioned CB radios. It may be a psyudonym of your real name. Although many digital natives use pseudonyms that can hide real identities and maintain some privacy, others choose handles that describe something about them in shorthand as they try to build a following. We can  think of these IDs as our digital brand name. Rather than hide one's identity,  they heighten the meaning associated with one's name. For example, digital media guru Jennifer Leggio, a prominent blogger for ZDNet, uses the handle "mediaphyer" to represent her social digital footprint.
* Before settling on a handle, be sure that you aren't handle-squatting. This term refers to the use of a digital brand name by someone who really doesn't have a claim to the brand name. Sometimes another person may have a legitimate claim to the name--many of us have names that are not unique. For instance, there are hundreds of men named David Jones in the world. In that case, use of the handle doesn't constitue squatting. On the other hand, a quick search of Twitter fo actor Hugh Jackman turns up several people listings, including @RealHughJackman, @jackmanHugh, @HughJackman, and @H_Jackman, among others. Only one is the "real" Hugh Jackman--the others are probably handle-squatters.
* Next, you should find out whether your desired username is available in the many social communities. Services like Namechk.com make this easy. A sign of the times--parents are using services like this to choose baby names (to find a unique name) and then registering their newborns in social networks to reserve the handle!

### YOUR SOCIAL BRAND IN THE AGE OF SELFIES
* The first selfie was shared in early 2011, and in just a few years the hashtag #selfie has been used on Instagram more than 185 million times. That's just one social vehicle and one hashtag. People use the hashtag #me just as much! A hashtag is a word or phrase comprised of letters, numbers, and/or emojip receded by what was once referred to as the pound symbol (#). Your selfies are indicators of your social brand and, like your handle, they differ from many other sources of information that make up your social identity. Aspects of your identity over which you have a great deal of control are thought to be active, while activities associated with typical participation in social channels are thought to be more passive. The less control you have over the information, the more passive it is in terms of influencing your identity. A selfie is one of the most active aspects because you are in control. You may take several shots, but you publish only the ones you like--if you publish it all.
* We'll explain later in this chapter how marketers can use the information that makes up your social identity to target you more effectively, but what does your social identity say to others? To your friends, family, employers, teachers? That's the question Andy Beal addresses in Repped, a book designed to show people how to protect their own reputations in a social economy. Why is it important? Because, as we discussed in Chapter 1, social media are a reputation economy. Brian Solis perhaps said it best: "Think about it this way. When you look in the mirror, you see a reflection of who you are right now. What if you could transform that reflection each day into someone you hoped to see staring back at you?" You can with the choices you make. Solis suggests that people conduct their own social activity audit. Sounds like a useful activity? It should. It's a personal version of a **social media audit**, the exercise marketers use to assess the situation and their competitors' social presence! A personal audit should categorize social media activity according to the values expressed in the social engagement:

                * Vision: a vision post answers the questions: "Did I learn something? Was I inspired?"
                * Validation: a validation activity answers the question, "Am I accepted by a group?"
                * Vindication: a vindication post informs others, "I am right."
                * Vulnerability: a vulnerability post opens one's self to others, "I am approachable."
                * Vanity: a vanity post reveals a tendent to narcissism, "Look at me. I am all that".

* Footprints should reveal a social identity that is balanced. We all have aspects of these avlues inside. But when our footprints are focused more in certain areas, we may inadvertently paint a distored picture of ourselves.
* Once you've completed the audit, you will be ready to cultivate a personal brand identity using social media. Daniel Tolliday of  the Social media Examiner poses five questions--the answers will guide your choices as you build your social brand:

                * What goal are you seeking to accomplish?
                * What do you want to be known for?
                * What groups and people are active in your desired field and which social media channels do they use?
                * What can you do to communicate your desired social brand identity while also differentiate yourself from others?
                * What visual elements will support the image you want to accomplish?

* Who knows! You could become the next "it" social media influencer. That's one of the exciting benefits of social media. Anyone with a unique point of view can gain a following.
* To summarize, your social footprint leaves evidence of where you are and where you've been. Your lifestream is the journal of your digital life. Taken together, they make up your social brand, what marketers call your social identity. When you look at this evidence, we think you'll agree: youare what you share.

### CRITICAL REFLECTION
WHICH RIGHT MATTERS MOST? THE RIGHT TO KNOW OR THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY?
* We've warned that reputation is everlasting in the realm of social media. But is that really so? The Court of Justice of the European Union thinks differently. Under Data Protection Directive, its so-called Right to be Forgotten ruling, the Court declared that people have a right to control, at least to some extent, the access others have to digital information about them. In other words, if you don't like some of the information that makes up your social identity, just ask Google that it not be found! And yes, your public activities in social communities are indexed! Try Googling yourself to see what others could see. While you may appreciate this "do-over" approach to burying past mistakes, it creates tension between the right to privacy and that of free speech. Japan's top court recently ruled on a right to be forgotten case and determined that the country's legal system prioritizes the public's right to know over privacy. Denying a plaintiff's bid to remove search results on Google about his child pornography-related criminal record, the high court said that search engines assist users in obtaining necessary information from massive volumes of data and, therefore, play pivotal roles in modern society's Internet-based information distribution. The court listed six factors to guide society's Internet-based information distribution. The court listed six factors to guide future cases in determining which should be suspended--freedom of speech or privacy:

                1. nature and content of information resulting from search engine search
                2. plaintiff's damage
                3. plaintiff's social status and power
                4. searched articles' objective and meaning
                5. societal conditions
                6. necessity of posting searched information
                
===

* Google recently won a landmark case in which the EU's top court ruled that Google does not have to remove links globally--only in Europe. Thus, even those who have the right to be forgotten are faced with some geographical limitation.

### EXHIBIT 2.2
COMPANIES USE SELFIE TOO!
* GT's Living Foods, the leading brand of kombucha, is just one of several brands, like Toyota, Mastercard, Disney, and Tarte Cosmetics, leveraging the popularity of selfies in marketing campaigns. GT's decided to use the #selfie trend to inspire kombucha fans to submit user-generated content. The brand released a video encouragin viewers to post selfies with a GT's Kombucha bottle and the hashtag #infullbloom. For each selfie, the brand donated $5 to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. The connection to a charity enabled GT's to leverage the altruism motive to participate in social media and the selfie appealed to the validation impulse.

## MOTIVES AND ATTITUDES INFLUENCING SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES
* Web users increasingly participate in social networks such as Facebook, play online social games (turn-based, multi-player games designed to be played within social networks) such as Candy Crush within the network community, watch videos, listen to music, comment on the posts of friends, update status messages, and share content. Likewise, brands are active on these sites as they add content and try to converse with consumers. Research from GfK identified the top social activities:

                * visiting a friend's profile page
                * commenting on a friend's post
                * sending a private message
                * watching a video
                * posting pictures
                * linking a post
                * updating status
                * follwing, liking, or becoming a fan of somet hign or someone
                * playing a social game
        
* **For marketers, understanding the motives for social media participation can facilitate the design of effective social media marketing campaigns. What motives are behind participation in social media? Chances are there are many reasons that drive your activity in social communities. Some of these motives probably seem like no-brainers, but others may surprise you. These are the most common impulses researchers have identified:

* **Affinity impulse**: social networks enable participants to express an affinity, to acknowledge a liking and/or relationship with individuals and reference groups. Affinity relates to the affective dimension of social identity. When you use Facebook to stay in touch with high school friends and to make new friends, you are responding to the affinity impulse. This is also referred to as a social function. When people contribute to social communities for this reason, they do so to form friendships and feel a sense of belonging. The affinity impulse is related to a person's desire for social capital. **Social capital** refers to the resources created by the **building and maintaining of relationships in social networks.**
* **Personal utility impulse**: While we tend to think of social media participation truly as community participation, some do consider, "What's in it for me?" This is the personal utility impulse and it may be one of the most important motives for brands to acknowledge. Studies of participation in social communities report that utility, whether in the form of information seeking, incentive seeking, entertainment seeking, or convenience seeking, is a major motive for social media activity. The findings are congruent with others utilizing a uses and gratification approach to understanding social media behaviour. For instance, one study found 60% of Internet suers used social media as a source of health-related information. Participants consulted online reviews of doctors, hospitals, and medical treatments; posted reviews of their own experiences; and posted questions in social networks
* **Contact comfort** and **immediacy impulse**: people have a natural drive to feel a sense of psychological closeness to others. Contact comfort is the sene of relief we feel from knowing others in our network are accessible. Immediacy also lends a sense of relief in that the contact is without delay. Do you feel lost without your mobile phone? Do you feel anxious if you haven't checked Facebook recently? When you rely to a message, do you keep checking for a response? These are indicators of your need for contact comfort and **contact immediacy**. Social media users even seek contact comfort and immediacy from brands. One study found that nearly 40% of respondents believed brands were very likely to engage with them on social networks and 25% expected a response within an hour of leaving a comment on a brand's Facebook or Twitter page. In another study, participants named timeliness and speed of response and sense of connection among the attributes they associate with the most successful brands using social media.
* **Altruistic impulse**: some participate in social media as a way to do something good. They use social media to "make the world a better place", and "pay it forward". The altruistic impulse is also aided by the immediacy of social media, and this value has been played out in the **immediate altruistic response** of social media suers to aid calls during crises such as the earthquake relief for Haiti or Japan. Individuals want to do good an do it quickly--social media make it easier to contribute in the form of a cash donation or a service to the community. The altruistic impulse serves a value-expressive function in that it enables individuals to express their own moral beliefs through their social media behaviour. Altruism can also explain negatively valenced social media activities including **altruistic punishment**, in which social media users seek to draw attention to a company or person whose behaviour is unacceptable to the social community. Beware of the difference between the altruistic impulse and affinity and validation impulses. Known as **virtue signaling** (and sometimes "hashtag activism" or "slacktivism"), people may give token support for a cause with a simple post-share or like. The altruistic impulse is intrinsically motivated. If the underlying motive is to affirm a relationship, publicity build one's image, or shame others, altruism is not the social media motive at play.
* **Curiosity impulse**: When people use social media to gain new knowledge and stimulate intellectual interests, **epistemic curiosity** is the driver. Another form of curiosity is the **pruient impulse**. Online, we can satisfy our curiosity by "following" people on Twitter and visiting their profiles. Surely it is the pruient impulse that led millions of Twitter users to follow Kim Kardashian's daily tweets, while millions of other relentlessly tract the ups-and-downs of Justin Bieber--will he prevail, or crash and burn?
* **Validation impulse**: social media focus intently on the individual. You can share many or as few of your opinions and activities as you like, and comment on those of others. This focus on the self highlights the validation impulse, in other words, feeding one's own ego. That's why the validation impulse is sometimes referred to as the ego-defensive function. This function is thought to be particularly relevant as people seek to eliminate perceived external threats and eliminate self-doubts. Certain behaviours are affiliated with people driven by the validation impulse. These include the prevalence of selfies among the mix of posts, a tendency to check to seek whether posts received "likes", a tendency to overshare, and a tendency to impression manage (e.g., promoting the perfect life). These were among the behaviours noted by researchers in a study that investigated types of narcissism in social media. Particularly on Facebook and Twitter, people may use posts to show superiority (particularly by expressing opinions) or to participate in exhibitionism. That's why Brian Solis, a thought leader in the realm of social media, advises to guard against the dreaded disease "accidental narcissm". Perhaps it's no wonder then that an analysis of Twitter posts found that 80% were posted by "meformers" and just 20% by informers. Meformers post updates primarily related to themselves such as commentary on their daily mood and acitivites, while informers post updates that share and/or link to information. Though informers were less prevalent, the study revealed that they have twice the number of followers as meformers.

* Though all of these motives have been linked to social media participation, one study suggested tht the validation motive, and especially the aspect related to developing a desirable image, is the dominant driver of social media activities. Whether a conscious decision or not, image management is a major factor in social media participation. Particularly when one is narrowcasting (i.e. communicating with just one person) rather than braodcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people), people will avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. How can we know whether our friends are revealing their "true selves" to us online? The answer may be in the content--a study of true self-expression on Facebook found that people who felt comfortable sharing their "true self" tended to post personally revealing and emotional content. Earlier we encouraged you to audit your social media activities and to consider using social media to brand yourself. As part of the exercise, you may want to consider how mcuh separation between personal friends and professional colleagues you prefer and whether you will use social media as a tool for enhancing your professional reputation. The choices you make will result in one of four strategies to guide the boundaries you set between personal and professional contacts while accomplishing your goal. Figure 2.4 illustrates the four strategies and includes recommendations to guide your social media activity.

                FIGURE 2.4: A Framework for Understanding Social Sharing Boundaries
                Self-verification, Integration: 
                        Open boundary management behaviour: Open your profiles to personal and professional contacts
                
                Self-verification, Separation: 
                        Audience boundary management behaviours: Exclude professional contacts from your social media profiles

                Self-enhancing, Integration:

## PRIVACY SALIENCE: HOW MUCH DO THEY KNOW AND HOW MUCH DO YOU CARE?
* It's helpful for marketers to understand motives for social media participation and sharing as we make strategic marketing decisions, but the residue left behind from your social footprints is also of value. That residue of big social data makes up the social identity information that marketers can use to augment other customer information, conduct research, target advertising and other promotions, and more.
* Are you concerned about privacy as it relates to your social media activities? The extent to which one worries about privacy and the risks related to the collection, unauthorized secondary use, errors in, and improper access of personal data is known as privacy salience. Interestingly, privacy salience doesn't necessarily explain whether social media users take steps to protect their privacy. Because of this disparate relationship, researchers call the phenomenon the **privacy paradox**. The privacy paradox describes people's willingness to disclose personal information in social media channels despite expressing high levels of concern for privacy concerns as a two-part systems: System 1 is **intuitive concern** and System 2 is **considered concern**. Intuitive concern is an emotional gut reaction to a possible privacy invasion, while considered concerned is an emotional gut reaction to a possible privacy invasion, while considered concern involves identifying possible privacy risks, estimating the potential costs of privacy invasions, and deciding whether any benefits offset those costs. Thus, it is possible for social media users to have high intuitive concern and yet determine that the risk doesn't warrant action.
* Privacy concerns also take on multiple forms, including social privacy and institutional privacy. Social privacy refers to concerns about disclosing personal information to others. Institutional privacy is privacy relating to the use of data by the institution providing the service and third parties. Research suggests that people are taking steps to protect their social privacy. Common strategies include using privacy settings to restrict access, excluding personal contact information, untagging and removing photographs, and limiting contact to known others. While it's still common to disclose (and perhaps overshare) intimate information, people may feel comfortable sharing because they've taken steps to protect social privacy.
* Some suggest that privacy is viewed differerntly by differernt generations. In particular, today's teens exhibit lower levels of privacy salience. According to Pew, teens share a lot of information in social channels:

                * 92% have posted their real name to the profiles they use
                * 91% have posted a selfie.
                * 82% have posted their birth date
                * 71% have posted the name of the school they currently attend
                * 71% have posted the name of the town in which they live.
                * 64% who use Twitter have a public profile
                * 53% have posted their email address
                * 20% have psoted their mobile phone number
                * 16% have allowed sites to auto-post their location.

* Why so much sharing? It may be the view of the social context. If social media communities are viewed as private, the expectation is the social norms will prevent inappropriate use of the content and people should feel comfortable disclosing sensitive information. If these spaces are viewed as public rather than private communities, users may disclose more carefully, recognizing that the content may have a broad reach beyond the intended audience. People, particularly young people, may view social media profiles as forms of "produced self" and tend to see social communities as public venues. In other words, people may view privacy in social media settings as networked privacy. With **networked privacy**, people understand that their personal information is likely to be compromised by technological and social violations and that any protective behaviours they may invoke are likely to be insufficient. People may develop an attitude of "privacy cynicism" as a copying mechanism, leading to a resigned neglect of behaviours that would protect privacy. Another explanation is that social media users use a mental cost-benefit approach to justify negating their privacy concerns when trust is high, marginal risk is low, and the entities collecting the data aren't overtly present.
* Privacy salience may also vary by cultural region. A study by marketing research firm Ipsos found just that! you might be surprised by the outcome, though. When asked for a descriptor of how much they share online, one in four people around the world said they share everything. The United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany all under indexed while countries such as Saudi Arabia over indexed. There may be a relationship between Internet penetration and oversharing. Nearly all of the countries reporting oversharing are in areas with lower Internet penetration, while the countries that undershare primarily European, where Internet penetration is high.

## SOCIAL MEDIA SEGMENTS
* Because social media are such new areas, marketers are still figuring out just how to use them, and to what extent they should rely on these platforms when they identify their target markets and try to communicate with them. One brand may add a social media piece to a broader strategy when it creates a Facebook page, whereas another may replace virutally all of its traditional advertising with "new media" messages. Decisions regarding just how much to rely on social media and how to design programs that will be effective require us to understand as much as we can about just who participate in social media and how they may differ from one another.
* Understanding these nuances will help you to ensure that the social media marketing strategies and tactics you plan have a shot to resonate with the target market. There are countless examples of social media marketing campaigns that have failed. In fact, Gartner, a research firm specializing in technology, claims that half--that's right, 50%--of social media campaigns fail. Why the huge number of bombs? Probably a major reason is simply that the social strategy is not matched to the target audience. A contest that requires players to upload original content will not succeed with a target market that primarily consumers content but does not create its own. A promotion for a free song download offered on Twitter will not work if the band's fans tend to hang out on SoundCloud instead. A stunt from Skittles to feed live streams from social media communities to its website will not appeal to parents if the live feed includes profanity inappropriate for their children. Let's take a look at several social segementation models, each of which offers insights about social media users.

## SOCIAL TECHNOGRAPHICS
* Forrester Research introduced the concept of **Social Technographics** based on research if conducted on the social and digital lives of consumers. This work became the foundation for a book, Groundswell, by Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff (2008). From that first study, Forrester identified six types of people (of those online) based on how those people use and interact with social media. **Categories included joiners, creators, critics, collectors, and conversationalists.** The types were not exclusive--some people fit into more than one category based on their activities. The behaviours are still useful, but as the population of social media users became increasingly savvy and engaged, Forrester revised the model to incorporate an overall score of social media usage. The new framework emphasizes that people rely on social media at varying degrees throughout the stages of purchase decisions.
* The Social Technographics score reflects how actively a segment uses social tools, how important those tools are within the stages of the consumer life cycle, and how willingly they engage with brands in social media. The score ranges from 0 to 100 and includes four types of social media users: 1) social skippers, 2) social snackers, 3) social savvies, and 4) social stars.

* **Social stars** (scores of 60+) demand social interactions with your company. These consumers constantly use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products. For stars, social media are the preferred choice for interaction with and about brands and products. What's more, with their high discretionary spending via multiple channels, including mobile, social stars are valuable customers to acquire.
* **Social savvies** (scores of 30 to 59) expect social interactions with your company. Social media are still a part of their everyday lives and  they frequently use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products.
* **Social snackers** (scores of 10 to 29) appreciate social interactions with your company. They don't shy away from branded social interactions, but neither do they seek them out--meaning that marketers targeting this audience should treat social tools as a secondary part of their marketing plans.
* **Social skippers** (scores of 0 to 9) spurn social interactions with your company. They rarely use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products. Skippers prefer to interact with companies through established channels such as email, catalogs, and brick-and-mortar stores--so marketers targeting this audience should put as few resources as possible into their social efforts. You may be surprised to learn that skippers constitute more than 20% of the general population, but don't worry. Skippers tend to be older, brand-switchers who spend the least on discretionary products, and resistant to marketing.

* As you might expect given variations in social media usage globally, Social Technographics scores also vary. For instance, in Asia, Indian and Chinese consumers living in metropolitan areas have the highest scores. Though South Korea is typically described as a ountry with heavy social media penetration and usage, Koreans has a lower average Social Technographics score. This is attributed to the popularity of the mobile message app KaKaoTalk.
* Social Technographics also provides scores by customer life cycle stage, to enable brands better choose objectives for social media marketing. Figure 2.5 illustrates a sample report based on the average scroes for online adults in the US.

* The **discover** socre measures the extent to which the target audience uses social media to learn about new brands as well as how likely they are to spread the word about their favorite products and services. High discover scores also reflect an openness to the experiences affored via social media. When marketing to a segment with high discover scores, the zones of social community, social publishing, and social entertainment are all viable.
* The **explore** score gauges whether social media can be used to create purchase intent. This number measures how actively your audience consumes social content when they're considering products and making purchase decisions. High explore scores suggest social media marketing tactics focused in Zone 2 and 4--the zones of social publishing and social commerce.
* The **buy** score tracks whether social media are likely to be used to make purchases. it measures how often your audience clicks a "buy" button on social sites. In other words, it measures the likelihood of conversation using social media, the ultimate goal of the zone of social commerce. Forrester's research suggest that even peopel who are social stars are still resistent to completing transaction in social media.
* The **use** score measures whether social media can stimulate increasd product usage. It measures how common it is for a target segment to share product and service experiences, such as sharing what songs they're listening to on Spotify or comparing their workouts to that of other Fitbit users. When use scores are high, brands can benefit from organic word-of-mouth communication and encourage the audience to contribute brand-related UGC and reviews and ratings--levaraging the zones of social community, social publishing, and social commerce.
* The **ask** score reflects whether social media are a valued channel for customer support. It measures how commonly the segment turns to social media for help using the proudcts and services they buy, such as asking for help on Twitter or looking up how-to videos on youtube. When ask scores are high, the zones of social community, social publishing, and social commerce are useful.
* The **engage** score gauges whether social media will be useful to build custoemr relationships. It measures the target segment's use of social media to connect with their favorite brands (i.e., their lovemarks). High engage scores suggest social media marketing strategies that include the zone of social community.

## THE SOCIAL CONSUMPTION/CREATION MATRIX
* Another segmentation framework, the Social Consumption/Creation Matrix, categorizes social media user types according to their degree of social media consumption and creation. While a more simplistic representation of social media users, the framework effectively captures the dual roles of creation and consumption. Consumption of social media content is the most prevalent activity but must be served by the more taxing creation of content. While brands and media publish social media content, research suggests that social media users have a proclivity for content created by other users. Considering user propensity, from low to high, for content creation and consumption reulsts in a four-segment matrix, depicted in Figure 2.6. 1) attention seekers, 2) devoteees, 3) entertainment chasers, and 4) connection seekers.

                FIGURE 2.6: The Social Consumption/Creation Matrix
                Suggested Tactics by User Type

                Creation:low; Consumption: low:
                        Entertainment Chasers: Advergaming, Contests, Quizzes

                Creation: High; Consumption: Low:
                        Attention Seekers: "Celebrity" Endorsers

                Creation: Low; Consumption: High
                        Connection Seekers: Groups, Events

                Creation High; Consumption: High:
                        Devotees:Brand ambassadors, UGC generators.

* **Attention seekers** have large networks, high social capital, and the ability to create and promote social content. These are the social media influencers we discussed earlier in the chapter--regular people whose social media activities have created a celebrity-like following for them. They are motivated by validation impulse and are ready to participate in conspicuous, brand-initiated interaction.
* **Devotees** are ideal brand ambassadors, because they want to interact with brands and are eager to share their opinions. Like attention seekers, they are talented content creators, but because devotees are also active content consumers, other social media users may perceive them as more authentic and genuine.
* **Entertainment chasers** are characterized by a low level of both creation and consumption. These are passive users with short attention spans who restrict their investments of time and effort unless there is a reward offered as an incentive. They respond best to social media marketing efforts in the zone of social entertainment, including videos, quizzes, pools, and games.
* **Connection seekers** are the largest segment of social media participants. They make up the foundation of any social community. Though they are low content creators, their ongoing engagement is critical to the health of social communities. Motivated by the affinity impulse, connection seekers want to socialize and build relationships. For brands, the social media marketing activities associated with teh zone of social community wil be most effective for nurturing connection seekers.

* The Social Consumption/Creation Matrix provides clear guidance to marketers given the characteristics of each segment. The framework is based on research conducted among Facebook users, but clearly the implications are valuable across social channels.

## A TYPOLOGY OF SOCIAL UTILITY
* Researchers from Ryerson University in Toronto took a different approach to categorizing social media segemnts, employing user propensity to socialize and seek information in social media communities. By categorizing social media users into **passive or active information seekers and passive or active participants, four segments were identified, as shown in Figure 2.7; 1) Minimalists, 2) Info seekers, 3) Socializers, and 4) Mavens.** Brands must interact socially in the zone of social community to target Socializers and Mavens, and actively provide content (content marketing in the zone of social publishing) for Info Seekers and Mavens. Minimalists are the least engaged, presumably because thir needs for affiliation and information are lower than those of the other segments.

## MICROBLOG USER TYPES
* Microblogs like Twitter are thought to differ from other social networks. Members may seek to align by interests rather than relationships. The patterns go even deeper though, as Pew Research Center found in its study of Twitter topic networks. It discovered six specific archetypes of social media participation in its analysis of Twitter conversation:

1. Polarized crowds
2. Tight crowds
3. Brand clusters
4. Community clusters
5. Broadcast networks
6. Support networks

* The two most critical for marketers are brand clusters and support networks, but before we get into that, let's take a look at the meaning of each archetype. Polarized crowds are people who are passionately discussing an issue. There are two sides and people do not cross the party lines. Tight crowds are characterized by high interconnected people such as hobbyists, fans, or pofessional groups. Brand clusters are talking about brands but the people talking are not talking with each other. Community clusters typically feature news relevant to specific groups. Broadcast networks exist when many people repeat prominent news. The news sources are the hub, but the news is spread through retweets. The support network is one in which customer compaints are handled by one or more members. It produces a hub-and-spoke structure but the numbers are larged disconnected. Brand clusters are relevant for social media marketers because these conversations are occuring around brand topics. There is an opportunity to engage. The support network archetype is relevant to brand seeking to use social media as a customer service channel.

### CASE STUDY
221BC's SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING
* In Chapter 1, we met 221BC and its owners, Aneta and Eric Lundquist, 221BC is a family-owned company offering a high-quality kombucha with unique flavors. The company is committed to developing a social media marketing strategy to facilitate accomplishing several marketing objectives. In this chapter, we take a closer look at 221BC's target audience.
* Given the many health benefits of kombucha, it may seem like it should target a mass market. Everyone wants to healthier, right? While that's tempting, marketers know that marketing is most effective when we strategically design marketing, efforts to meet the needs and characterisitics of specific target markets. In Chapter 2, we learned the bases of segmentation used to group the marketing population into segments, from which we can choose target markets. Personas are developed to provide further insight into the motivations, behavioural patterns, and characteristics of the target markets. We also learned about motivations and behavioural patterns affecting social media participation, which can be useful when planning social media marketing campaigns.
* 221BC will want to target existing drinkers of kombucha and may also want to target non-drinkers who are likely to embrace kombucha once they try it and know its health benefits. So who drinks kombucha? Millennials have embraced kombucha. One study found that 51% of those between the ages of 25 and 34 drink kombucha, but other estimates suggest only 14% of the US population has tried kombucha. Another found that kombucha consumers are typically concerned with buying local and sustainably produced products, even more so than they are concerned with cost. They choose kombucha for its probiotics, flavor, and taste. Even though kombucha drinkers re driven by its health nenefits, they tend to prioritize convenience and accessbility over local, fresh brews. They are open to trying new things and pay attention to health trends. Kombucha drinkers also tend to have a healthy lifestyle with interests in sustainability and social good and fitness activities like yoga.
* Women make up the prime demographic target audience for the global kombucha market. This is connected to a rise in health consciousness as well as increased spending power for women around the world. Women today tend to focused on fitness, healthy eating, and weight loss and this has all contributed to increased sales of kombucha and the overall strength of the kombucha market.
* 221BC has created some elements of a target person which it calls The Conscious Foodie, described in Figure 2.8. In terms of demographics, this market is between the ages of 18 and 54 (with a sweet spot of 30-54), college-educated, and middle- to upper-class income. Psychographically, the target market is active in outdoor sports, a heavy user of digital and social media, strives for a healthy lifestyle, appreciates good design, and is willing to pay more for quality. She likes to try new experiences and she' curious and open to different cultures. 221BC's geographic market is currently limited to Florida Eand other major city markets but it is planning expansion in the near future. The benefits sought include an alternative to sodas, an alternative to alcoholic beverages, a beverage that provides energy detox, and healthy probiotics.

                The conscious foodie
                        * Demographics: Female, may have children, 18-54, College educated, upper middle class
                        * Psychographics: Active and enjoy the outdoors, digitally connected, strives to live a healthy lifestyle, willing to pay more for quality, appreciate good design

## COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
* Through infrastructure, channels, devuices, and social software make social media possible, it's people like you that make it a living, breathing part of everyday life. Social media are first and foremost about community: the collective participation of members who together create value. Defining exactly what an online community is and what it isn't has been difficult task for researchers. Thwrough different approach exist, we'll refer to online communities as a group of people who come together for a specific purpose, who are guided by community policies, and who are supported by an online vehicle or host that enables virtual communication among members.
* In some ways, online communities are not much different from those we find in our physical environment. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online version, of course) defines community as "a unified body of individuals, unified by interest, location, occupation, common history, or political and economic concerns." In fact, one social scientist refers to an online community as a cyberspace where "people connect online with kindred spirits, engage in supportive and sociable relationships with them, and imbue their activity online with meaning, belonging , and identity".
* Community participation is facilitated online by sites that serve as hosts or vehicles (the second layer of infrastructure in the Social Media Value Chain we covered in Chapter 1) for communication and collaboration between members. These hosts, whether social network sites, forums, or message boards, proide a virtual space--a cyberplace--and functionality to support member connectivity and participation in one or more of the zones of social media. Chances are you are already using Facebook and other host sites like these!

                * Qzone
                * Taringa
                * Sina Weibo
                * VK
                * Youku

* Across all four zones, the value of social media is tied to network effects and group influence. For this reason, we cover the structural elements of networks, the creation and flow of content, and the sources of influence in social communities as a foundation. We'll also explore the rise of influencer marketing.

## NETWORKS: THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF COMMUNITIES
* When we first presented the Social Media Vlaue to you, we emphasize that all of social media are networked. Though we'll talk more in the next chapter (and throughout the text) about social network sites, in fact all social communities are networks of social networks. Social network sites--defined as "networked communication platforms in which participants 1) have uniquely identifiable profiles that consist of user-supplied content, content provided by other users, and/or system-provided data; 2) can publicly articulate connections that can be viewed and traversed by others; and 3) can consume, produce, and/or interact with streams of user-generated content provided by their connections on the site"--serve as the most prevalent form of host in social media. Networks underlie the premise of social media and the network effect is key to understanding the value of social communities for social media marketing. The network effect explains that the relative value a community offers its members is tied to its membership. Before we move on, let's cover the basics of social network theory, the theory that explains how networks (whether online or off) work.

## SOCIAL NETWORKS
* A **social network** is a set of socially relevant nodes connected by one or more relations. Nodes are members of the network (whom we also refer to as network units). When we think of community we tend to think of people, but members of a network can be organizations, articles, countries, departments, or any other definable unit. A good example is your university alumni association. Members are connected by their relationships (or ties) with each other. Relationships are based on various affiliations such as kinship, friendship and affective ties, shared experiences, professional relationships, and shared hobbies and interests. They may be reciprocal or unidirectional. Friend, follower, fan, link, and contact are all terms used to denote relationship connections in social communities.
* Social networks can be diagrammed to illustrate the interconnections of network units. Figure 3.1 illustrates a visual representation of a member's social network showing the nodes, ties, and relationship strength. Circles in the image represent nodes (members of Linkedin) who are connected via ties. Linkedin also supplies information on degrees of separation between members. People with direct connection are separated by one degree. A friend of a friend has a two degree separation, and so on.
* How many degrees of separation are you from your favorite movie star or most admired business leader? Six degrees or less. That's the concept known as the six degrees of separation--the idea that anyone on Earth is connected to anyone else in just six steps or less. So through just five other people or less, you're effectively connected to anyone and everyone--whether those people are the Queen of England, Mark Zuckerberg, or Cristiano Ronaldo. The theory originated from a 1929 short story called "Chains", by Frigyes Karinthy in which one of the characters challenges the others to find another person on Earth that he can not connect himself to through fewer than five intermediaries, but was't tested scientifically until decades later. Based on the math, the concept is plausible. "Assuming everyone konws at least 44 people, and that each of those people knows an entirely new 44 people, and so on, the maths shows that in just six steps everyone could be connected to 44^6, or 7.26 billion people--more than are alive on Earth today". But we owe the real breakthrough in scientific support for the thoery to a college game called "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"
* Connected nodes in a network experience interactions; these are behaviour-based ties such as talking with each other, attending an event together, or working together. If you have a conversation on Twitter, you are a node engaging in an interaction with another node. These interactions create flows among connected nodes.

## FLOW: HOW IDEAS TRAVEL ONLINE
* Flow are exchanges of resources, information, or influence among members of the network. For example, on Facebook you share news, updates about your life, opinions on favorite books and movies, photos, videos, and notes. As you share content, you create flows among those in your network. In social media these flows of communication go in many directions at any point in time and often on multiple platforms--a condition called media multiplexity. Flows are not simply two wayor three way, they may involve an entire community, a list of group within a network, or several individuals independently.
* Flows of communication also occur outside the community platform. While the online community exists within a web space, the flows of communication may extend to other domains such as emails, text messages, virtual worlds, and even face-to-face meetup where members of an online network arrange to meet in a physical location. Increasingly we find that social connections online result in face-to-face connections offline. For marketers, flows are especially important because they are the actionable components of any social network system in terms of the sharing of information, delivery of promotional materials, and sources of social influence. Word-of-mouth communication flows from node to node. Whether the flow changes behavior or attitudes depends on the social influecne of the initiating node. The extent of social influence (where one person's attitudes or behaviour change as a result of others attempts) varies depending upon the power of attractiveness of other nodes. We'll take a deep look at influence and how someone develops it later in the chapter.
* Earlier we saw that social communities are built on networks, and these networks include nodes that are connected by ties through which content and experiences flow. The nodes of influencers are valuable because of the large number of people they can reach with their social power. Understanding what flows occured and how extensively the flows were disseminated thorugh influencers was first based on a framework called the **two-step flow model of influence**. more recent research has tweaked that basic idea; now it suggests that influence can be driven both by influencers and by interactions among those who are easily influenced. These people communicate the information vigorously to one another and also participate in a two-way dialogue with the opinion leader as part of an influence network. These conversations create cascades of information which occur when a piece of information triggers a sequence of interactions (much like an avalanche), as Figure 3.2 shows.
* A message originates at Level 1 and is sent by the influencer to his or her contacts (level 2). The message may travel on from some level 2 contacts to their contacts (Level 3), and so on. With the ease of sharing via social media, the power of the network effect, and the flow of influence, word-of-mouth communication can spread with or without influencers.

## THE VIRAL SPREAD OF SOCIAL CONTENT
* When content, whether a simple opinion, video, or trend, spreads through social networks rapidly, we say that it has gone viral. Viral content may or may not be branded, but it will be content that a large number of people in one or more social communities deemed relevant, valuable, or just plain too bizarre not to share with friends. Those community members then influenced the spread of the content by altering it, sharing it with their own social graphs (for social networks), and participating in word-of-mouth (WOM) communication about the content. 
* When viral content evolves within a social community, it becomes a meme. A meme is a snippet of cultural information that spreads person to person and is adapted until eventually it enters the general consciousness. These snippets may include songs, phrases, ideas, slang words, fashion trends, or shared behaviours. An example of a meme is that of the millions of Baby Yoda images found across social media!
* It's easy to understand how a meme spreads if you use the medical analogy of a virus; memes spread among consumers in a geometric progression, just as a virus starts off small and steadily infects increasing numbers of people until it becomes an epidemic. The leap from person to person occurs as people share and imitate the meme. The memes that survive over time tend to distinctive and memorable. The most enduring ones evoke earlier memes that may relate to legends and well-known stories and tales. For example, the Star Wars movies evoke prior memes that relate to the legend of King Arthur, religion, heroic youth, and 1930s adventure serials.
* Memes have even inspired their own community on Reddit called the Meme Economy , in which memes are discussed using stock market jargon. It ispired a website, where memes were bought, sold, or held like stocks in a stock market. The buy/sell trades served as an indicator of a meme's future spread.

### EXHIBIT 3.2
VIRAL CONTENT INSPIRES MEMES
* A recent example of viral content is the so-called "kombucha girl" whose experience and reaction to drinking kombucha for the first time spread from TikTok to Twitter and Instagram. In the TikTop clip, Brittany Tomlinson tastes kombucha and shares her reactions including curiosity, uncertainty, disgust, enjoyment, consideration, and laughter! The sequence of facial expressions was so relatable, the video swiftly turned into one of the most well-known reaction memes of 2019. Tomlinson told Vulture about her kombucha experience, saying, "Will I try kombucha again? Probably. Will I like it? Probably not. Will I keep drinking it? Yes most likely."

RICKROLLING: A CLASSIC MEME
* Have you ever clicked on an exciting link or potentially explosure news story, only to find yourself watching the 1987 Rick Astley hit "Never Gonna Give You Up?" Then you've been rickrolled, my friend. A classic bait-and-switch scenario, the meme is as popular now as it's ever been. The first rickroll happened in 2007 when visitors to the Youttube Trailer for the vidoe game Grand Theft Auto IV were instead served Astley's video. Youtube got in on the fun itself one April Fool's Day when the site rickrolled every user who viewed a clip on its homepage. Since then million of people have been rickrolled. See Higgin (2014) for some of the best examples (including one by the White House Twitter account)

## WORD OF MOTH (WOM
* When the information sprread via flow is product information shared node-to-node, person-to-person, it is called **word-of-mouth communication**. Despite all of the money marketers pump into lavish ads, WOM is far more powerful: it influences two-thirds of all consumer goods sales. In one survey, 69% of intervewees said they relied on a personal referral at least once over the course of a year to help them choose a restaurant, 36% reported they used referral to decide on computer hardware and software, and 22% got help from friends and associates to decide where to travel. 
* If you think carefully about the content of your own conversations in the course of a normal day, you will probably agree that much of what you discuss with friends, family members, or co-workers is product related; when you compliment someone on her dress and ask her where she bought it, recommend a new restaurant to a friend, or complain to your neighbor about the shoddy treatment you got at the bank, you engage in WOM.
* Marketers have been aware of the power of WOm for many years, instead of sitting back and hoping more aggressive about trying to promote and control it, instead of sitting back and hoping people will like their products enough to talk them up. The ease of sharing WOm vai social media and other digital channels is a key reason. Companies such as BzzAgent, an everyday influencer marketing compnay (www.bzzagent.com), have thousands of online "agents" who try new products and spread the word about those they like. And many sophisticated marketers today also precisely track WOM.

### EXHIBIT 3.4
ENGAGEMENT LABS MEASURES WOM ONLINE AND OFF
* With word-of-mouth conversation driving $6 trillion in annual consumer spending, marketers need to know what people are saying. Online conversations are important, but offline conversations are too. Engagement Labs' TotalSolution combines in-depth social listening with comprehensive offline conversation measurement tools, delivering a TotalSocial scorecard in 17 major industry categories.

===

* According to the report "Hearing the Voice of the Consumer: UGC and the Commence Experience," online word-of-mouth communication is the most preferred source for 90% of shoppers making a purchase. It even outranked search engines and promotional emails and was so valuable for some that they are willing to pay more and wait longer for shipping for products that are organically endorsed by others. Online WOM consistently correlates with sales in empirical studies, but its influence varies. When shared via social media, it tends to be more influential when those exposed to the message believe they are similar to the person sharing the information. In contrast, similarity doesn't seem to play a role in the relative influence of online WOM on ecommerce platforms. It is also more influential when products are novel, rather than well established in the market.
* Keep in mind that word of mouth can be a double-edged sword for marketers. Just as positive WOM can enhance attitudes and sales, negative WOM can harm. Furthermore, consumers weigh **negative word of mouth** more heavily than they do positive comments. According to a study by the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, 90% of unhappy customers will not do business with a company again. Each of these customers is likely to share his or her grievance with at least nine other people, and 13% tell more than 30 people about their negative experience.
* Over time, negative WOm has increased relative to positive WOM such that there is a higher volume of negative messages online. Reach is also potentially high because social media allow users access to many others, even beyond their own network, because of the cascading flow of information--though, research suggests that the valence of WOM shared may depend upon the interpersonal relationship between sender and receiver. When interpersonal closeness is high, negative WOM is more likely to be shared; when low, positive WOM is more likely. The research suggests that the effect is due to high interpersonal closeness activating the goal to protect others, and low interpersonal closeness activating the goal to enhance the self.
* These brand-specific conversations also have value in terms of their media equivalent, known as the **ad equivalency value**. In other words, when brands use paid media, they have an estimate of the value of the advertising in the form of the fees they paid to place the ads. But in social media, most of our promotional value comes from earned and owned media. Therefore, we may try to establish a value and relate that value to the cost of buying equivalent paid media. This is the meaning of ad equivalence value--what would the value of the mention be if it had come through a paid advertising placement rather a volunteered comment?
* Forrester Research labels these brand-specific mentions "influence impressions" We generate influence impressions whenever we discuss brands openly online. In advertising lingo, an **impression** refers to a view or an exposure to an advertising message. In social media, brands may benefit from influence impressions as well as ad impressions. An **influence impression** is an exposure to a brand via another person--in other words, it's the impressions that are generated through social sharing. Forrester estimates that billions of influence impressions are generated as people talk about their lives with each other, telling stories and experiences that invariably include brands. We also see influence impressions in the form of online reviews, which we cover in depth in Chapter 9. Further, the brand activity in the social media space, whether in the form of tweeting, blogging, social networking, or virtual commerce, encourages people to incorporate this information into their own communication exchanges.

## THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ONLINE COMMUNITIES
* All communities, whether they exist online or in the physical world, share important characteristics: participants experience a feeling of membership, a sense of proximity to one another (even though in online groups other members' physical selves may be thousands of miles away), and in most cases some interest in the community's activities. Social network sites, and other social vehicles, provide value for community memebers by establishing a virtual location and the functionality needed for memebers to connect, communicate, and collaborate.

## PRESENCE
* Though online communities exist virtually rather than a physical location, the better ones supply tangible characteristics that create the sensation of actually being in a place. This is particularly true for virtual world communities that include three-dimensional depictions of physical spaces, but it also applies to visually simplistic online communities such as message board groups. **Presence** refers to the effect that people experience when they interact with a computer-mediated or computer-generated environment. Social media sites enhance a sense of presence when they make the environment look and feel real.

## PURPOSIVE VALUE AND SOCIAL OBJECTS
* Virtual communities do not develop and thrive without a foundation of commonality among the members. Just as your offline communities revolve around family, religious beliefs, social activities, hobbies, goals, place of residence, and so on, your online communities also need commonalities to create bonds among the members. These groups come together to allow people to share their passions, whether for indie bands, white wines, or open-source apps. Community content (whether simple dialogue, shared recipes, event photos, or something else entirely) is generated, shared, consumed, fortified, and promoted by community memebers. The contributions of memebers add value for the general memebership group. 
* **Social object theory** suggest that social networks will be more effective if there is a way to activate relationships among people and objects. In this perspective an object is something of common interest and its primary function is to mediate the interactions between people. All relationships have social objects embedded in the relationship. In the online world, a site such as Facebook provides venues for several object formats to ensure that relationships can  thrive within the site's framework. One factor that drives Facebook's stunning success is that it offers so many objects for users to share; these include photos, live video, events, quizzes, and so on. Memes are a type of social object.
* Other social network sites provide a more specialized or focused set of objects. For example, consider how each of the following SNS incorporates objects as part of its mission. On Instagram users participate because they want to share photos, stories, and videos. These images are the objects that give meaning to the platform and motivate people to visit.

### EXHIBIT 3.5
DOGSTER AND SOCIAL OBJECT THEORY
* Social object theory explains that shared objects give meaning to a social vehicle and motivate memeber engagement. On Diigo, the objects are URLs. On Yelp, the objects are businesses. On Dogster, the objects are our canine companions. On Whisper, secrets are the object.

===

* **Object sociality**, the extent to which users can share an object in social media, clearly relate to an audience's unique interests. It ties the site relationships to a specific object such as photo of people's dogs or bookmarked websites that provide details about the history of alternative music. The audience becomes specialized, at least to a degree. Importantly, though, SNS oriented around object sociality are likely to be passion-centric. That is, the people who join those communities probably not only share an interest in the object. We all know people who devote countless hours to a hobby or who (to an outsider) seem insanely obsessed about the fine details of Star Wars characters, vintage wines, or warring guilds in World or Warcraft.
* In industry terms, vertical networks are sites designed around object sociality. The term refers to the narrow, deep focus of SNS that differentiate themselves because they center on some common hobby, interest, or characteristic that draws memebers to the site. These vertical networks do not attract the same traffic typical of general sites, but one might argue that the memebers are more involved because of the common interest that initially brought them to the site. They function much like so-called niche markets in the physical world. The term niche refers to marketplaces that offer a relatively small number of items to buyers who tend to be loyal to these outlets (e.g., big-and-tall men's stores or tandem bicycles built for two).

## STANDARD OF BEHAVIOUR
* Communities help memebers meet their needs for affiliation, resource acquisition, entertainment, and information. Above all else, communities are active! Whether online or offline, they thrive when the members participate, discuss, share, and interact with others as well as recruit new memebers to the community. Virtual communities need norms, or rules that govern behaviour, in order to operate effectively. Some of these rules are spelled out explicitly (such as when you agree to the terms of use when joining various SNS) but many of them are unspoken. In general, **norms** are mental representations of appropriate behaviour in a community. Social norms are created, shared, and sustained by community members because they promote behaviour that benefits the collective. Without these rules, wee would have chaos. Imagine the confusion if a simple norm in the offline world such as stopping for a red traffic light did not exist!
* In social communities, memebers learn norms through socialization. For instance, researchers attempting to explain the prevalence of aggression expressed online, including vulgarity, insults, bullying, slander, and trolling, found the expressed aggression was more common in social communities in which peer comments were also aggressive. Some of the more prevalent forms of aggression are flaming, doxing, and trolling. **Flaming** refers to posts written with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS TO EXPRESS ANGER. Doxing, a cyber offence that is illegal in the UK, refers to identifying and publishing private information about someone as a form of punishment or revenge.
* Trolling refers to the deliberate provocation of conflict by posting messages that are inflammatory, controversial, insulting, and/or provocative. Trolls are not your average social media user taking advantage of an opportunity to vent or complain. They are online bullies; trolling is a hobby to them, Michael Brutsch, a Reddit troll, is an example. Using the handle ViolentTacrez, Brutsch created offensive subreddits (topics groups on Reddit) with the goal of enraging other Reddit users. Some of the sections Violentacrez created were Chokeabitch, Rapebait, Misogyny, and Jailbait. Unfortunately for marketers, it's become a popular game among troll to bait brands.  If they succeed in eliciting an emotional response, they screenshot it and post it. Whether a marketer or an individual unlucky enought to be the target of a troll, experts recommend ignoring the troll unless the attacks become sufficiently severe to warrant reporting the troll to the social community and blocking the troll.
* As you can see, some norms prevent negative behaviours that are pretty minor; others relate to more serious matters. And while norm enforcement is typically thought of as sactions against community memebers, social media make it possible for communities to attempt sanction against people and businesses beyond the community, as in the case of shaming and online firestorms. David Brooks, a writer for the New York Times, explains that shaming, attempting to make people feel bad by posting many negative comments, marks a shift in the culture of social communities. It the past, people would recognize their bad behaviour by the guilt felt by their conscience. Now, Brooks claims, people are expected to respond to teh voice of the community.
* In addition to social norms, standards of behaviour may also be influenced by anonymity and by explicit agreeements between the community and individual memebers. Open access sites enable anyone to participate without registration or identification. This can be valuable for participation on sensitive topics as well as for ease of use. However, open access also lower the barriers for misbehaviour because it ensures anonymity to users. Just as people tend to "act out" at a costume party when no one knows who they really are, visitors to these sites may post things they might avoid if others knew their real identity. The social contract is the agreement that exists between the host of governing body and the memebers. You engage in a social contract when you indicate agreement to a "term of use" clause for a site. Social contracts set forth expectations for user behaviour as well as for the host of governing body. Some sites such as Facebook, however, come under fire when they make changes to the social contract without user input. The specific concern is typically for the protection of membership privacy.

## GROUPS AND SUBCULTURES
* Within a social community, groups and subculture can thrive. We've seen this since thee early days of research on virtual communities and into the present with the many netnographic studies of niche groups. These communities and subcultures have always existed but often remained on the fringe, unable to reach a critical mass due to logistical inaccessbilitiy to like-minded others. Social media enable these once remote subcultures to network and collaborate. The result is flourishing crowdcultures around almost any topic: anime, minimalism, paleo diets, marathon runners, libertarianism, and more. The potential influence of these communities is illustrated by the phenomenon of crowdsourcing, when tasks are completed collaboratively by a large group of people such that the resulting value far exceeds that which could have been contributed by any single participant.
* members affiliate with communities with which they identify, but the source of commality could be anything--a mission, location, interest, characteristic, and so on. The choice to affiliate is tied to one's social identity, which we introduced in Chapter 2. Social identity is that part of an individual's self-concept that is related to group memebership and it helps us to understand participation in social communities. Participation can be thought of as **intentional social action** in the context of a group. Described as "well-intentions", participation is influenced both by individual attitudes and characteristics and the context and norms of the group.

## PARTICIPATION
* Community members seek out ways to be connected. The site encourages new memebers to connect. It's critical to encourage participation among new memebers; these contributions continue to build the value of the platform for all members. If a social media site starts to lose visitors, it resembles a deserted mining town in the Old West--empty saloons, banks, and stores with (digital) tumbleweed blowing across the streets.
* Your level of participation is based on a mix of four elements: **1) the people with whom you are connected, 2) the content (called artifacts) you produce on the site, 3) the feedback you receive from others, 4) and the distribution of the artifacts and feedback throughout the network.** Of these, the biggest predictor of whether someone will become active in a social network space, regardless of the site's primary function, is the presence of a critical mass of friends. If your friends are present and active in the space, you probably will be too because you will have someone with whom to interact and to reward you for your participation.
* Of these four elements of social network site participation, three are dependent upon the nodes in your network. If your contacts are not active in your experience, your own activity in the network will be stunted because you won't have people with whom to interact, you won't receive sufficient feedback, and your content will not be redistributed. Some nodes will have more connections than others and some will take part in more interactions. These nodes will tend to have greater influence in the network. We'll talk more about influence later in this chapter. Interactions are participative in nature--they are shared activities among members in the network.
* For an online community to thrive, a significant proportion of its members must participate. Otherwise the site will fail to offer fresh material and ultimately traffic will slow. In addition to its importance in community health, participation fuels engagement--the ultimate desired state of being in social media (and a topic we cover more in Chapter 4). The meaning of engagement has been the focus of great scrunity among marketing scholars. Engagement as "a psychological state that occurs through interactive, co-creative consumer experiences with a focal agent/object" highlights the role of participation (in interctive, co-creative experiences) and the context (in this case, the social community). Participation can be a challenge, though, because most users are lurkers, people who review site content but don't actually contribute. Researchers estimate that only 1% of a typical community's users regularly participate and another 9% do only intermittently. The remaining 90% just observe what's on the site, so they don't add a lot of value--other than adding to the number of "eyeballs" the site can claim when it tries to convince advertisers to buy space.
* Sound familiar? This diaparity roughly parallels the larger pattern we often observe in marketing contexts called th 80/20 rule--that roughly 80% of the product is bought by 20% of a brand's users. Marketers label these faithful "heavy users". In many groups or consumer segments, a relative handful of people account for most of the activity; this hard-core group is often the most valuable for organizations to touch because they are the real movers and shakers. Thus, a person's participation is influenced by 20% or less of their network. What do the most effective communities do to promote participation? According to Platform Revolution three factors are responsible: 1) magnetism (i.e., members are attracted to the community and vice versa), 2) user-generated content (members are proactive in contributing content), and 3) value creation (by participating memebers co-create value, thus improving the experience)

## SOCIAL CAPITAL
* When people form community relationships, these affiliations allow them to accumulate resources that they can "trade" for other things. In the offline business world, we clearly see how this process works in the golf subculture. Although many people do love to hit that ball around, the reality is  that a lot of business is transacted on the course and executives profit from their membership of this community (some business schools even offer academic courses on "golf etiquette"!).
* We call these resources **social capital** because their value lies in providing access to others. The resources may be actual or virtual, and they may be held by a group of an individual. For instance, they might include useful information, relationships, the ability to organize groups, employment connections, and more. Do you know anyone who landed a job interview due to the intervention of a friend of a friend? This is an example of social capital at work--especially since jobseekers who know larger numbers of people who already work at high-level jobs are more likely to be able to trade on these connections. Social capital tends to be a limited and protected resource. To return to the golf example, at many country clubs it's not enough just to rolling in money: you also need to be recommended by current members so that the organization controls (fairly or not) just who gets to hobnob on the links and in the locker room.
* Typically, a community is healthier and more desirable when it is able to offer a lot of social capital as an inducement for people to join. Communities build capital through reputation and structure. **Reputational capital** is based on the shared beliefs, relationships, and actions of those in the community such that norms, behaviours, and values held and shared by individuals ultimately support a community reputation. You can think of this like a big, beefy nightclub bouncer who decides whom he will admit past the velvet rope. In fact, like exclusive country clubs, online gated communities that selectively allow access to only some people may offer a high degree of social capital to the lucky few who pass the test.

### EXHIBIT 3.6
RAYA MEMBERS HAVE SOCIAL CAPITAL
* RAYA, an exclusive dating network, is an example of an online gated community that carefully curates memebers to weed out the unattractive. Described as "Tinder for famous people", applicants are screened using selection criteria including Instagram followers, personal recommendation, and individual characteristics (think looks, creativity, and income)

===

* How does online social capital work? Netowkr size, memeber activity, activity quality indicators such as network feedback like number of "favorites", and information flows from a member through his or her network serve as variables that influence one's social capital. Network size is a variable because it promotes the viability of the network we discussed in Chapter 1 and the chance that content will cascade through the community. Member activity reveals the importance of participation. Quality indicators and information flow serve as evidence of value and relevance. All of  this is based on community participation. If and when people participate less in a given social community, the social capital of influencers in that community will diminish as well. As social capital declines, the community experiences decline in its own strength as measured by participation, adherence to norms, perceived reputation, and trust among members. Hopefully you can see that influencers in a community have a lot at stake in keeping the community active and even growing it. In fact, influencers are concerned that Instagram's decision to hide "likes" on posts will har their social capital.
* Interestingly, this is the very phenomenon researchers at Princeton University used to predict the ultimate demise of Facebook. Just as we discussed the way viral content spreads like a disease, we can also view community participation and memebership much like the spread of infection. Using data on the adoption and abandonment of memberships and activity in MySpace, the study built a model using Google Trend data on social network search queries. The model suggested that social networks follow a life cycle (much like a product life cycle) through which social communities will grow, mature, and ultimately decline. The prediction that Facebook would lose 80% of its active members went viral, and Facebook researchers responded with their own study of Princeton enrollment. Using data from Google Scholar and a similar approach to modeling, Facebook's team built a model illustrating that Princeton would lose all student enrollments by 2021. Given the low probability of the latter prediction, Facebook was able to humourously debunk the Princeton study. Nonetheless, it is true that Facebook's meteoric growth is stablizing, espeically as many young people abandon it in favor of more private networks like Snapchat and for "dark social" options like texting.

### EXHIBIT 3.7
IS FACEBOOK'S FUTURE UNCERTAIN?
* Although billions of people worldwide love to share on Facebook, not everyone wants details about their private lives to be available to lurkers (especially to curious parents). In recent years sites like SnapChat that delete posts after a certain amount of time have gained in popularity. Marketers are also less committed to Facebook. For the first time in the last 5 years, Facebook lost share as the most important platform for marketers, dropping from 67% in 2018 to 61% in 2019. One in ten marketers indicated they'll be decreasing their organic marketing on Facebook. What do you predict to be the future of Facebook?

===

### STRONG AND WEAK TIES
* Emotional support is one form of social capital. For example, people who struggle to lsoe weight or fight addictions often prevail because they are part of a group that helps them with these battles, such as Weight Watchers or Alcoholic Anonymous. We call this kind of emotional support **bonding social capital**.
* This resource easily accrues online because of our accessbility to peopel who can help us with a variety of issues even though we may not know them personally. In contrast, our **core ties**, those people with whom we have very close relationships, may or may not be in a position to provide solutions to some problems we face (or we may not want them to know about these in some cases). Interestingly, through the course of giving and receiving bonding social capital, we may come to develop core ties, or at least **significant ties** (somewhat close connections, but less so than core ties), with others in the community.
* Online communities can also provide other kinds of support. This is particularly true of those that increase the accessbilitiy of so-called **weak-ties**. This term refers to contacts with people where your relationship is based on superficial experiences or very few connections. For instance, you have a **strong tie** with your best friend. Perhaps you and she went to high school together and so you have a history of shared experiences and friendships from your past. You then attended college classes together and again you were able to share experiences. You also joined the same sorority so you are bound by your relationship in the context of the organization. In this relationship, there are at least three connection sterams between you and your friend that extend several years and multiple shared experiences--we'd say this is a fairly strong tie.
* In contrast, you likely have weak ties among your Facebook friends, many of whom are just causal acquaintances or even friends of a friend whom you've never met. Weak ties may also be more prevalent when someone is connected to several otehrwise dispersed networks of people. In other words, rather than being central in a few tightly connected networks, the person serves as a node in several relatively unconnected networks. However, we can assure you that weak ties also have value. They may provide **bridging social capital**, the value we get from others who provide access to places, people, or ideas we might not be able to get on our own.
* In fact, many of the connections we make on SNS are not active ties at all. Rather, they are **latent ties**: pre-existing connections that we've discarded. **Maintained social capital** refers to the value we get from maintaining relationships with latent ties. You've probalby heard your parents say they've reconnected with old high school friends on Facebook ("I can't believ how bald he is now!") This is a perfect example of latent ties--as we move through life, some people stay in our lives, but others lose relevance as we develop and change. SNS are valuable connectors for latent ties because they represent a low-involvement, low-effort channel to maintain these bonds. In fact, researchers discovered that college students use Facebook as a way to preseve their network of latent ties. Some of your high school friends may have chosen the same university you did. Others went elsewhere. With sites such as Facebook, you are easily able to stay in touch with these friends, despite the shift in lifestyle and geographic location. Those connection may come in handy if you visit an unfamiliar place or need to find a job.
* Note: earlier we talked about weak and strong ties in communities. Latent ties are not necessarily weak ties. Your BFF in the sixth grade was once a strong tie, but she might now be a latent one. Before the social media era, it's likely you would have just lost track of her unless you both happended to hobble into your 25th class reunion. Now, you can keep your old connections on the radar screen, even if you don't necessarily talk or write to them on a regular basis. SNS enable members to maintain relationships across tie types.

### EXHIBIT 3.8
INFLUENCER CASEY NEISTATE USED SOCIAL CAPITAL FOR GOOD
* Influencers can use their social capital for good. That's what happened when Casey Neistat, a Youtube with more than 5 million subscribers, used his daily vlog to ask for help on behalf of his friend, UPS driver and frequent guest, Marlan Frandlyn. Larlan had been paying his sister's medical expenses to treat her severe kidney disease personally but could no longer shoulder the burdern alone. Casey suggested a GoFundme campaign to crowdsource the needed money--$125,000.
* Watch Casey's plea here: youtu.be/nELmgVd0dWw
* Within a few hours, marlan's GoFundMe campaign was trending. Within four days, nearly 10,000 people from around the world had donated, exceeding the goal by several thousand dollars.

## THE RISE OF INFLUENCERS
* Although consumers get information from personal sources, they do not usually ask just anyone for advice about purchases. If you decide to buy a new sound system, you will most likely seek advice from a friend who knows a lot about this topic. This friend may own a sophisticated system, or may subscribe to specialized magazines such as Stereo Review and spend her free time browsing through electronic stores. However, you may have another friend who has a reputation for being stylish and who spends his free time reading Gentleman's Quarterly and shopping at trendy boutiques. You might not bring up your sound system problem with him, but you may take him with you to shope for a new fall wardrobe.
* **Opinion leaders** (also known as **influencers** or **power users** in some communities) are people who others view as knowledgeable sources of information. They have a strong communication network that gives them the ability to affect purchase decisions for a number of other consumers, directly and indirectly. **Five characteristics help to describe them: 1) activists, 2) connected, 3) impact, 4) active minds, and 5) trendsetters.** In other words, opinion leaders develop a network of people through their involvement in activities. They are active participants at work and in their communities. Their social networks are large and well developed. Others trust them and find them to be credible sources of information about one or more specific topics. They tend to have a natural sense of intellectual curiosity that may lead them to new sources of information.
* Because of their reach and ability to drive engagement with interesting content, influencers have become a sweetheart for social media marketing. According to a study by MediaKix, **80% of marketers find influencer marketing effective and 89% say the return on investment from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels.** Marketers are using influencer marketing to drive brand awareness, reach new audiences, and generate sales. Before we explore influencer marketing further, let's review the underlying characteristics of influencers.
* Opinion leaders exist in all social communities. It is a natural pattern for some members to be more active and to acquire positions of authority within a group, whether offline or online. The source of the influence itself, however, originates from the power bases an influencer may possess.
* How can someone acquire power? French and Raven identified in their classic article, **The Bases of Social Power", several sources of power individuals can accrue in organizations. These sources of power include the following:

* **Reward power**: one's ability to provide others with what they desire.
* **Coercive power**: the ability to punish others.
* **Legitimate power**: organizational authority based on rights associated with a person's appointed position.
* **Referent power**: authority through the motivation to identify with or please a person
* **Expert power**: recognition of one's knowledge, skills, and ability.
* **information power**: one's control over the folow and access to information

* Of course, marketers always want to identify opinion leaders and get them on their team. These people often are the linchpin in a communication strategy; once an opinion leader decides he or she loves your product, it's just a matter of time before others in that person's network hear about it as well. Thus for purchase decisions, opinion leaders are extremely valuable information sources due to their social power.

* They are technically competent so they possess expert power.
* They prescreen, evaluate, and synthesize product information in an unbiased way, so they possess knowledge power
* They are socially active and highly interconnected in their communities.
* They are likely to hold positions of leadership. As a result, opinion leaders often have legitimate power by virtue of their social standing.
* they tend to be similar to the consumer in terms of their values and beliefs, so they possess referent power. Note that although opinion leaders are set apart by their interest or expertise in a product category, they are more convincing to the extent that they are homophilous rather than heterophilous. **Homopilly** refers to the degree to which a pair of individual is similar in t erms of education, social status, and beliefs. Homophily can predict collaborative online relationships and connectivity, whether in professional collaborations like a new product development project or in reciprocal kindnesses among friends in an online network of musicians.
* Effective opinion leaders tend to be slightly higher in terms of status and educational attainment than those they influence, but not so high as to be in a different social class.
* Opinion leaders are often among the first to buy new products, so they absorb much of the risk. This experience reduces uncertainty for the rest of us who are not as courageous. Furthermore, whereas company-sponsored communications tend to focus exclusively on t he positive aspects of a product, the hands-on experience leaders make them more likely to impart both positive and negative information abour product performance. Thus, they are more credible because they have no "axe to grind".

* Opinion leaders in social communities are most likely to deliver these influence impressions: only 6.2% of social media users are responsible for about 80% of impressions. Forrester calls these influencers **mass connectors**, paying homage to Malcolm Gladwell's popular book The Tipping Point. Gladwell posits that three factors work to "tip" a trend, in other words to ignite interest in an idea, behaviour, or product: the law of the few, stickiness, and the power of context.

1. The law of the few proposes that three types of people help to spread viral messages:

                * **Maven** are people who are knowledgeable about many things
                * **Connectors** are people who know many people and communicate with them
                * **Salespeople** are people who influence others with their natural persuasive power.

2. If an idea is sticky, this means it has memorable impact and it stays with us for a long time. Indeed, web designers use the term "stickiness" to describe the extent to which a website captures people's interest so that they stay on the site for a long time.
3. Lastly, Gladwell acknowledges that ideas spread more easily when conditions are right--that's the power of context.

* Though opinion leaders exist in social communities, these communities have also given rise to a different type of influencer--the microcelebrity (also called microinfluencers). Microcelebrities build influence using a self-presentation technique that involves establishing a sense of intimacy with their audiences by sharing content in one or more social communities. Though these influencers are self-branding, the technique ensures they are perceived as authentic, transparent, and relevant. Compared to traditional celebrities, microcelebrities have smaller audiences; they are classified as social personalities with 1000 to 100,000 followers, but they often have higher engagement rates and more influence in their communities. Unlike traditional celebrities who may have large audiences across several social network sites, these influencers tend to specialize in one community. Over time, their audience can grow. Kayla Itsines, a fitness trainers from Australia, is an example. She regularly shares before and after photos of women who follow her fitness protocol, as well as training videos, and pictures of healthy food on Instagram. Her following is now in the several millions; even Time magazine heralded her positive influence motivating women to make better fitness choices as a "virtual movement.
* Figure 3.3 describes a few of the archetypes that characterize social media influencers and examples of the types of brands that work with each archetype. This won't be our only discussion of the role of influencers in social media marketing. Brands partner with influencers to seed campaigns, drive impressions, and increase the likelihood that campaign content will go viral.

## MINI CASE STUDY
INFLUENCER MARKETING
* Influencer marketing is one of the fasting growing strategies for marketers, and agencies like Linqia, Grapestory, and Everywhere have developed to match marketers and influencers and plan effective influencer campaigns. Influencers provide reach for marekters but there are other benefits as well. A study of marketers using influencers in campaigns revealed a plethora of reasons for the rising popularity of influencer marekting. When asked why they chose to work with influencers, 73% of participants noted that the influencers were relevant to their target audience, 72% wanted to leverage the influencers' authenticity and trusted voice, and 60% sought to spark audience engagement.
* Working with influencers is also an efficient way to create content for social media. Traditionally, brands pay professional content creators (e.g., photographers, videographers, writers) to produce content, whether it be a blog post, photo, video, how-to article, or recipe. This can be expensive and time consuming. When brands work with influencers, content is typically a part of the deal. According to the study, 50% of marketers pay influencers a flat rate to produce each piece of content, in the same way that they would engage a professional content producer. On average, this typically costs 2.6 times less than working with a professional for a similar output. It also allows the marketers to categorize the production as a "working spend" because the influencers are sharing the content with their audiences. **Working spend** is a term used to describe investments that reach the target audience such as advertising and event marketing. **Non-working spend** is any cost attributed to creating campaign assets, planning, or managing the campaign. Lacey Meece, strategist for Ragu, explained: "Something as simple as recipe ends up being an  excruciatingly long and expensive process when professional produced. First, we have to pick a product to feature, then hire a food scientist that charge a per recipe fee. Next, we bring in photographers and videographers to shoot the visuals. Working with influencers is far more efficient--they each have their own style and voice and can quickly churn out audience recipes, photos, and videos at scale". Ragu partnered with lifestyle influencer Dzung Duong of the popular Youtube channel Honeysuckle to develop recipes for its Homestyle line of sauces.
* Creating enough good content is a major challenge for social media marketers. Influencers add value by not only reaching more consumers but also creating content that can repurposed for use across a brand's social media channels. Most marketers are repurposing influencer-generated content: 84% post influencer content on the brand's organic social media accounts and 72% drive attention to the content using paid social media.
* Are influencers effective? Nestle's Gerber thinks so. When Gerber launched its Lil' Beanies product and wanted to drive awareness and trial in key markets through Publix, Target, Walmart, and Kroger, it chose influencers as a key part of the social media strategy. The navy-bean-based snack for toddlers has two grams of protein per serving, is non-GMO, and contains no artificial flavors or colors. The advertising budget for the product launch was small and the strategy needed to showcase the brand's alue proposition. Using mommy bloggers as influencers was the perfect solution.
* The hook? Lil' Beanies is a great snack for toddlers. Who were the influencers? Several influencers participated, including Kristy of Mommy Hates Cooking, Shannon of Mom Without Labels, and Susie of Not Quite Susie Homemaker. The bloggers clearly labeled the blog posts as sponsored but also shared their stories with the brand. As important as conveying the positive nutritional information was, the bloggers were able to illustrate that their kids like the snack. Check out their posts to see how the influencers promoted the product while staying true to their followers.
* Effective? We'd say so! The campaign resulted in a reach of more than 56 million impressions and 260,000 interactive engagements. It also produced more than 9,000 pieces of content that could be repurposed in Gerber's social media activities. The proudct achieved a 5% sales life during the campaign, suggesting that the campaign drove sales as well as awareness.

===

* In summary, influencer marketing will likely remain a key social media marketing approach well into the future. When selecting influencers, marketers use the following factors to choose the right influencers for their campaigns.

* Quality of content: 81%
* Target audience: 78%
* Engagement rate: 73%
* On-brand messaging or aesthetic: 56%
* Budget: 50%

## CRITICAL REFLECTION
CHALLENGES FACING INFLUENCER MAREKTING
* Influencer marketing may be today's social media darling, but it comes with challenges. In a study of influencer marketing challenges, MediaKix found that 50% of marketers were concerned about spotting fake followers, 49% worried about changes to the algorithms used by social network sites, 38% were pressured by the rising costs of influencers, 28% felt brand safety and alignment with influencers was an issue, and 18% worried about influencers breaking Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations and guidelines. Instagram has cracked down on third-party services that sell fake followers and inauthentic engagement, but concern over fake followers remain omnipresent. It's possible that companies remain skepitcal because Instagram has not disclosed the scope of third-party apps targeted in the update and because the platform has been caught selling ad space to the same follower-buying services that it banned.
* Influencer fraud occurs when an influencer falsifies estimates of his or her reach and social impact, whether through purchased followers or inauthentic engagement. According to CBS News, influencer fraud cost brands more than $1.3 billion in 2019. Companies spend an estimated $8.5 billion annually to persuade influencers to market their products. The problem? About 15% of the corporate dollars spent are lost to fraud, because influencers don't always have as many real followers as they claim. Brands typically pay influencers based on their reach, as measured by their number of followers. The sng, however, is that influencers sometimes buy fake followers, meaning brands pay for access to prospective customers who essentially don't exist. When an influencer profile is relatively new, but has a larger number of followers, this might be fraud. Influencers may also try to improve their engagement scores by using bots to engage with their posts. These forms of fraud are hard to spot because there's no automated method for identifying influencer fraud. It's a manual and time-consuming validation process.
* Brands aren't the only vitctims of influencer fraud. Regular people can be scammed too. That's because there's an increase in so-call virtual influencers, computer-generated images managed by bots. While some are cartoonish and easily identified, others are so life-like that they appear to be real. What's surprising is that virtual influencers are earning engagement rates that are three times the average for real influencers. So who are these virtual influencers? Lilmiquela is the most popular virtual influencer with nearly two million followers. Other popular virtual influencers include Noonoori and Imma.gram.
* In addition to preventing influencer fraud, social media marketers are also concerned with managing compliance and disclosure requirements by the Federal Trade Commission. To that end, the FTC wants to create more transparency in sponsored content by placing more onus on brands and influencers to openly divulge the relationship between companies and the influencers recommending their products or services. We'll talk more about the FTC and influencer compliance in Chapter 7.

## CASE STUDY
221BC'S SOCIAL INFLUENCE OPTIONS
* 221BC embraces the culture of social media as a way to spread its mission of kombucha as a gateway to a healthy lifestyle. As Aneta said, "When I started doing this, I knew I would be big business. I want to make the world a more beautiful, healthier place. The people I hire for our sales team have the same mission and the same principles. And we use a lot of social media to spread the message.
* When it comes to social communities and influencers. 221BC has a world of options. In terms of social objects, 221BC has focused on photos and videos on Instagram. But many other social objects may fit its mission and target market such as recipes, tips , motivational quotes, and coupons. Those objects and where its target audience is active on social media will determine the social network sites 221BC should leverage in its social media marketing campaign.
* In addition to social objects, 221BC may want to jump on the influencer marketing bandwagon. According to CreatorIQ, a data company that tracks campaigns of more than 5 million creator worldwide, influencer marketing campaigns have doubled in the past year. Instagram was the social network of choice of 93% of those campaigns.
* Of course, 221BC won't be the first kombucha brand to use influencers. Health-Ade Kombucha partnered with health and fitness duo Tone-It-Up for a popular co-branded flavor, Bubbly Rose. Health-Ade partners with an influencer platform called Trend to help identify influencers and manage its influencer campaigns. Health-Ade CEO, Daina Slekye Trout, said, "Trend allows us to always have a fresh stack of creative content to use across our website, social accounts, and ads. The Influencers are a pleasure to work with and always find ways to surprise us with what they can create". Another kombucha brand, Dr. Brew, took a slightly different approach to influencer marketing. It has a student ambassador program (for students with more than 500 Instagram followers) across many university campuses. In exchange for two social promotion posts per week, Dr. Brew student ambassadors get free kombucha and Dr. Brew swag. GT's Living Foods leveraged a meme and organic influencer support! Magician influencer Zach King published a video of himself creatively unscrewing a GT's Kombucha bottle as part of the bottle cap challenge meme. GT's quickly scooped it up and re-posted with hearty praise. This was not a paid influencer sponsorship, but GT's recognizerd the value of King's following and made the most of the organic endorsement.
* 221BC will need to identify influencers that may fit with its target market (identified in Chapter 2) and facilitate meeting its objectives. How do marketers go about selecting influencers? **While metrics like engagement rate certainly matter, the most important quality companies look for when evaluating influencers is the quality of their content. This suggests that strong creative content will be a key differentiator for effective influencer marketing. The second most important factor is influencer alignment with the company's target audience, which highlights the increasing importance of granular audience demographics data for influencer campaigns.** 221BC must keep in mind that the influencer charactertistics must align with its brand identity and its target audience. For instance, a female yoga influencer is a more natural partner for a kombucha drink than a male mindfulness expoert, even if their audiences are very similar.

1. What social objects should 221BC share to engage its target market?
2. How can 221BC leverage word-of-mouth communication?
3. What memes could 221BC use to help the virality of its message?

## STRATEGIC PLANNING AND SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
GT's Living Foods is buying into social media, big time. the company has strategically utilized several different social media zones, channels, and vehicles in recent years. The comapny has an active presence in social communities, including Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and Linkedin. It's committed to social media, including social media strategies in-house to lead its campaigns and "always-on" strategy. Because of its relevance to 221BC, we'll hear more about GT's approach to social media marketing in this chapter.
* For marketers like those at GT's Living Foods, **strategic planning** is the process of identifying objectives to accomplish, deciding how to accomplish those objectives with specific strategies and tactics, implementing the actions that make the plan come to life, and measuring how well the plan met the objectives. The process of strategic planning is three-tiered, beginning at the corporate level, then moving the the business level, and lastly moving to the functional areas of the organization, including marketing. Planners first identify their overall objectives (e.g., "raise consumer awareness of our brand by 10% in the next year") and then develop the specific tactics they will use to reach those goals (e.g., "increase our spending on print advertising in targeted publications by 15% this year"). A **marketing plan** is a written, formalized plan that details the product, pricing, distribution, and promotional strategies that will enable the brand in question to accomplish specific marketing objectives. Table 4.1 provides a sample of an overall marketing plan structure.

                        * How do we integrate supply chain elements to maximize the value we offer to our customers and other stakeholders?

                D: IMPLEMENT AND CONTROL MARKETING PLAN

                1. Action Plans (for all marketing mix elements)
                        * How do we make our marketing plan happen?
                
                2. Responsibility: 
                        * Who is responsible for accomplishing each aspect of implementing the marketing plan?

                3. Timeline:    
                        * What is the timing for the elements of our marketing plan
                
                4. Budget:
                        * What budget do we need in order to accomplish our marketing objectives?
                
                5. Measurement and Control:
                        * How do we measure the actual performance of our marketing plan and compare it to our planned performance and progress toward reaching our marketing objectives?

* On second thought, what's wrong with jumping right into the game? Why should we take the time to plan? Although it's tempting to just follow our instincts, it turns out there is tremendous value in planning. Dumb luck and sweat take you only so far. Planning ensures that an organization understands its markets and its competitors. It helps to ensure that organizations are aware of the chaning marketplace environment. When organizational partners partipate in the planning process, they are better able to communicate and coordinate activities. Planning requires that objectives are set and agreed upon, which improves the likelihood of those objectives being met. It enhances the ability of managers to allocate limited resources using established priorities. Perhaps most of all, planning enables success to be defined. Success or the lack thereof becomes a measurable outcome that can guide future planning efforts.
* it's increasingly common for organizations to include a heavy dose of social media in their marketing plans. The annual **Social Media Marketing Industry Report** provides data on the use of social media marekting by B2B and B2C marketers around the world. The more recent report revealed that 93% of all marketers indicated that their social media efforts have generated more exposure for their businesses, among other benefits. Whether large or small, B2B or B2C, most businesses recognize that social media should be integrated into their marketing plans. most are doing so for branding and demand generation purposes, but social media marketing is also valuable for managing customer service interactions and conducting market research. This upward trend will continue in the coming years.
* It makes sense to include social media marketing in a brand marketing plan. Social media marketing has many applications for marketers. Social media can be a delivery tool to build buzz and word-of-mouth communication. It can efficiently deliver coupons and other special promotional offers. Social platforms can be the primary venue for the execution of contests media can also serve as efficient channels to manage customer service relationships and to conduct research for new product development. Not to mention, social media are relatively inexpensive ways to increase the reach and frequency of messages that are otherwise delivered via more traditional, big media methods.
* Because the creative applications related to social media are somewhat unique, we will suggest an approach for developing an in-depth social media marketing strategy similar to an advertising plan (also known as an integrated marekting communications (IMC) plan or marcom plan) that provides in-depth detail on the execution of the (traditional) promotional portion of a brand's marketing plan. In the early days of social media marketing, many plans were developed for stand-alone campaigns that were not fully integrated into the brand's promotional mix. Today, social media marketing campaigns may serve as stand-alones and/or be a fully integrated media choice in the brand's marcom plan. Many marketers today strive for "always-on" social media to ensure consistent communicaitons and engagement with brand fans. Table 4.2 provides the structure of a social media marketing plan. We'll begin this process as we explore the strategic development of social media marketing plans. Then we'll cover the steps in strategic planning for social media marketing. Finally, we'll discuss structural approaches organizations can take to be prepared to execute their plans.

## THE PHASES OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING MATURITY
* If you keep up with industry news, you might be tempted to think that every brand has a social media strategy. Each day seems to bring new stories about a marketing campaign with social media elements. On ads, storefronts, and business cards, we see "Follow me" calls to action as organizations large and small flock to Twitter and Facebook.
* Although it seems everyone is talking about social media, it's one thing to claim you use social media and quite another to say you have a strategy that incorporates social media. In the former case, a group can turn to social media activities to stage **stunts** (one-off ploys designed to get attention and press coverage) or as **activation tools** to support other marketing efforts. For example, when Skittles let its social media presence take over its website, that was a stunt. But when Starbucks runs social media promotions, it integrates these promotions with the overall campaign in place. The most engaging brands using social media for marketing will ensure that all communications are consistent with the brand's image, while using social media as an element for experimentation and engagement with short-term campaigns as well as use in omni-channel marcom campaigns.
* As organizations develop in their social media marketing maturity, they plan systematically to ensure social media marketing activities are consistent with their marketing and marketing communications plans and are capable of meeting specific marketing objectives. By this we mean that, as a result of time and experience, we tend to see that applications that start as one-time "experiements" often morph into more long-term and carefully thought-out elements that the organization integrates with all the other communication pieces it uses to reach customers.
* Nevertheless, many marketers currently use social media marketing tactics without that level of maturity. A major study of marketers in both Europe and North America found huge differences in the level at which respondents use social media and integrate them with their other initiatives. Many still just experiement with baby steps (like managing a Facebook page) rather than include social media as a fundamental components of their marketing strategy. Companies can be thought of in terms of their level of maturity in social media marketing, of which there are three phases: trial, transition, and strategic. Let's take a closer look at each phase.

### TRIAL PHASE
* The trial phase is the first phase of the adoption cycle. Organizations in the trial phase test out social media platforms, but they don't really consider how social media can play a role in the overall marketing plan. In these early days, most groups focus on learning to use a new form of communication and exploring the potential for social media as a venue.
* It isn't necessarily a bad thing to test the waters of social media. Companies need, especially early on, to experiment--to play in the sandbox, so to speak. Doing so helps them to brainstorm ideas to use social media and understand what it takes to succeed in this brave new world. However, the problem with the trial phase is that many companies do not treat it as an exploratory stage of what is really a multi-stage process. Instead they just jump right in and focus only on cool new ways to communicate. Think this couldn't happen? According to the 2019 Social Media Marketing Industry Report, 35% of marketers have been using social media for less than two years.

### EXHIBIT 4.1:
THE TRANSITION STAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* GT's Living Foods appears to be in the strategic phase of social media marketing now, but that wasn't always the case. In 2010, the brand was in the transition stage of social media marketing. How do we know? In 2010, GT's Kombucha mysteriously went missing from supermarket shelves. Customers learned through word-of-mouth communication that the product's alcohol content was mislabeled. During shipment, the product was unrefrigerated, causing the alcohol content to rise above regulated levels and beyond the indicated on its labels. This was a clear concern for people who drank it for the health benefits, and especially pregnant women. The tainted kombucha was removed from shelves, but GT's failed to handle the social media response. Hundreds of fans posted to GT's Facebook page asking when the product would be available and what had happened. There was no response from GT's! The brand simply didn't respond! What would you think? You got it. Social media is 24/7. Brands don't have the option of being on only eight hours per day. issues like this can be amplified by influencers. We tend to think of brands partnering with influencers to increase the reach and spread of positive content. But if influencers have a negative experience, their complaint spread as well. GT's Living Foods learned this the hard way. Fortunately, the brand has improved its social media responsiveness over time.

### TRANSITION PHASE
* An organizations mature in their use of social media marketing, they enter a **transition phase**. During this phase, social media activities still occur somewhat randomly or haphazardly but a more systematic way of thinking starts to develop within the organization. In the transition stage, brands are on the right track but may not have fully formed a strategic approach. For instance, the brand may have established social media profiles and be using them regularly but still make mistakes. A common one is the use of automation to schedule social media posts and replies. This means that some of the responses to tweets or Facebook posts (or other social media comments) are programmed. In the industry, these automated responses are useful for workflow management but users view automation as fake, referring to the practice as **social media zombies**. In and of itself, that's not bad. Automation can help brands be responsive. But if overused or use ineffectively, people will know. And they will resent it.

### STRATEGIC PHASE
* When an organization enters the final strategic phase, it utilizes a formal process to plan social media marketing activities with clear objectives and metrics. Social media are now integrated as a key component of the organization's overall marketing plan. While making a strategic commitment to social media marketing takes time, it also comes with benefits. Marketers report increased brand exposure, brand attitudes, and even sales driven from social media marketing. Of course, this isn't necessarily easy, even for marketers with substantial experience using social media. A need to show the ROI for marketing activities coupled with a fluid social media environment creates challenges.

### CRITICAL REFLECTION
SOCIAL MEDIA AREN'T EASY
* marketers are smitten with social media. Social media investment remains high. For example, in the US, spending on social network is expected to exceed $43 billion. According to the CMO Survey, social media spending makes up more than 11% of marketing budgets. Clearly, commitment to social media is strong. That said, social media marketing is not without disadvantages. Let's take a look at some of the concerns marketers face when marketing with social media.

1. Socia media are time consuming.
* This is one of the biggest cons of social media marketing. For an effective marketing effort, you need to invest time engaging and publishing social content suitable enough to keep your audience interested and engaged. This requires time to develop high-quality content as well as time posting to SNS and replying to posts from fans and critics. Social media may cost less in hard currency than some other media forms, but they require more human touch. What's more, time must be a continuous investment. Social media marketing is not a quick marketing solution. It can take a long time to achieve your objectives. As much as we hear about the successes of memes and viral videos, it is important you know social media are not a genie that will instantly start granting wishes; it takes time.

2. ROI is difficult to measure.
* To date, Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) acknowledge that social media's contribution to organizational performance has been relatively modest. On a scale of 1 = not at all contributing to 7 = very highly contributing, respondents to the CMO Survey rated social media's contribution between 3.1 and 3.3 over the last five years. In part, the ratings may be due to the difficulty in measuring social media return on investment. As we'll discuss in Chapter 11, "likes" and impressions provide initial metrics on the success of social media efforts, but it can be difficult to deduce how social media contribute to acquiring new customers and driving sales. CMOs say they struggle with this issue. The CMO Survey found that 39.3% of companies report they are unable to show the impact of social media on performance, and another 36% have a good qualitative sense of the impact, but not a quantitative measure of the impactt. Every social media marketing effort has an objective whether that is to increase website traffic, drive sales, or build brand awareness. It can be difficult to attribute outcomes to social media marekting efforts.

3. There is a risk of negative publicity
* Social media marketing is a very powerful tool for the promotion of a company, but it can also use that the same force to pull down or negatively impact a business. When organization adopt social media marketing, they are also exposing the brand to external threats. Just as people face social media trolls, so do brands. Trolls may slander a brand and post negative comments even when they have no idea what the company does. Without proper management, such negative publicity can go viral and irreparably damage the reputation of your business.

* Legitimate negative publicity can also gain traction via social media channels. For example, Johnson & Johnson faced a major public relations challenge related to its perceived role in the opiod epidemic and amid concerns about the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder, which was the target of a major product recall. Vocal consumers took to Twitter to express outrage at the possibility of asbestos in Johnson's baby Powder, and the firestorm spread to other J&J brands including Aveeno. Aveeno's online net sentiment plummeted! The situation was worsened when Aveeno's spokesperson, Jennifer Aniston, was accused of posting a photo of herself revealing possible illicit drug use. Aveeno's brand equity was surely damaged by these Twitter posts and conversations.

## SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS: THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS
* Those organizations that have moved beyond the trial and transition phases of social media marketing maturity develop strategic plans for social media that incorporate components of the social media mix as channels to accomplish marketing objectives. As we saw in Table 4.2, the process consists of the following steps:

                * Conduct a situation analysis and identify key opportunities
                * State objectives and allocate resources
                * Gather insight into and target one or more segments of social consumers.
                * Select the social media mix (zones, channels, and vehicles)
                * Create an experience strategy.
                * Establish an activation plan using other promotional tools (if needed)
                * Execute and measure the campaign.
        
## SITUATION ANALYSIS
* The first step in developing the plan is much the same as it is in the creation of traditional strategic plans--**research and assess the environment. Good social media planning starts with research on the industry and competitors, the product category, and the consumer market. Once this research is compiled, stratgists try to make sense of the findings as they analyze the data in a situation analysis.**
* The situation analysis details the current problem or opportunity the organization faces. It will typically include a social media audit. In addition to the standard things marketers need to know, the social media audit ensures the team understands the brand's experience in social media. The audit will assess the brand's past social media activity, including whether profiles and consistent with the brand image, frequency of activity, types of activity, responsiveness, engagement, and other measures of effectiveness. Free tools that are useful for auditing social media activities are LikeAlyzer, Fan Page Karma, and AgoraPulse. Audit report can also be created using paid vendor services like those from Sprout Social, Sysomos, and others. Figure 4.1 provides a template for beginning a social media audit.
* In addition, a review of the brand's SWOT analysis will highlight relevant aspects of the firm's internal and external environment that could affect the organization's choices, capabilities, and resources. This acronym refers to strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that the firm should consider as it crafts a strategy. The internal environment refers to the strengths and weaknesses of the organization--the controllable elements inside a firm that influence how well the firm operates. The external environment consists of those elements outside the organization--the organization's opportunities and threats--that may affect its choices and capabilities. Unlike elements of the internal environment that management can control to a large degree, the firm can't directly control these external factors, so management must respond to them through its planning process.
* A key aspect of the external environment is the brand's competition. Analyzing competitive social media efforts and how the target market perceives those efforts is a must-do in social media marketing planning. It can be done in much the same way as the social media audit--except the focus in on the competing firms. You can use an internal system or a **cloud service** such as Klue (klue.com) to organize competitive information and to monitor news and social activity. When you use Klue, you can maintain a search of competitive activity and news mentions online for a small fee. Figure 4.2 illustrates a template for tracking a social media competitive analysis. Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi Brand Analysis, which assesses effectiveness as well as brand activity in social media. A competitive social media analysis should answer the following questions:

* In which social media channels and specific vehicles are competitors active?
* How do they present themselves in those channels and vehicles? Include an analysis of profiles, company information provided, tone, and activity
* Who are their fans and followers? How do fans and followers respond to the brand's social activity?

* Importantly, marketers have many approaches to solve problems and taking advantage of opportunities. Here we are concerned with the organization's use of social media, but still, the planner should ask the question, "Given the situation and the problem identified, is social media marketing the appropriate approach?" Especially for organizations that are still in the trial phase, it's tempting to focus on social media "gimmicks", even if other less trendy tactics might in fact be more effective. So, a word of caution: social media often provide effective solutions to marketing problems, but beware of blindly using these tools.
* To see how the early stages of the strategic planning process work in the real world, let's return to our example, GT's Living Food. GT's uses social media as part of its integrated social media initiatives, particularly related to community altruism. It does so in a way that resonates with specific social media vehicles like Facebook, Twitter, instagram, Youtube, and Pinterest. GT's Living Foods is the market leader in kombucha and has more shelf space and brand awareness than any other kombucha brand. That's why GT's founder is called the King of Kombucha. But GT's faces stiff competition from other major brands, regional brands, and even do-it-yourselfers who brew their own kombucha at home. Table 4.3 provides a SWOT analysis for GT's Living Foods.

## IDENTIFY SOCIAL MEIDA MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES
* In this stage of the process, the planner elaborates on what is expected of the social media campaign and what financial and human resources are available to meet those objectives. An **objective** is a specific statement about a planned social media activity in terms of what that activity intends to accomplish. The content of the objective will vary based on the situation and the problem at hand. For instance, the campaign may be designed to amplify other marketing communication efforts the organization uses. Let's say, for example, the brand co-sponsors a concert series. This series is an event marketing strategy built into the overall marketing commmunication plan. But the organization realizes that promoting the event using social media can build pre- and post-event buzz. In this case, the objective (to create heightened awareness of the event among target customers) relates to other activities in the organization.
* The basic assumption is that the campagin can accomplish the desired marketing objectives. What are some examples of the basic marekting objectives social media marketers pursue? Figure 4.3 illustrates several social media objecitves. here are some important ones: 

                * Increase brand awareness
                * Improve brand or product reputation
                * Increase website traffic
                * Amplify or augment public relations work
                * Improve search engine rankings
                * Improve perceived customer service quality
                * Generate sales leads
                * Reduce customer acquisition and support costs
                * INcrease sales/sales revenue.

* In this tage of planning, it's important to state the objectives in a way that will help the planner to make other decisions in the planning process and eventually to measure the extent to which the objective was accomplished at specific points into the campaign. A well-stated, actionable objective should include the following characteristics:

* be specific (what, who, when, where)
* be measurable
* specify the desired change (from a baseline)
* include a timeline
* be consistent and realistic (given other corporate activities and resources)

* Here's an example of an actionable objective: To increase site stickiness in the retail areas of our site by 100% (from five minutes browsing to ten minutes per site visit) with the addition of social commerce sharing applications by the end of the third quarter. The statement of the objective should include specific elaboration on the individual goals  the brand wishes to achieve over the course of the campaign, taking care to state these goals such that they are specific, measurable, realistic, adn time-lined. We don't know GT's precise objectives but we can gauge that GT's seeks to generate engaging content for popular social networks, build its gan base in social communities, build brand equity, and increase top-of-mind awareness.

                FIGURE 4.3: Top Objectves Marketers Pursue Using Social Media
                * increase Exposure
                * Increase traffic
                * Generated leads
                * Improve sales
                * Developed loyal fans
                * Provided marketplace insight
                * Increase thought leadership
                * Grew business partnership

* There should be a focus on resources. You've probably heard people say that the main benefit of social media marketing is that it's free. When brand managers work with agencies to plan traditional advertising campaigns, the cost of media placement can seem overwhelming. With that as a point of comparison, one can see why many might think of social media marketing as the free alternative to advertising. Even for brand participation in social network sites, social media are not free. In planning a social media campaign, a budget must be allocated that ensures sufficient resources to accomplish the goals--just like in a traditional ad program. Granted, the media costs are often must lower compared to, say, a national television campaign. But there are other costs associated with social media. Charlene Li, a leading social media strategist, once said, "Social media trades media costs for labor costs"
* What does Li's comment mean? To a large extent, the social communities in which brands engage consumers are indeed free to play spaces in term of media costs. But there are other costs we must take into account. Content must be generated, shared, and managed, and the time that that takes requires funding. Strategies in some social media channels of our social media framework require development costs (in-house or with a vendor or agency) such as customizing profiles and developing social games, branded applications and widgets, and microsites. Organic reach is increasingly difficult for brands to achieve as well. The result in an increase in  the use of advertising (paid media) on SNS. At the end of the day, there's no such thing as free lunch!
* Most organizations to date allocate only a small portion of their marketing budgets to social media. Current estimates are under 10%! Though that budget is expected to nearly double in the next five years! Where will this money be spent? Primarily organizations are staffing for content management, ensuring that time is available for content development, blogging, and monitoring of social channels and paying for social advertising. As we described in Chapter 1, the job of social media manager, akin to that of a brand manager, is becoming more commonplace. This person has the role of overseeing, managing, and championing the social media strategy internally. Most organizations now have a dedicated team for social media marketing, but 80% of teams have fewer than four people. Typical roles include that of social media strategist, community manager, social media analyst, and social media assoicate. In addition, organizations may budget for software and services to manage social media acocunts, manage projects, analyze effectiveness, automate tasks for efficiency, host content, monitor social conversations and collect data, and facilitate content creation. Agencies and other providers can supplement the work of the social media manager (or team) with ideas, ways to integrate social media marketing with the rest of the brand's marcom plan, technical expertise, and measurement.
* As with everything else in business, the budget is critical--without funding, the organization can't initiate or maintain the campaign. How much should it allocate? When it comes to social media campaigns, budgets run the gamut from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
* Many companies approach social media marketing budgets as a percentage of their ad spends, which in turn are assigned by planners within the organization according to one of several formulae. The percentage of ad spend method assigns a set portion of the overall advertising budget for the organization to social media activities. Some use a variation, where they allocate a percentage of online marketing funding to social media.
* Two other methods are used by companies. the competitive parity method uses competitors' spending as a benchmark. Like advertiser share of voice, competitive parity is based on the belief that spending the same or more on social media marketing will result in a comparable change in share of attention for the brand. When it comes to social media, though, share of voice takes on a new dimension; social media include conversation about the brand from other sources. In contrast, with advertising, increasing share of voice is accomplished by simply purchasing more media time for advertisements.
* With soial media marketing, the costs of different approaches and platforms vary widely, and even a large spend may not result in widespread buzz or content sharing and viral spread. The resulting share of voice depends in part of the extent to which fans and friends share the message with their own networks. Lastly, the objective-and-task method considers the objectives set out for the campaign and determines the cost estimates for accomplishing each objective. This method builds the budget from a logical base with what is to be accomplished as the starting point.

## PROFILE THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF SOCIAL CONSUMERS
* Social media marketing plans, like any marketing plan, must target the desired audience in a meaningful and relevant manner. To do this the development of a social media profile of the target audience is required. The target market for the brand will have been defined in the brand's marketing plan in terms of demographic, geographic, psychographic, and product-usage characteristics. The target audience's social profile will take this understanding of teh market one step farther. It will include the market's social activities and styles, such as their level of social media participation, the channel they utilize and the communities in which they are active, and their behaviour in social communities. You learned about the elements of segmentation and targeting and the use of personnas in Chapter 2.
* The strategic planner must assess what it means to speak to the audience in the social media space. Who is the core target? How can we describe the key segments of that core target? To whom will the conversations in social media be directed? Of which social communities are the consumers a member? How do they use social media? How do they interact with other brands? The insights from the consumer profile that was done for a brand's overall marketing and marcom plans will be useful to understand the overall profile of the target market.
* However, the planner also must understand how and when his or her customers interact in online social communities, as weell as which devices they use to do so. In developing a consumer profile, the planner may plot out a typical day for the social media user as well as gather information on the Internet activites of the audience.
* However, the planner also must understand how and when his or her customers interact in online social communities, as well as which devices they use to do so. In developing a consumer profile, the planner may plot out a typical day for the social media user as well as gathering information on the Internet actvities of the audience.
* GT's profiles will align its sub-brands. The target audience for its Aqua kefir is different than that for its Synergy product line, and so on. For example, Aqua Kefir was designed for non-kombucha drinkers. GT's Living Foods uses the insights about each persona to guide specific campaigns and interactions across its social media activities

## SELECT SOCIAL MEDIA MIX: ZONES, CHANNELS, AND VEHICLES
* Once the organization understands who it wants to reach, it's time to select the best **social media mix** to accomplish this. The zones of social media make up the channel and vehicle choices available for a social media mix. Similar to a more traditional marketing mix, the social media mix describes the combination of vehicles the strategy will include to attain the organization's objectives.
* The social media mix options lie among the four zones we've already discussed: relationship development in social communities, social publishing, social entertainment, and social commerce. We cover these zones in depth in the next section of the book. Within each zone are many specific vehciels that may be best suited to reach a certain audience. For instance, to meet the desired objectives and the social media patterns of a target audience that includes college students, the planner may determine that the campaign should include social networking, social publishing, and social games. The media vehecles might include Facebook, Youtube, and Flickr. Social publishing may utilize a corporate blog and document sharing sites such as Scribd. Brands can leverage the popularity of games, music, and video using the zone of social entertainment. It's also a good idea at this stage of planning to map out how the campaign will build earned media and utilize paid and owned media synergistically.

### EXHIBIT 4.2
GT'S EXPERIENCE STRATEGY INVITES FANS TO PARTICIPATE
* To promote its latest special edition kombucha, Pure Love, GT's Living Foods created a UGC campaign for Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. According to GT's Living Foods, this exclusive winter flavor enhances its kombucha with fresh pressed blood orange, rose, hibiscus, and 100% pure love. The Pure Love social media campaign seeks to promote universal love by inspiring acts of love for one's self and others. Even the bottle design was artistically render to capture the pure love sentiment. The founder and CEo of GT's Living Foods, known as GT Dave, said: "We believe now, more than ever, the world needs more love. Sometimes the world feels like a dark place--we can be slow  to love, but so quick to hate. Our flavor, Pure Love, is intended t oshine a bright light on what love is supposed to be--without limits, without race, without gender, without religion. Love is supposed to be pure"
* Instagram's user profile matches the persona for GT's target audience and UGC campaigns inspire engagement. The experience? Fans post a selfie with someone they love and a bottle of GT's Kombucha and tag the photo with #GTsPureLove. Each month, GT's will gift one winner with a special weekend gateway to experience with someone they love. The concept aligned with GT's overall marcom campaign, while effectively engaging the target audience. not only was the choice of experience and social vehicles appropriate given the target persona, the campaign was designed for propagation. Fans who contributed ideas were invested in the campaign and likely to share the campaign content with their friends. Importantly, all of GT's social media campaigns are built on UGC experiences, which help to ensure a stream of fresh content alongside fan engagement.

===

* GT's utilizes many of the zones of social media and multiple vehicles within each zone. The choice of zone and vehicle is based on the nature of the marketing objective and the persona characteristics, as well as how best to bring the experience strategy to life. See Figure 4.4 for a summary of GT's zone activity.

                Figure 4.4: GT's Zones of Social media Marketing

                Community: 
                        * Active participation in SNS, sharing content with hashtags, replying to fans, and interacting with influencer profiles
                        * In addition to GT's Living Foods, the CEO, GT Dave, is also active 
                        * Incentivized UGC contests
                        * Profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Pinterest
                Publishing: 
                        * Entertainment video content to Youtube
                        * Video and photo content to Instagram including words of enlightment
                        * Image content published to Pinterest
                        * History and benefit of kombucha content published on website and youtube
                Entertainment:
                        * Social music (e.g., interaction with Spotify including branded playlist)
                        * Donations to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation for UGC participation
                        * Participation in "bottle cap challenge" meme
                Commerce:
                        * Reviews and ratings

## DESIGN AN EXPERIENCE STRATEGY
* If we were planning advertising campaign, the next step would be to identify a creative message strategy. Message strategy refers to the creative approach we will use throughout the campaign. This should flow from the brand's **position statement**--a single written statement that encapsulates the position the brand wishes to hold in the minds of its target audience. Positioning statement succinctly capture the heart of what the brand is and what the sponsor wants it to become. Reviewing the position is a necessary step in preparing a social media marketing strategy, because the social media activities campagin plans and executes need to consistently suppport the desired message.
* Can you identify the brands that go with these positioning statement?

1. The computer for the rest of us
2. Networking networks
3. The world's information in one click
4. personal video broadcasting network

* The message strategy should also be appropriate to meet the campaign's objectives. it is developed from a creative brief--a document that helps creatives channel their energy toward a sound solution for the brand in question. In planning for social media marketing campaigns the design process works similarly; the planners create a brief to guide the development of the campaign. But--because unlike traditional media, social media focus on interactive experiences, social sharing, and engagement--the brief has a somewhat different structure and goes by a different name. Some planners call this document an experience brief.
* The concept of an experience brief evolved from the work of website developers who consider the direct impact on users when they design site architecture, imagery, copy and other site features. Griffin Farley, a strategy planner, uses a different term. He describes the planning document for social media as a propagation brief. He explains that propagation planning means to plan not for the people you reach, but for the people who they will reach. In other words, the audience produces more audience. Traditional advertising promotes a message to a passive audience, and that audience is the target. **Social media invite an interactive experience with an audience of influencers who will then share the brand's message and invite others to the experience.**
* Researchers conceptualize **brand experience** as the sensations, feelings, thoughts, and behaviours evoked by brand-related stimuli when consumers interact with brands, whether during exposure to brand messaging, shopping and service interactions, or product consumption. The four dimensions of brand experience point to important element in experience design: 

* To trigger the sensory dimension, the experience should engage the senses, especially visual.
* To evoke the affective dimension, the experience should be emotional
* To activate the behavioural dimension, the experience should enable phyiscal action.
* To stimulate the cognitive dimensions, the experience should stimulate curiosity, problem-solving, or other intellectual motive.

* Based on the brand experience dimensions, social media marketing strategies should use visual elements like video, emotional creative appeals (like humor, love, guilt, nostalgia, and fear), and interactive features. Surprisingly, research suggests that brands have focused on functional messages in social media marketing, far more than emotional messages. In one study of top brands using social media, nearly 90% of the brands studied used functional messages but only 57% used interactivity and 43% used emotional appeals. The study found that engagement and influence were both positively influenced by emotional appeals and interactivity, while functional appeals had no effect at all.
* To develop a social experience worthy of participation and worthy of sharing, social media planners ask and answer several questions. The answers become the basis for the brief:

* **What are the campaign goals and/or communication tasks? Objectives have been set for the campaign and the use of social media identified as a possibility. Here the planner reviews these decisions and provides a succinct overview of the goals.**
* how is the brand positioned? What is unique and special about its position in the marketplace? As in a traditional creative brief, any campaign work should leverage the brand's positioning strategy and build on the brand's strengths.
* Who is the target audience? You've profiled the target already. Now consider what you want the audience to do. Do you want them to talk to the brand? Create and share content? Spread the message to their network? On what devices (e.g., iPad, smartphone, desktop) will they interact with your brand? What could you offer of value in exchange for their cooperation?
* Is there another group of people who can persuade the target audience to follow them? This group comprises your influencers--the people who will propagate your message. Why would these people want to share your message with others? What's in it for them?
* What are the existing creative assets? How can the brand's creative assets foster a social experience? Most brands already have some **creative assets** that drive their paid and owned media. For example, a well-known and popular brand spokescharacter such as the GEICO gecko is a creative asset that the insurance company has developed in its traditional advertising, so he might be employed in a social media campaign to give the company a head start in terms of consumer recognition as it tries to break through the clutter of competing messages. The planner should list the creative assets that already exist and identify the assets he or she still needs in order to extend the brand's story. how can the creative assets already available be used and/or leveraged in a social media context?
* How can we integrate with other branded media being used by the organization, and how long do we have to execute? This is a question that references how the campaign can integrate best with the brand's paid and owned media.
* What experience are possible given target market needs and motives, the available channels, and the creative assets? How can we design these experiences to maximize device portability and access? Creative assets used in social media campaigns should inspire activity and interactivity. These questions ask what types of activities could be engaging for the target audience using multiple devices and worth sharing with their network.
* What content will be needed? Social media are content-driven. What content will be relevant to the campaign and what will be the source? Comments? Questions and polls? Videos? Images? Stories? Apps?
* How will experience engagement be extended and shared throughout the social channels? For instance, will engagement activity auto-post to status updates (e.g., "Tracy created a GT's playlist on Songpop")?

* After the planner goes through the process of discovery and briefing to provide these "must-knowns" to the creative team, the creative team will then enter the stage of ideation or concepting. **Discovery** is the term used to describe the research stage of the plan. Planners may rely on secondary and primary research as they seek to discover insights that will be useful to the creative team. These insights will be presented to the team during the briefing. The creative team will spend time brainstorming ideas and developing possible concepts for the campaign. Eventually the chosen ideas will be further refined and designed, and prototypes or mock-ups will be developed. These preliminary executions can then be used for internal review, usability testing, and other pre-testing.
* When a brand begins to interact in social spaces, **a key decision is how to represent the brand's social persona**. This means planners need to define how the brand will behave in the social web, what voice will be used, and even how deeply the brand will interact in the social space with customers. The decisions made should support the brand's position in the market. To introduce that persona, brands have several creative options. They may involve humanizing the brand (again, think of the GEICO gecko); showing a vulnerability to the customer and working as a steward to customer service (think Dell); or providing a value to the customer whether that value be function, information, or entertainment (think Nike). In GT's case, the brand's position is brand as corporate entity; though the founder, GT Dave, also has an active social media presence as a brand spokesperson.
* Additionally, the makeup of the brand's social persona may vary. Other brands, such as Zappos, utilize different employee voices in social communities so the online retailer's persona is the sum of its employees. Still others have represented the brand with a person, but with a single individual charged with the brand's social reputation. The brand's mascot may take the social stage as Travelocity has done with its Roaming Gnome. **Some brands present themselves as funny, comedic, thought leaders, and friends.** There is no right or wrong social persona--it should ulitmately be a social representation of the brand's position and of course be consistent with how the brand presents itself in other contexts.

### EXHIBIT 4.3
GT'S BRAND PERSONALITY SHINES IN SOCIAL MEDIA
* GT Dave and GT's brand personalities are reflected in their social media banter. In addition to brand fans, GT's Living Food's presence in zone 1--social community--also includes engaging with critics! It's any social media marketing pro's nightmare. GT Dave was singled out in a mocking Youtube video in which he was called The Kombucha King. Youtube creator Cody Ko published the video in which he and a colleague mocked Dave. The Kombucha King video garnered nearly 8 million views and 18,000 comments-- many of which were as unflattering. Most would be tempted to ignore such a crisis and hope it would simply blow over. Not GT Dave! instead, Dave shared the video on his personal Instagram profile with the message: "I love a good roaast and I think this video is funny as hell. Check it out if you want a good laugh--at my expense" Dave's post earned thousands of "likes"--more than seven times the average engagement on Dave's other Instagram content. Dave didn't stop there. He invited Ko and Miller to meet with him. As told in Winchel (2019), Dave said: "I was pleased to see that it was more of a "roast" and that you could tell that Cody is a legit fan of the product so he was cognizant of what lines he shouldn't cross. That was the impetus for me to reach out to them as I was convinced they were good guys and we could do something funny together." Ko and Miller documented their experience with GT Dave in another video called "Visiting the Kombucha Lair" which has more  than 6 million views. Dave shared the follow-up video on his Instagram with the tongue-in-check caption: "Who knew being cyber-bullied could be so much fun!" Dave's response made the most of the social media exposure and netted him new fans. Engagement across all of GT's Living Food's social media profiles increased and fans applauded GT Dave for his sense of humor. This was smart engagement! The response was clever, funny, and relevant! Plus, because the banter was picked up by news outlets as a story, GT's was able to reach an even larger audience--but without the cost of paying influencers. Dave said, "You also need to be aware of your tone, words, and of course any imagery as you're in somewhat of a hybrid role of still being a brand representative but also being perceived a peer. You have to maintain a balance of a professional position while still having a casual and relaxed quality about you". The story serves as a reminder to marketing pros that not all social media trolling has a bad ending.

## INTEGRATING WITH OTHER PROMOTIONAL COMPONENTS AND ESTABLISH ACTIVATION PLAN
* Traditional media campaigns typically live a desinated lifespan with timing tied to the accomplishment of specific objectives. For social media, though, campaigns are not necessarily events with fixed start and stop dates. Conversations in communities continue over time, and a brand's social media marketing presence should do this as well. This is particularly true for brands that rely on social media for customer service and custoemr relationship management. Some of the most famous social brands, like Dell and Zappos, are "always on" with their social media campaigns. They aim to project a constant presence in the communities in which they participate. GT's Living Foods uses a mix of short-term campaigns and ongoing presence. Other organizations have also done this.

### EXHIBIT 4.4
GT'S MAKES SOCIAL COMMUNITY MEANINGFUL
* Brand-created experiences are among the most effective tactics for building consumer engagement. GT's connects with its loyal customers thorugh its "Living in Gratitude" social media strategy--by tying philanthropic donations to UGC on social media channels. For example, to promote its Living in Gratitude kombucha flavor, GT's asks fans to post a photo with a GT's donates ten meals to people in need via Feeding America, the nation's largest organization dedicated to fighting domestic hunder through a network of food banks. The approach leverages the altruistic motive (discussed in Chapter 2), rewards fans for their UGC engagement, and ensures plenty of social media content to keep GT's social media feeds fresh and interesting. The campaign also educates fans with a video about hunder on GT's Youtube Channel. That's not GT's Living Foods' only philanthropic campaign. Its employees are also actively volunteering throughout the community. For instance, the brand launched a program hashtag #GT4Good, where employees can volunteer to help local organizations. For example, the brand volunteered at Los Angeles-based Grow Good, a non-profit organization that works to turn communities into agricultural centers filled with all kinds of greenery. In another campaign, GT's asked fans to post a picture of themselves with their bottle of kombucha using the hashtag #InFullBloom. For every picture received, GT's donated $5 to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. Clearly, GT's is infusing philanthropy thorughout its social media marketing strategy.

## EXECUTE AND MEASURE OUTCOMES
* In the final stage of the strategic planning process, we implement the plan and measure the results. In Chapter 11, we'll go into detail about the metrics we can use to assess the effectiveness of social media campaigns. The data gathered on all aspects of the social media plan are used to provide insight for future campaigns.
* As we've seen, many organizations are still "social media wannabes". They 're at an early stage in the process and feeling their way in a new environment. So perhaps we can forgive them for the common mistakes they tend to make. Here are some of the biggest offenders:

* Staffing: the initial imperative when it comes to social media marketing is to simply get there--to have a presence in the community of interest. But focusing on presence can result in brand assets that are underutilized and underperforming in terms of the objectives set of the campaign. Organizations in the trial and transition phases tend to focus on establishing Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts, or perhaps on planning a UGC contest. These companies take an "if you build it, they will come" Field of Dreams approach, **without addressing ways to build and maintain traffic and interest. ultimately though, social media marketing is built on the community , content, and technology inherent to social media. To make it successful, the brand must be active in the space--and that means committing staff time to posting, responding, and developing content.**
* Content: a related issue is the failure to introduce new, fresh, and relevant content. Developing interactivity, emphasizing relevant, monitoring the asset for needed maintenance, responding to visitor feedback, and providing new content will keep the asset fresh and inspire a curiosity to return among the core audience. Importantly, these components of successful social media marketing require an ongoing commitment of human resources.
* **Time horizon: social media work differently tahn do traditional advertising, and may require patience before results are delivered.** Although television campaign can utilize a heavy buy early in its media plan to incite near immediate awareness and build momentum, social media are just the opposite. It can take months for a social media campaign to build awareness (and there are plenty of social media failures that never gained traction). Assuming the plan itself is sound, organizations must be patient while the community embraces the content and the relationship. Although the results may take longer to see, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the social media model can be well worth the patience and resources required.
* Focus of objectives: it's not uncommon for organizations to focus on action steps rather than desired outcomes from social media. In other words, they take a short-term tactical approach rather than a long-term strategic approach. **An inappropriate objective might read: "Increase engagement by responding to comments on Twitter and Facebook within 24 hours of posting, posting three status updates per business day, and adding links to social media accounts on the corporate blog". Do you see the error? The emphasis is on the action stpes the social media manager will complete (tactical) but there's no focus on what the social media activities should do for the brand. There is no value in doing social media marekting for the sake of social media--the value lies in accomplishing marketing objectives.** Social media are more than the "flavor of the month"--they have the potential to provide lasting and measurable benfits when campaigns are done right.
* Benefits to users: social media live or die on the quality of the content a platform offers to users. That content must add value to the social community. A social media marketing plan answers the question: How will we distribute our content using social media channels? But it also must answer other questions: How can we engage our target audiences in social media communities? What content is valued by our audiences? Do they want content that informs? Entertains? How can we develop an ongoing stream of relevant, fresh content? This should be connected to the experience strategy.
* Measurement: organizations fail to properly measure results. Marketing consultant Tom Peters famously observed, "What gets measured gets done". As social media marketing has developed, some evangelists have encouraged new disciples to keep the faith, emphasizing the growth and and popularity of the media as reason enough to develop a presence in the space. In the long term,  that's just not good enough. for organizations to succeed in social media marketing, measurement is critcal. Measuring outcomes ensures that the organization is learning fromm what worked and what didn't Importantly, as organizations begin to shift more marketing dollars from traditional advertising to social media marketing, managers will seek out comparisons on metrics such as ROI between social media and other media options.

## MANAGINE SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING IN THE ORGANIZATION
* So there we have it--a framework to plan a social media marketing campaign. In Chapter 5, we'll take a closer look at the tactics social media marketers use and how social media teams plan for the daily, weekly, monthly, and annual activities. But social media teams aren' the only employees who play a role in social media. **Other divisions may interact with the social media team to share brand assets, meet information technology needs, address customer concerns, design creative materials, evaluate risk and potential legal liabilities, identify prospects, coordinate sales and special offers.** In other words, social media teams will likely interact with marketing, sales, customer support, information systems, web design, legal, human resources, and finance. In addition, employees can be valuable brand advocates in social media channels. But they can also cause problems. Stories abound of employees who tweeted an insult on an impulse that reflected poorly on the employer brand and harmed customer relationships. To address the roles employees play across the organization, companies rely upon social media policies.

## THE SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY
* Companies need to develop, adopt, and publicize a social media policy among employees. A social media policy is an organizaitonal document that explains the rules and procedures for social media activity for the organizatio and its employees. Just like you, many employees are already engaged in social media. They may be active on social network sites and microsharing tools like Facebook and Twitter. While employees may use social media to communicate with friends and access entertainment opportunities (maybe even when they're supposed to be working!), there's a good chance they will mention their employers and maybe even vent about office politics or shoddy products. Managing that risk is a must for companies. And many companies will recognize that these employees can act as powerful brand ambassadors when they participate in social media. As we mentioned, Zappos takes advantage of teh fact that many of its employees participate in social media vehicles--and these enthusiastic team members promote the company in the process.
* Of course, there's no guarantee that an employee (at least on his or her own time) will necesarily say only glowing things about the company. Brands use formal documents to ensure that the company is protected in a legal sense and also to encourage employees to participate in ways that are consistent with the brand's overall strategy. Here are excerpts from three companies' policies.

* Microsoft: if you plan to tweet about any professional matters (such as about the business of Microsoft or other companies, products, or services, in the same business space as Microsoft), in addition to referencing your alias@microsoft.come email address, whenever possible use the service's profile or contact information to assert that you are a Microsoft employee and/or affiliated with a specific group/team at Microsoft.
* Sun Microsystems: whether in the actual or virtual world, your interactions and discourse should be respectful. For example, when you are in a virtual world as a Sun representative, your avatar should dress and speak professionally. We all appreciate actual respect.
* Intel: consider content that's open-ended and invites response. Encourage comments. You can broaden the conversation by citing others who are bloggin about the same topic and allowing your content to be shared or syndicated...If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront, and be quick with your correction. If you're posting a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post--just make it clear that you have done so.

* The Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA -- now part of the Association of National Advertisers) developed a quick guide to designing a digital social media policy, shown in Table 4.4. Its purpose is to guide how the organization, its employees, and its agents should share opinions, beliefs, and information with social communities. Not only is it good business, it can also help prevent legal problems. The guide encourages organizations to make several decisions and include those in an organization-wide social media policy. Organizations must decide upon:

* Standard of conduct: standards of conduct in a social media policy refer to the basic expectations for employee behaviour in social communities. At a minimum, standards should require that all online statements about the business be honest and trasparent. Deceptive, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims about the organization or its competitors must not be issued. Further, good manners must be used in social communities (no ethnic slurs, personal insults, rumors, lies, or other offensive statements)
* Disclosure requirements: transparency is key in online communities. Employees must disclose that they are affiliated with the organization. If they are receiving material compensation or gifts in exchange for posting, this must be disclosed. Disclosing affiliations ensures that readers can still find the posts credible and trustworthy. Bloggers should include a simple statement: "I received (inserted product name) from (insert company name) and here is my opinion..." In addition, when using posts on social networks, the poster should use hashtags to disclose the nature of relationships reflected in the posts: "#emp (employee/employer), #samp (free sample received), #paid (paid endorsement).
* Standards for posting intellectual property, financial information, and copyrighted information: many of the potential legal problems within social media relate to the inappropriate sharing of information. Organizations should keep all intellectual property and prviate financial information confidential. Prior to posting copyrighted information, appropriate permissions should be collected.

## AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SOCIAL MEDIA
* Who "owns" social media within an organization? Some brand assign the responsibility to a discipline "silo" such as the marketing department, whereas others rely upon a **center of excellence model** that pulls people with different kinds of expertise from across the organization to participate. This eliminates the internal political issues relating to who in the company has primary responsibility for social media so it's easier to integrate social media applications with other marketing initiatives.
* Aside from the organizational structure to support social media marketing efforts, busiensses must make decisions on the level of resources to dedicate. Social media are ongoing conversations across potentially several communication vehicles. Some businesses dedicate multiple employees to manage the conversation calendar, whereas others assign a single person. The organizational task is to assign the least number of resources needed internally and then supplement those resources with help from the organization's social media agency resources.
* There are five basic models for social media structure as shown in Figure 4.5:

* Organic MY: Random nodes connected with each oter
* Centralized: MY: a tree
* Hub and Spoke--Coordinated: MY: One node in the middel connected to many node
* Multiple Hub and Spoke--Dandelion
* Holistic Honeycomb

1. In the centralized structure the social media department functions at a senior level taht reports to the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) or CEO (Chief Executive officer) and is responsible for all the social media activations. The potential problem here is that all social media activity may not be adequately represented. Is customer care going to be good if social media marketing is housed under marketing rather than customer service?
2. In the organic structure no one person owns social media. Instead, all employees represent the brand and work social media into their roles. This is implemented through training and used across the organization. The danger here is that the content can end up off message. Any employee can sign up to respond to customer queries on Twitter. That means the company can not control what employees say. Therefore, the company must have well-developed social media policy in place to guide employee behaviour in social communities.
3. In the hub-and-spoke (also called the coordinated) model, a team of people who are cross functionally trained are ready to address various social media needs. **This is currently the most popular structure for social media management.**
4. The dandelion model is essentially a multi-layered hub-and-spoke model. It is appropriate for companies with strategic busienss units (SBUs) that still represent a core brand.
* The holistic model is currently the least used. it truly refers to a structure within which all employees are empowered to use social media, use social media, and do so according to the company's strategy.

## SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
* Regardless of the structure a company uses or the policy it develops, it must also devise a day-to-day system for managing social media activities, tracking content from mdevelopment to distribution, managing social ad campaigns, analyzing effectiveness, monitoring and listening, and capturing and analyzing social data for market research. Companies may also use vendors to aid in social customer relationship management (CRM), host owned social sites, generate reviews and ratings, facilitate influencer marketing tactics, and provide content. In particular, companies benefit from incorporating cloud services for social media management, social monitoring and listening, social ad management, and social media analytics and modeling. Whether on a small or large scale, one of the most used systems is Hootsuite, Notably, Hootsuite offers a special program for university users that includes an option to become Hootsuite Certified.

## FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* The framework for social media marketing depicting in Figure 4.6 describes an organization's use of social media marketing along four dimensions: 1) scope, 2) culture, 3) structure, and 4) governance.

* Scope: does the organization **use social media marketing internally and externally to collaborate with stakeholders or is social media predominantly limited to use as an external communications channel?** The answer categorizes organizations as defenders, who use social media marketing primarily as a one-way communication tool to entertain consumers or to inform stakeholders, or as explorers, who seek collaboration with many different stakeholders such as clients, employees, and suppliers.
* Culture: is the organization's culture conversative (traditional with a focus on mass communications) or modern (permeable, open, flexible)?
* Structure: are the organization and departmentalization of the social media marketing assignments hierarchical or networked?
* Governance: does the organization define social media regulation and employee practices (autocracy) or allow norms to develop organically (anarchy)?

* Decisions on social media marketing should be guided by the firm's internal influencers (e.g., general vision, mission, corporate goals, corporate culture, available resources), which in turn should be in line with external influencers (e.g., communities, competition, government regulation). The framework doesn't suggest a right or wrong choice. Rather, depending upon the organization's overall strategic focus and stakeholders, social media marketing should be organized for fit and congruence with the organization's design.

### CASE STUDY
221BC'S SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING STRATEGY
* Thus far, we've defined 221BC's social media marketing objectives and its target audience, and identified influencers it could use to help spread its social media message. In Exhibit4.5, you'll see a complete social media marketing strategic plan for 221BC. Note the major components covered in the plan, including objectives, target market personas, the proposed mix of social media zones, channels, and vehicles, the experience strategy, and proposed metrics.

EXHIBIT 4.5
221BC'S SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING STRATEGIC PLAN
* 221BC Kombucha is a family-owned business, founded and operated by Aneta and Eric Lundquist, that brews and distributes traditionally fermented kombucha. The Lundquists, and those passionate about drinking kombucha, believe that it is a gateway food to a healthier lifestyle. 221BC is a date that represents the origin and evolution of ancient wisdom with the innovation of the present; 221BC is using the most traditional methods of kombucha brewing, while marrying those techniques to the most nutritionally dense of the current superfoods. This social media marketing plan will act as a guideline for 221BC to grow and evolve their current social marketing efforts, which are to increase consumption of 221BC Kombucha and, more importantly, to spread the knowledge about the importance of clean eating.
* The plan will evolve from the existing strengths of the brand; that it is healthy, authentic, craft-made, organic, clean, and empowering. In addition, 221BC recently underwent a branding and creative initiative that will be a consistent basis from which to implement the social plan across platforms. The brand's position is "a belief that balance is the key to living a rich life. 221BC balances the authentic health benefits of traditional pungent kombucha with a modern knowledge of herbs and superfoods to create an appealing flavor and pleasurable bevarage experience" (personal communication). The brand's promise to deliver a product that is made using functional herbs and superfoods, by like-minded people trying to spread a healthy lifestyle.

##### SITUATION ANALYSIS
* 221BC currently operates within a small regional market, mostly Florida, in which is a very large and growing competitive kombucha industry. The size of the industry, and commitment to standards, give 221BC opportunities in the competitive landscape. However, the popularity of the product and the growing numberof kombucha products entering the market increase the threat of decreased market share. In addition, some of 221BC's direct competitors are large, national companies like GT's Living Foods and Health-Ade, which have the human and financial resources for large social media marketing initiativs.

##### SWOT
* The following SWOT analysis captures the key strengths and weakness within the company, and describes the opportunities and threats facing 221BC Kombucha.

##### Strenths
* Traditional fermentation used with no shortcuts--only whole ingredients and no substitutes
* 100% family owned and female founded.
* Owners has a tremendous knowledge about gut health, fermentation, and microbiology.
* Have already solidified brand guidelines and a create style guide.
* Content taht is currently on the brand social channels is professional looking and on-brand.

##### Weaknesses
* no current marketing plan due to limited resources and lack of executive direction.
* Current social presence is inconsistent due to restriction on knowledge and resources.
* Product label doesn't tell the full brand story.

##### Opportunities
* The kombucha market is expected to continue to grow, with kombucha becoming seen as a mainstream beverage and an alternative to soda.
* Fill the information gap left by competitors about how kombucha fits into a larger picture of personal health.
* Potential to launch complementary products that align with the goal of promoting health.
* Kombucha popularity means new consumers entering the market.
* More and more competitors are adding supplemental ingredients while 221BC remains pure.

##### Threats
* Kombucha as a trendy drink instead of a lifestyle commitment.
* National kombucha brands have more market value, brand awareness, and social media marketing resources.
* Kombucha is becoming a saturated marekt; competition has increased, price has decreased.
* Acquiring shelf space is expensive and retaining placement is difficult.

### COMPETITIVE AUDIT
* A competitive audit of the national kombucha industry reveals competitors such as GT's, Big Easy, Dr. Brew, and Bauchi--representing just a portion of the market. These competitors focus efforts on the most popular social channels with image-heavy content related solely to the prodct. The long-term issue with this strategy is that these kombucha brand competitors also alter their final product with extracts, concentrates, and other unnecessary ingredients. In addition, these companies are not focused on sharing broader information about why and how kombucha fits into a healthy lifestyle. The future is in real food with understandable and recognizable ingredients, and in companies that care about the health and knowledge base of their curious consumers; 221BC is already positioned to fit into this new food landscape with a social media marketing strategy that promotes this competitive advantage.

### SELF-AUDIT
* 221BC kombucha is active on Facebook and Instagram, as well as Twitter. Content is about what differentiates their product from those of competitors and the company monitors social posts to provide customer service care via social channels. Frequency of posting across channels is inconsistent; 221BC should aim for one post to Instagram a day and at least two stories, one post to Facebook a day with a blog post share and a live video at least once a week, and posting to Twitter at least once a day. In addition to the three social channels listed above, the company has recently launched a blog called Biome 1.0, which is published predominantly by founder Aneta Lundquist. Aneta wants to create and promote deeper social content, beyond the product, to educate and converse with consumers about the driving force behind the use of the product.
* AAall creative imagery flows from t he recently conducted branding initiative--all logos and themes align with brand creative standards. These pre-set creative guidelines will make producing content easier moving forward. 221BC has dabbled in paid/boosted posts but not consistently or well. In the absence of any current broader marketing and communications plan, the company should divert all advertising funds into social (and search) marketing as it is more cost effective and reuslts are easily measured.

### OBJECTIVES
* Because the kombucha industry is anincreasingly competitive market, the goal of the social media marketing plan is to increase brand awareness through social engagement with the brand by creating a sense of community across all channels focused on education regarding shared health and lifestyle interests. The plan will seek to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Promote the brand's image and position as superior to national brands by communicating how the 221BC product is different from those of competitors.
2. Encourage product trials and faciliate purchases by inviting new consumers to try the product
3. Increase brand loyalty by positioning the brand and Aneta as an "expert" --a provider of information related to the proudct by encompassing teh large real food and healthy lifestyl movement.
4. Connect consumers with each other and encourage engagement.

### TARGET AUDIENCE
* From 221BC's own internal customer data and market research, teh company has pinpointed their target audience and created a customer persona called the Conscious Foodie. She is age 30-54, college educated, middle to upper-middle class, physically active, seeking or pursuing a healthy lifestyle, willing to pay more for quality, has kids, reads labels, and tends to be brand loyal. in addition, the Conscious Foodie is digitally connected, seeks out educational content, is mostly on facebook and instagram, and desires interaction with her favorite brands.
* The secondary target audience is known as the College Health Trend Chaser. She is a college student, age 18-25, prefers to buy products "at a deal" but doesn't mind paying more for quality and health, is a fitness nut (espeically trendy fitness like cycling and yoga), and tends to be less brand loyal. The College Health Trend Chaser is more trend driven to drink kombucha and less likely to find value in the health education and lifestyle driven content of the brand's social offering. She is active on Facebook and Instagram, maybe Twitter, maybe Youtube, maybe Tiktik, and is more likely to respond to meme content.
                
### SOCIAL MEDIA ZONES AND CHANNELS
* 221BC will use paid, earned, and owned media in its social marketing plan. Owned media will consist of the brand's website and the newly developed blog content; blog posts should work to educate customers, communicate the brand story, and position Aneta as the brand ambassador and passionate expert on living a healthy lifestyle, gut healthy, and clean eating. Earned media will include social posting and engagement across the company's current channels of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. 221BC will work in video content by using Facebook Live video before committing to starting and managing a Youtube account. Consistency and transparentcy in messaging regarding product ingredients, recipes, and no-string-attached information will help build trust in the earned media target audience. 221BC will use paid media on social channels; boosting posts toward the specified target market on social media will help amplify the message. Search engine optimization (SEO) efforts will also be used. Content centered on paid efforts should promote trial use and repeat purchase of the product, including coupons and offers, as well as giveaways. The brand will also re-approach working with microinfluencers with an audience both geographically and demographically suited to the 221BC target audience in order to grow the brand community.
* Zones utlized will include social community, social publishing, and social commerce. All zones will be used throughut the year and across brand channels. Social community will be used to share the brand truth and to engage with followers. Social publishing will be used to expand content from just product based to the new goal of being a source of education. The social media marketing plan content calendar will incorporate videos, recipes, health tips, blog posts, and more via Aneta herself and possibly the newly created brand personaity the "Bubbly Buddha", which emerged from recent branding sessions. Social commerce will be used to better proliferate coupons, and offers to consumers who aren't yet awwre of the brand or brand loyal, but could be, as well as to encourage current customers to become repeat buyers.
* Strategic objectives are matched with strategy for achieving those objectives and tactical objectives are matched with a tactical strategy and specific tactic employed. 

### Objective One
* Promtoe the brand's image and position the brand as superior to national brands.

* Live video Q&A with Aneta called "Kombucha for Newbies

### Objective Three
* Increase brand loyalty

Strategy
* Position the owners as brand ambassadors and share their story and passion
* Communicate the 221BC company culture through content.

Tactical Objectives
* Make Aneta a brand and lifestyle "expert" on real food and gut health by having her contribute valuable content via the blog and social channels
* Position 221BC as a provider of information beyond the product

Tactics:
* Publish behind the scenes photos and videos so consumers feel like a part of the product
* Create and publish a recipes and tips content series on the blog (cross-posting the content to social media and using social content to drive traffic to the blog)
* Have Aneta converse and interact with followers who engage with her content

Objective Four
* Connect consumers with each other and encourage engagement

Strategy
* Become a wellness brand with engaged community followers, rather than a company
* Create physical spaces for customers to interact, share information, and experience the product
* Cultivate and share user-generate content, especially as responses to brand content

Tactical Objectives
* Increase social engagement across channels by encouraging tagging and sharing
* Use geographical data to invite top engaging followers to popup events

Tactics
* Work with microinfluencers (look for people with lots of engagement within brand followers)
* Create brand partnerships with related products or influencers like fitness gurus
* Involve followers with #FollowFriday; share them using the product or trying the recipes and tips that Aneta shares on the blog
* Use giveaways to grow followers and increase engagement across social channels

## EXPERIENCE STRATEGY
* 221BC's current content types focus on the product, much like their competitors in the kombucha industry. This sort of content doesn't give the consumer much to engage with from an experience standpoint beyond liking the content. The importance of user-generated content is that it elevates messaging on brand-owned channels and mediums that is audience-centric and not brand- or product-centric. Customers should be inspired to engage fully in content, interact with the brand, and generate their own content to share back 221BC. For example, when Aneta shares tips on a recipe she should encourage blog readers to try making the recipe and to share photos of their end product on their channels, taging 221BC so other followers see the posts. In that way, the social content of the 221BC channels grows beyond the goal of being informative and achieves the goal of being an inspiring community with 221BC and Aneta at the center of it.
* The social experience should also invite followers into the inner workings of the 221BC brand, product, and company. This achieves the goals of elevating the quality of the product above competitors, but it also acts as a transparent way for customers to feel more connected to and involved with the product. Not all creative content has to be polished; working off-the-cuff live videos, short clips, and photo into content can often make branded social media channels seem more real and approachable.

## ACTIVATION
* Create a content plan that will outline content themes, types of content, sample titles of posts, and which channel they should be posted on. Work on more social scheduling to take the strain off your timme resources. You should be boosting at least one post on each channel per week and all social posts that link back to the blog should be boosted.

Budget is 5k/month?

Content Calendar--A sample week of what 221BC should be posting

                * Twitter: Last week: blog post (promote)

Thursday
* Take a few minute to converse with followers across channels and answer comments:

                * Instagram: Share a user post highlighting the 221BC product
                * Twitter: Post a Bubbly Buddha health tip

Friday:
* Post the week's blog to the website:
                * Facebook: Latest blog post (promote)
                * Instagram: #FollowFriday (and #TGIF Giveaway bi-weekly)
                * Twitter: Share a recent positive review of the product

Weekend
* Scehdule out weekend posts so you can take a break
* make Saturday and Sunday posts more product based and simplisitic

Monthly:
* Set aside monthly to complete schedule posts for the month ahead
* Monthly blog series call "Benefit of 'Buch"

Quarterly:
* Promote and host a popup social event where consumers/followers can take their virutal engagement to the real world--also frame these events as a chance to get to meet Aneta
* Live video Q&A with Aneta called "Kombucha for Newbies"

##### Measurement
* The effectiveness of the plan will include measurable goals, including metrics that specifically can be tied back to the tactical objectives. Increase followers on the three current main channels of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Increase engagement on posts across the same channels. Monitor specific metrics on brand new initiatives, including an average increase in blog viewership over the first year it's live and average increase in Facebook Live video views over the first six months in implementation. In addition, increase traffic to the website from both social and search. As the social marketing plan evolves, practice social listening and use social analytics to tweak the content, messaing, timing, and budget of the plan on a monthly basis. 221BC should be prepared to access the success of the plan anually and to expand the scope of the plan as the company grows.

### CASE STUDY (CONTINUED)
* In this chapter, we took an in-depth look at a primary competitor, GT's Living Foods. TD's is a powerhouse brand in the kombucha space and one with superior resources for distribution and marketing. For 221BC to stand out among kombucha fans, it must find a way to distinguish its social media engagement from that of GT's Living Foods and other popular kombucha brands. GT's is involved in all four zones of social media marketing. Because 221BC has fewer resources, we've proposed that it concentrate on three zones of social media: social community, social publishing, and social commerce. For social community, the channels will be Facebook and Instagram. Social publishing will utilize a new blog, called Biome 1.0, for which new posts will also be promoted across 221BC's social community channels. Social commerce will play a role in that 221BC will offer coupons to encourage product trial. The experience strategy is tied to 221BC's mission for its kombucha to serve as a gateway to healthier life. For that reason, 221BC's social media content will focus on providing tips and resources for healthier living. When it comes to social media marketing management, Aneta Lundquist is essentially a team of one, but she still uses Hootsuite to schedule posts, follow brands of interest (like GT's) and monitor engagement. We'll look at more of these details as we cover the remaining chapters of the book, including a deep dive into each of the four zones of social media marketing as well as social media metrics and analytics.

5. How do social media teams manage the roles, tasks, and schedules related to executing social media tactics?

## TACTICAL PLANNING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* In the last chapter you learned how to plan a strategy for a brand's social media marketing. The social media marketing strategic plan may exist independently or may be a sub-plan of an integrated marketing communication plan. When part of a marketing communications (marcom) plan, social media marketing activities will be aligned with other marcom elements such as advertising and sales promotions to amplify the brand's message and/or to activate campaign events. Consequently, many of the tactical decisions mentioned in this chapter, such as establishing brand persona and identifying a creative strategy to guide brand communications, may already be determined. The stories that relay the brand meaning to the target audiences along with existing brand assets may be in place and ready for the social media team to use as a base. Even for new brand launches, brand identity, the pillars that will serve as the foundation for the brand's image and position, and the value proposition it promises to deliver, will be defined as part of the brand's strategic marketing planning process.
* In this chapter, you will learn the process for developing a tactical plan. The **tactical plan** brings the social media marketing strategy to life. There are several practical steps required, **including determining the right channels, content to deliver the desired experience, rules of engagement, and schedule. As if that's not enough, we must also develop processes to create, produce, and deliver the content, conversation, and other experiential elements of our strategy.** In other words, we will address the why, who, where, what, when, and how of social media marketin. With this foundation for how social media marketing is accomplished from a practical perspective, you will see how the strategic decisions interplay as we cover the zones, strategies, and tactical decisions in depth in the next section of teh book.

## WHY: VALUE-DRIVEN SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* **Social media tactic** are the actions taken to execute the social media strategy. **The strategy considers the situation analysis, target audience, and objectives to guide the zones of social media that the brand can best use to reach and engage the target audience. The tactic will guide the brand's activities in the zones of social media marketing, but must do so in a way that fits with the objectives. The objectives are the why--the reasons or purpose for social media marketing.** Table 5.1. reviews possible objectives, the strategy for achieving the objective, and possible tactics. As we saw in earlier chapters, there are several possible marketing objectives that brands use social media marketing to address. The table uses a few of these to demonstrate how we map strategic objectives and strategies to tactical objectives and tactics.

## WHO: UNDERSTANGING AND HONORING THE TARGET AUDIENCE
* Target audience research is a key component of the strategic social media marketing planning process. It provides the insight needed to devise an experience strategy capable of engaging the target audience in the zones of social media. **Engage** is a key word because of the culture of social media. Remember social media are about participation and sharing. The cultural expectation is that participants will interact, co-create, and share, and this expectation exists for consumers as well as for brand participants. For this reason, a social media strategy should be based on an experience. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines experience as 1) direct observation of or participation in events as a basis of knowledge, 2) the fact or state of having been affected by or gained knowledge through direct observation or participation. The Cambridge Dictionary defines experience as the process of getting knowledge or skill that is obtained from doing, seeking, or feeling. **If marketers are to be effective at engaging people, we need to understand what experience might inspire action--inspire the audience to do, see, and/or feel.** Likewise, target audience research will guide decisions of where and when. It will provide guidance on the social media networks and channels the target audience uses as well as the activities they participate in, when they participate, the devices they use, the people and brands they engage, and more. The persona is the characgter description that highlights key information about the target audience. Chapter 2 reviewed the elements of personas in depth and that information became part of the strategic planning process covered in Chapter 4. Here we reply on personas again. It's useful to review the persona or revise it to reflect insights that will guide tactical decisions. Figure 5.1 provides a template for a persona focused on guiding social media tactics.

                What are Their Favorite Types of Social Content?

## WHERE: THE CHANNEL PLAN
* The next decision determines where the brand will engage with the target audience. For simplicity, we are reviewing the process for tactical planning as a linear one. In reality, these decisions are considered in tandem. The culture, guidelines and rules, and functionality (as well as charactertistics of the population membership) of each prospective **channel** will influence **what can and should be shared, how people engage with each other, and choices about the timing and frequency of participation.** In this step, each channel is evaluated for fit. Some of the questions that will facilitate channel selection include the following:

* **Who uses this channel, what are they using it for, and how much time do they spend here?**
* **What are conversations like here? What kinds of content work best here?**
* **Will participation in this channel help us meet our objectives? Does it make sense for our business to use this channel?**
* **What specific goals can be pursued here given the channels' functionlity? Does these goals relate to objectives in our strategic plan?**
* **Can we establish a unique presence and make a valuable contribution to the community? Does our brand image, voice, and tone fit with the **channel culture?**
* **Are our competitiors present here? If so, how are they performing?**
* **If we participate in this channel, what will we contribute? What will we ask fans and followers to do when they engage with us and after engagements? Share? Comment?**
* **Does the channel offer paid media options to ensure audience reach and the ability to target specific audience segments?**

* The characteristics of each channel should be considered. Remember there are several possible **social media channels**. We mention those with the large audiences and aoption rates for marketers, but there are thousands of options available. Depending upon the target audience, the industry, and the objectives for social media, smaller, niche, channels may be effective. Table 5.2 provides an overview of the characteristics associated with several major channels.
* The answers to the questions posed and the evaluation of the characteristics of the channels will facilitate the creation of a **channle plan**. **Table 5.3 illustrates a sample channel plan. It identifies the vehciles the brand will use to reach and communicate with the target audience and summarize the tactics that are recommended for each vehicle. Channel selection influences subsequent decisions on the topics and types of content the brand will create and publish, as well as the volume of brand activity and the forms of engagement the brand will use. Keep in mind that these choices must take in account available resources. The size of the social media team and the budget available for social media marketing will influence the number of channels, the types of content, the sources of content, and the volume and frequency of distribution and promotion of content.**

* Some channels work for both B2B and B2C marketers, while some (like LinkedIn) are best for one more than the other. This is reflected in the channel choices made by B2B and B2C marketers, as shown in Figure 5.2. Channel plans will include any owned media options and paid media purchased on social media sites as well. Figure 5.3 shows the extent of marketers' use of paid media on social media sites

## WHAT: DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE
* What will the brand ask the target audience to do? The answer to this question is the basis for the experience the brand will offer the audience. It must not only enable participation and sharing by virtue of its design, but should inspire the audience to participate and share. It must be consistent with the brand's image and be valuable to the audience. For this reason, the ideal experience can be thought of as one that **captures the sweet spot at which the audience's passions and needs intersect with the brand's identity**. Like advertising, **it must be able to attract attention, break through a clutter, deliver the intended message, and aid comprehension and recall, while positively influencing brand attitudes and purchase intent**. Wait, there's more! It should be **discoverable** so that the brand appears during relevant searches. It should be **authentic** and **conversational** to fit the culture of social media. Finally, it should be **scalable** and **sustainable**. Table 5.4 lists the characteristics of effective social media tactics. That's quite a challege! Perhaps it's no wonder that so little social media marketing efforts earn audience engagement.

* Interactive
* Targeted
* Value-driven
* Authentic
* Participatory
* Distinctive
* Purpose-Driven
* Discoverable
* Symbolic
* Functional
* Experiential
* Inviting

* The design of the experience therefore encompasses several elements: 1) type of **tactic**, 2) **content type**, and 3) **content strategy**, including themes, topics, appeals, source, and style.

## TYPES OF TACTICS
* The experience the brand offers the target audience should align with the relevant zone of social media marketing. In other words, in the zone of social community, the experience should build relationships and will likely include conversation and sharing. In the zone of social publishing, the experience should be informative and/or educational. In the zone of social entertainment, the experience should be entertaining. In the zone of social commerce, the experience is related to shopping and buying. Some tactics are cross-zone while others are not. Table 5.5 describes the tactics marketers use to achieve experience strategies and the related zones of social media. You'll learn more about these tactics as we cover each zone of social media in depth in the next section of the book.


## CONTENT TYPES
* Regardless of the type of tactic or the zone of social media in which the tactic is deployed,  there will be one or more types of content employed. Tactics may require a venue for the audience to interact with the brand, such as an app, widget, bot, or game. Most commonly, tactics rely upon content as the social object with which the audience can engage. A **content type** is an information asset whose attributes distinguish it from all other kinds of content. There are a plethora of content types marketers can use. Some content types include live video, prerecorded video, photos, images, articles, quotes, infographics, announcements, news headines, questions and answers, statements, case studies, e-books, white papers, songs, jingles, games, performances, and more. Don't forget conversations! aS bIZZUKA ceo, jon Munsell, famously said, "If content is king, conversation is queen"

                Serving: 1: Providng customer service on social network channels

* How do marketers choose? Marketers will consider **which types of content are typical for the SNS where the content will be deployed, fit the tactic's strategic intent, are most popular among the target audience (perhaps based on data on engagement rates by content types), are best for relaying brand messages, and are feasibly given the staffing, creative, monetary, and temporal resources of the brand.** Figure 5.4 presents the content marketing matrix which plots content type according to whether the information being delivered in the content type is **emotional** or **rational** and whether the target audience is in a **passive** or **active** stage of the purchase process. Table 5.6 provides assessments for the most commonly used content types in social media marketing on key selection factors suchas interactivity, perceived value, source, production cost, and results.

* CONTENT STRATEGY
* **The specific themes and topics for the content must be identified. Themes may be based on brand values, industry issues, target audience interests, integrated marketing communication campaigns, seasonal events, and more.** The only requirement is that the themes identified fit with the brand, the target audience, and the tactics being employed. The topics will be subcategories of the themes identified. Working with the themes and topics, the team will brainstorm ideas and assign the ideas a title. **Ideas deemed worthy of further development can then be assigned to a team member and tracked through the stages of development, approval, production, publication, promotion, and assessment.**
* The Content Marketing Institute recommends a series of questions to answer in the discovery process for a **content strategy**

* is the target audience actively seeking information about your brand? Is their attitude toward the brand positive? What content or information do they need? Can you help solve a "pain point" in their jobs or lives? What can you offer them that they would care about?
* What differentiating value can your brand bring? What can you develop that is truly different from and more valuable than that of the competition?
* What could we develop that will be synergistic with the brand's overall marketing efforts?
* What do we need to say? What will the target audience be receptive to?
* What content types will be used? Can the content be developed as a series to increase impact? 
* Where will the content be published and distributed?
* What resources do you have already or can you acquire to develop content? Can you syndicate content from existing sources? Can you provide value through curating content from other sources? If original content, do the resources exist in-house? Who in the company has the expertise to help? What internal assets and other content do you already have? What resources (staffing, partnering, vendor services) will you need?

* Note that in addition to devising a creative idea and a rationale for why it should produce content that meets the criteria and will achieve the desired results, the questions include assessing what is feasible. Some social media marketing teams are a team of one; others (such as web designers, copywriters, graphic designers) and **brand assets** (such as video footage, commercials, print ads, brochures, and annual reports) from other division in the company that can be repurposed as **source content**. Other teams will be creating from scratch.
* An additional consideration is the content mix in terms of point of view (POV) or intended beneficiary. Research suggests that people are more likely to engage, and engage positively, when the content posted or shared takes the point of view of the receiver, rather than that of the sender. In other words, the messages should have more "you" focus than "me" focus. When brands share a post that touts the launch of a new product, the focus is on the brand, and if the audience engages, it is the brand that benefits. When a brand shares an entertaining video that brings joy and amusement to the audience, the focus is on the audience, and if the audience watches the video, the audience benefits. See the difference? Industry best practices suggest that the content mix should follow an 80-20 formula such as that 80% of the content is audience-focused and 20% brand-focused. **In other words, for every four social media posts that are *audience-centric*, the brand can share one post that is *brand-centric* or sales-oriented.**
* Table 5.7 illustrates a planning template used in planning content strategy. Sample themes and topics are identified in the column on the left. The planner includes space for the title, content type, creative source, anticipated distribution channels, and production schedules.

===

### PUBLISHING STANDARDS
* The content strategy will likely also include standards for content that ensure everything published and promoted for social media marketing is optimized for effectiveness. For instance, keywords, tags, and meta tags that are relevant for the brand's search engine optimization (SEO) strategy should be emphasized in social media content. Hashtags used for specific brand campaigns or related to seasonal themes will be identified. The standards may include guidelines for title or headline word count, preferred headline words, types of preferred interactivity (e.g., quizzes or polls), links, thumbnails, and so on.

### CONTENT STRATEGY DOCUMENT
* The decisions will be documented in a brief content strategy document, as shown in Table 5.8.

                Table 5.8: A Content Strategy Document Example
                * Tactical Approach: Most content will align with the primary tactics of educating and contributing and secondary tactics of friending and serving: minimal content will broadcast information about our products, pricing, and special offers (80/20)
                * Type: Because our brand offers a high-involvement, high-risk service, credible and detailed information is valuable for preparing the audience to choose a service provider. Videos and articles published on our company blog will be the primary content types. These will be promoted with short, conversational posts in our chosen social channels.
                * Content Theme: Content themes will include 1) brand slogan, 2) empowering decision makers for risky decisions, 3) stressful decisions
                * Content Topics: Videos will relay the stories of customers told in the form of a dramatization. The story arc will engage the viewer in an emotional and well-crafted drama that ultimately delivers a testimonial for our service. The video will be constructed as a series with one episode for every type of situation faced by our clients. These will be supported by a downloadable how-to guide that explains how propsective customers facing similar situations can choose a solution to meet their needs.
                * Suggested topic titles are provided in the content calendar
                * Style: The brand's persona is that of trusted advisor. The brand's voice will reflect a personality that is empathetic, reassuring, reliable, and strong
                * Implementation Standards: All content will have a consistent voice, tone, heading, nonenclature, and editorial style. All content will include a call to action, a link to the company website, and the brand logo

### EXHIBIT 5.1
BRITA'S FILTERED LIFE SERIES INCLUDES #FILTERYOURFEED TWITTER TACTIC
* Brita, a brand known for its ability to filter contaminants out of water, has tied its social media strategy to its core benefit--filtering! The "Filtered Life" campaign, which looks at all the bad stuff that can be removed from human consciousness as a metaphor for what filters do to water, includes the zones of social community and social publishing. The experience strategy relies on tactics based on branded video content and a Twitter app. The app, Filter Your Feed, scans users' tweets and replaces negative tweets with positive messages--like pictures of puppies! The positive messages generate earned media. These organic posts are seeds that help to spread the campaign to others. Users are incentivized to accept the positive posts with an altruistic appeal: Brita will donate $1 to the Cybersmaile foundation, an anti-cyberbullying non-profit, for every negative post deleted and positive post shared. The campaign uses owned media in the form of a microsite at www.brita.com/why-brita/drink-like-you-care, which hosts Brita's content and serves as a social media hub with links to Brita's profiles on several social media channels, including Twitter and Youtube. The app is promoted using paid ads on Twitter and Youtube.

## HOW: PRODUCING AND SHEDULING CONTENT POSTING AND PROMOTION
* The next stage of tactical planning is to establish processes for producing the content identified in the content strategy and a schedule to guide the work flow.

### PRODUCING THE CONTENT
* Each content unit must be created and produced. Teams may use variations of **creative briefs** to document the required characteristics and elements of each content unit. If the content piece is part of a larger campaign, there may be a series of briefs, moving from campaign level to content type to content unit, and for content proejcts that involve multi-media, a content element brief may even be used. The briefs will provide the information the responsible staff member needs to ensure the deliverables meet the associated requirements. The guidelines may be very specific, such as number of words used in the title, inclusion of a short link, use of an image of a specific size, inclusino of campaign hashtags, use of a **call to action**, and so on. A call to action refers to a direct request in a marketing message for a specific behaviour.
* As content is developed, it will be documented and catelogued. This ensures that content can be reused or repurposed in the future. Over time, the team will amass a database of content including posts, tweets, photos, hashtags, articles, and so on. The best ideas will produce content that can be repurposed for several related uses. This is called **atomization**--the content can be partitioned and/or repackaged in several ways while still remaining strategically aligned. Not only is atomization an efficient way to use resourcesw, it also provides message **amplification**. Having related but distinct content on different social channels increases the likelihood that the target audience will be exposed to the message multiple times. This enhance message recall.

## SCHEDULING WITH A CONTENT CALENDAR
* The **content calendar** captures which content is scheduled and prioritized for an organization, generally with an annual, quarterly, monthly, and sometimes weekly view. The most commonly used format is a spreadsheet, built in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Companies that work with Social media Management serivces (e.g., Sprout Social, HubSpot, Buffer) will use calendars integrated into the system. Content calendars help to identify, prioritize, and plan for new- and future-content creation. Calendars will typically include several sheets to accommodate planning for different time periods while maintaining perspective of how the content fits together. For instance, a content calendar may include the following views of the content and calendar:

1. Year-at-a-glance view with seasonal themes and major campaign dates
2. Monthly view of content in production
3. Monthly view of content scheduled for posting by social channel
4. Weekly view of content for posting by social channel
5. Weekly view of daily post schedule by social channel
6. Daily view of social media activity, organized by content or by social channel.
7. Content index

* Figure 5.6 depicts an example of a simple annual view. Figure 5.7 illustrates a typical weekly schedule organized by content and date. Figure 5.8 shows how various elements of the content calendar relate to each other. 
* There is no right or wrong way to organize a content calendar. **If you Google "social media marketing content calendar** you will find several free Excel templates from social media service providers. Different templates woill provide varying levels of detail. All are easily adapted as you gain experience and develop preferences for the calendar planning system that work best for you.
* How you design, share, and access your editorial calendar will ultimately depend on your particular marketing goals and available resources. But at the most fundamental level, we recommend that your calendar includes the following fields:

* The **date** the piece of content will be published.
* The **topic** or **headline** of the content piece
* The **author** of the content
* The **owner** of the content--i.e., who is in charge of making sure the content makes it from ideation to publication and promotion
* The **current status** of the content (updated as it moves through your publishing cycle)

* Depending on your company's specific goals, your content team's workflow, the formats and platforms with which you plan to work, and the volume of content you will be creating, you may also want to tract these elements to help you stay organized and on track over the long term.

* **The channels where the content will be published**: this can include owned channels (such as your blog, Facebook page, website, Youtube page, email newsletters, etc), or you can expand your tracking to include paid and earned channels, as well.
* **Content formats**: Is it a blog post? A video? A podcast? An infographic? An original image? To get more milage from the content you create, consider repurposing it into other formats.
* **Visuals**: speaking of assets, it's important that you don't overlook the appeal tha visuals can lend to your content, both in terms of social sharing potential and overall brand recognition. Tracking the visual elements you include in your content efforts--such as cover images, logos, illustrations, charts--will make it easier to ensure that your work has a signature look and cohesive brand identity.
* **Topic cateogories**: this helps make your calendars more searchable when you are looking to see about which target topics you've already created a log of content--of which you haven't covered often enough
* **Keywords and other meta-data**, such as meta-descriptions and SEOtitles (if they differ from your headlines), will help you keep your SEO efforts aligned with your content creation.
* **URLs**: this info can be archived as an easy way to keep your online content audits updated, or to link to older pieces of content in the new content you create.
* **Call to action**: this helps you ensure that every piece of content you create is aligning with your company's marketing goals.

* The calendar will reflect the intended volume and frequency of activity for each channel in your social media plan. Studies on the effectiveness of posting schedules suggest that brands be active several times each week, spread among each day of the week, with fewer high-value content posts for blogs and video channesl and more brief, conversational posts for social network sites. Ultimately though, the choice should fit with the overall strategy and objectives and the team's capacity to deliver fresh, effective content and social interaction

## ROLES AND WORKFLOW
* A clearly defined workflow will help your team communicate more efficiently, adn it gives everyone something to be accountable for. A **social media workflow** is a sequence of connected steps that enables the organization to act efficiently with minimal overlaping tasks and resources in order to implement the social media marketing plan effectively. A solid workflow helps you and your entire team to:

* understand the big vision behind daily tasks and projects
* know what each person's role and responsibilities are
* complete projects requiring different skills as a team, and
* prioritize time and resources

* Workflows can be incredibly complex, especially for large teams in global companies. Most teams have five or fewer members though, so creating a workflow is manageable and worthwhile. According to Sprout Social, at small companies (one to 50 employees), in particular, 59% of social marketers say they work on team of one to two people. At mid-sized companies with 51-1000 employees, 35% of social marketers work on teams of three to five people; 37% enterprise social marketers work on teams of more than 11 people. To implement a workflow that actually works, follow these steps:

* Figure out exactly what tasks need to be completed for each piece of content you produce and the daily activities required for posting to each channel in the plan.
* Understand what role would be the best for completing each task
* Assign those tasks to the people who fill those roles. When proejcts require skills from multiple people on the team, identify whether the tasks can be completed concurrently on must move forward in linear fashion.
* Assign due dates based on what needs t obe done first, second, third, and so on.
* Hold everyone accoutable for getting their stuff done on time.

### EXHIBT 5.2: 
MANY SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING MISTAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE OF POOR TACTICS
* Marketers make social media mistakes all too ofte. The most common tactical erros fall into these broad categories:
1. posting from the wrong account (personal posts on work profiles and vice versa)
2. mishandling responses when replying to comments
3. creating content that offends the target audience
4. posting content without checking it first
5. promoting the competition
6. sharing too much information
7. auto-tweeting without monitoring for current events
8. co-opting a trending topic for reach
9. responding to trolls

### CRITIAL REFLECTION
STRESS AND THE SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETER
* Being a social media marketer sounds like a dream job! you get to spend most of your waking hours doing other people do for fun! You tweet, you snap, you pin! You show off your creative flair with clever images and witty banter. And that's really all it takes for a brand to build and maintain a successful social media program, right? Not quite. Social media have been described as a beast that requires constant feeding. Constant means always, as in 24/7, 365 days a year. The beast requies it be fed with fresh ingredients and while you are concepting, and prepping, any number of developments might need your attention. The result--stress!
* The Stress in America report, published by the APA, states that 86% of adults in the US experience social media stress. Constant checkers--people who frequently check email, texts, and social media accounts--experience the highest levels of social media stress. Don't worry--there are solutions to reduce social media stress! The answer is to take a "digital detox" from time to time. unfortunately, digital detox isn't really an option for those whose livelihood requires being connected to social media--as it does if you are part of a social media marketing team. While might work for people whose jobs don't require them to be connected virtually around the clock is something social media marketers can only dream about.

### CASE STUDY
221BC'S TACTICAL PLAN
* In Chapter 4, we saw 221BC's strategic social media marketing plan. In Chapter 5, our focus is on the tactical execution of the strategic plan. Following some of the key parameters explained in the chapter, we've explained 221BC's tactical plan in the bales below. Table 5.9 maps 221BC's strategic objectives for strategy, tactical objectives, and specific tactics. 221BC will post daily (and sometimes multiple times per day) to ensure the brand profile is active in organic posts on Instagram and Facebook. These posts will seek to promote the brand, distribute coupons and highlight giveaways, encourage product reviews, and drive traffic to the Biome 1.0 blog.
* Table 5.10 illustrates 221bc'S content strategy docoument. The content strategy document identifies the primary form of content 221BC will use, including images, Instagram stories and video, recipes, and blog posts. Because 221BC strives to use the tactic of educating more so than other tactic, 80% of the content will be focused on educating the audience on wellness topics. The remaining content will highlight the brand and feature proudct images and offer special incentives like coupons that will drive product trial in stores carrying the brand. All of the content will reflect 221BC's brand personality of the "bully Buddha". This brand personality is accessible and engaging while emphasizing the authentic helpfulness intended for the audience.
* Table 5.11 provides some examples of specific content that 221BC will use in its social media activity. Figure 5.10 illustrates a content calendar to guide 221BC's social media posting. One of the tactical objectives will be to build an audience for 221BC's Biome 1.0 blog (part of the brand's social publishing strategy). To accomplish this, the blog will be promoted in some of the social media posts. The photo illustrates an example of a post promoting the blog.

# PART IIIL THE Four Zones of Social Media

# CHAPTER 6: SOCIAL COMMUNITY
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. How do social networking communities enable user participation and sharing?
2. In what ways can brands utilize social networking communities for branding and promotion?
3. How can brands reach consumers organically using social network sites? What characteristics do brand fan exhibit?
4. What forms of paid media can be used in social communities? Why is paid media important to social media marketers?

## THE SOCIAL COMMUNITY ZONE
* In this chapter we drive deeper into the zone of social community, the first zone in our model, shown in Figure 6.1. Recall that all zones in the social media mix are built on social networks, technologically enabled, and based on the principles of shared participation.
* As we plan ,we want to devise a way to encourage customers to participate and to share and to do so within the zones within which we operate. What will invite participation and sharing? That's our experience strategy. Where will they participate and share? Within the zones. Of course, we may use any of the four zones. But in this chapter our focus is on the first zone, the zone of social community. Let's think of zone 1 as the relationship acquiring and maintaining relationships above all else. Conversation and collaboration are the principal activities in this zone, though we often converse and collaborate around content, whether provided by brands, suers, or others. Brand encourage this participation through engagement.

                FIGURE 6.1: Social COmmunity Zones
                Social Community:
                        * Sharing
                        * Socializing
                        * Conversing
                Social Publishing:
                        * Editorial
                        * Commercial
                        * User-Generated
                Social Entertainment:
                        * Games
                        * Music 
                        * Art
                Social Commerce

                        * Retailing/Sales
                        * Human Resources

* Social network sites are the community vehicles that house and enable social engagement. Facebook is the juggernaut of social networks, with the most members worldwide.
*  Social networks are the foundation of social media because every form of social media is based on participation from a community of members. Still, it is useful to compare and contrast social networks and to understand how their defining dimensions affect our ability to market brand within the social space. This is particularly relevant as we see a trend toward users utilizing more social channels for specialized purposes. Social network sites all maintain the basic network structure we discussed in Chapter 3--nodes that interact with one another, flows between node members, and graphs connected to others by way of node relationships. However, social network sites vary in terms of three important dimensions:

                1. Audience and degree of specialization
                2. The social objects that mediate the relationship among members
                3. Degree of openness

### AUDIENCE SPECIALIZATION
* Social network sites can be internal or external, general or specialized. Internal sites are those a specific organization builds for its own use and limits to members of the organization. Rather than hosting several subcultures within a large social network site, an **internet social network** provides a method of communication and collaboration that is more dynamic and interactive. This is a lot like the intranet that many companies provide their employees. Many companies use an enterprise social network as the foundation for their internal, private social netowkr. Enterprise platforms include Workplace by Facebook, Jive, and Yammer. Research shows that the use of ESNs is valuable for engaging employees, building meaningful connections, and enhancing communication. Microsoft uses a network it calls TownSquare, IBM has the BeeHive, and Yahoo! employees meet in the Backyard. In contrast, some external social networks are sponsored by brands.
* Social networks are, of course, about networking--participating in the kinds of activities that enable members to build and maintain their relationships with other people. However, the nature of those relationships also affect the characterization of the social network. Linkedin is a professional social network that emphasizes career experience and the need to maintain connections to those we know professionally. The primary benefit is to be able to call upon one's network when looking for a consultant, employee, job, or other career-related search. There are several professional networks held together by industry, purpose, and personal career goals. Care2 is a social network for people who want to help with social cuases. Focus is a network for business and technology experts. Den provides a social network where architects and designers congregate.
* Just because a social network focuses on personal relationships over professional ones doesn't necesarily mean that it has a broad target. For instance, Jdate.com is a dating social network for Jewish singles. Its mission is social, but it still targets a niche audience. There are several networks designed around specific target audiences defined by demographic charactertic, including age, marital status, income and so on.

### SOCIAL OBJECTS AND PASSION-CENTRIC SITES
* In industry terms, sites designed around object sociality, the ability of an object to inspire social interaction, are known as **vertical networks**. The term describes the narrow, deep focus of social network sites that differentiate themslves because they emphasize some common hobby, interest, or characteristics that draws members to the site. These vertical networks do not attract the same traffic typical of general sites, but one might argue that the members are more involved because of the common interest that initally brought them to the site. They function much like so-called niche markets in the physical world; this term refers to marketplaces that offer a relatively small number of items to buyers who tend to be loyal to these outlets.

### OPENNESS
* Social network sites can be closed, gated communities entirely controlled by the vendor that offers the platform. At the other extreme they can be accessbile to any members or developers who wish to participate. many SNS require new members to register for membership and to use login specifications to access the community. It often makes sense for a social network site to keep a record of membership even if anyone is allow to join. This information can be invaluable for purposes of member management, product development, promoting the site, and utilizing the member data for other purposes. how might social networks utilize member data? it becomes a source for big social datasets, which we covered in Chapter 2. Because social networks have access to vast amounts of detailed data about members' preferences, friends, and activities, they can offer highly targeted ad placements for advertisers. Social network sites may eventually license that data external marketers who could use the data to target potential customers. For now, the social community site with the most data, Facebook, isn't selling member data, but some speculate that it will.
* Marketing in the zone of social community doesn't have to mean marketing on Facebook. But Facebook is the most popular SNS for marketers. Why? That's where the consumers are. Of course, there are other SNS, and brands can build their own online brand communities (OBC), but **social netowrking fatigue** and **social lock-in** help Facebook maintain its dominance. Fatigue is higher when people manage multiple community accounts. The steady streams of content flowing from multiple networks, reaching us even with mobile notifications, add to this sense of fatigue. Social lock-in occurs when a user is unable to transfer social contacts and content from one social network to another. For example, Parler is an alternative to Twitter but its growth is limited by social lock-in.
* One widely discussed solution is to develop a system of **identity portability**  such that a single profile would provide access across social network sites with a single login and shared information. This is the goal of **OpenID**, an authentication protocol that works across participating sites. Unfortunately, OpenID works only on OpenID-enabled sites, limiting the portability for users. Sites can also choose to enable authentication with Facebookk Connect, an option that has been more widely adopted.

## SOCIAL NETWORK ACTIVITIES
* Engagement is the currency of social network sites. How do we interact with others on social media platforms? We addressed this question in Chapter 2. But especially for the zone of social community, the answer has three parts. We mingle, we chat, and we share.
* We can think of social networks as communication hubs; virtually all of them offer users access to a contact list and an interface that makes it easy for people to talk to one another. However, most sites offer more features than these basic ones. The new standard for social network sites is to offer tools, widgets, applications, and features that encourage **social sharing**; sites provide people with the tools they need to reveal elements of their digital identities. These elements include information about us or things that we create--such as our opinions, photos, videos, songs, and artworks. They may also take the form of **secondary content**--things that others create which we feel are worth redistributing to our social networks, such as retweets, links to a celebrity blog, or even brands we "like" on our Facebook page. Mark Zuckerberg, president and CEO of Facebook, said this about sharing: "People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. This is social norm that has evolved over time".
* Social media empower us because all have the capacity to share something if we choose to do so. Some users are creators; they actively produce content in the form of video, podcasts/music, stories and articles, and blog posts. They may publish their own website. Creators are a busy bunch--more than 24 hours of Youtube video is posted every minute. The rest of us may not possess the technical skill or the desire to produce original content. We're happy leaving that work to others--many of whom are professionals. Still, we certainly are avid consumers of the content--Youtube videos along get billions of views every day.
* Remember that analysts estimate that lurkers--those people who consume content by reading posts and watching videos, but who do not contribute to the flow of content--**make up about 90% of any online community**. Although not everyone is a creator who develops artifacts such as videos and podcasts for distribution in their social network, anyone can join a network, update a status, post secondary content from others, and provide feedback on the content others post in their networks. the act of sharing changes this dynamic, because even lurkers can redistribute secondary content to a larger network of people. In this sense even fairly passitve participants can extend their reach well beyond their own social graph. ShareThis, a provider of a widget that enables visitors to easily share content they discover online, found that though almost half of users preferred email for sharing interesting content with others, most of the remainder preferred to use a social media channel to share. Applications such as ShareThis minimize the investment of time and effort necessary to share secondary content on a social network, so it's more likely that content will spread rapidly. This is one of the reasons marketers are attracted to social media as a communication channel. The viral spread of content amplifies the brand's reach, potentially delivering millions of impressions beyond what would have been possible without social sharing.
* A study of social media users found that 75% of people are likely to share content via social media channels. The top three reasons people share content "socially" are because they find it interesting and/or entertaining, they think it could be helpful to others, and to get a laugh. Although the content can be virtually anything you can send in digital form, most people reported sharing family pictures and video, news about family and friends, funny videos, news articles and blog posts, and coupons and discounts.

## MARKETING APPLICATIONS IN THE SOCIAL COMMUNITY ZONE
* As we discussed earlier, the social community zone focus on relationships. Brands can leverage paid, earned, and owned media options in social network sites to meet several marketing objectives, including promotion and branding, customer service and customer relationship management, and marketing research. In social network sites, brands can purchase paid space for advertising and utilize share technologies to further leverage the value of the advertising impressions. They can stimulate earned media, brand-related word-of-mouth communication, by participating and embedding the brand in social communities. Brands seeking a deeper connection to social media users can sponsor a social community or create a dedicated OBC, a form of owned media affect the search engine ranking delivered by search engines such as Google and yahoo! So not only can consumers be influenced by brand interactions and references to brands made by those in their network, they also can be led to branded content via search listings. That's a topic we'll cover further in Chapter 7 when we discuss search engine optimization.

## SOCIAL PRESENCE: BRANDS AS RELATIONSHIP NODES
* Brands must create a **brand profile** within the selected social networking communities in which they wish to command a presence. In this way, the brand acts as a node in the network's social graph. Doing so increases the opportunities for interactions with customers and prospects and also encourages people to talk about the brand with each other.
* Wehn a brand launches a profile on social network sites, the brand exists much as people do on the sites. Just the mere presence of a brand on a social network site results in more positive brand attitudes. Friends can interact with the brands; share information, photos, and videos; and participate in two-way communication. As we discuss in Chapter 4, brands may participate as a corporate entity, as one or more people representing the brand, or as a mascot. Whichever the choice, the brand will develop a profile actor, it should "stay in character". In so doing, the brand is personified. **Brand personification** is defined as "imbuing trademrked or otherwise propietary-named products and services with a human form and/or human attributes, including a general distinctive phyiscal appearance and personality". Even brand mascots, also known as spokescharacters, can achieve the benefits of personifcation. A **brand mascot** is a fictional persona with a distinct personality created to represent a brand; it may include animated characters (e.g., GEICO's gecko) as well as human actors portraying spokescharacters (e.g., Flo for Progressive Insurance). Note that mascots differ from spokespeople, who are human beings endorsing the brand and not a brand-specific invention.
* Building brand personas strengthens brand personality, differentiate brands from competitors, and sets the stage for a perceived relationship. It is a natural expansion of trend for brands to create personalities for themselves, both through the use of creative language--including style, imagery, tone, and creative appeals--and music. Consumers perceive personified brands as active contributors in dyadic relationships. We can see this in the higher engagement rates earned by brands that reinforce their persona in social media. Consumers also respond positively to brand mascots, treating the brand mascots like humans (known as an anthropomorphic response) in their interactions with the brands in social communities.
* Assuming the brand's persona is likeable and credible, it can facilitate **message inernalization** (the process by which a consumer adopts a brand belief as his or her own). When it comes to likeability, brand mascots may be a perfect fit. In addition to physical characteristics, the dimensions of spokescharacter likeability include personality, humor, and consumer experiences. All are dimensions that can serve as a foundation for engaging social media participation.
* What does it take to devise a good brand persona? Brand personas should be consistent with the brand's style guide. Social media are still components of an integrated marketing communications program and, as such, the decision made for the brand's style will still apply. The "voice" of the brand in social channels will need to be consistent, whether the approach is humanized, mascot, or corporate. The social media aspects of the style guide will enable multiple people to create content and converse with fans in the role of the brand. It will ensure that brand representation is consistent. It will include indicators like brand personality traits.
* The personality and fit with the brand overall are clear in all social media communications. Brian Solis (2011), author of Engage!, recommend that brand managers build the brand's social media persona on a foundation of eight decisions:

1. What are the brand's core values?
2. What are the brand's pillars, or social objects that illustrate these values?
3. What has the brand promised to its customers?
4. What are the brand's aspirational attributes?
5. What traits are associated with the brand?
6. What opportunities exist?
7. How does the brand align with the company's overall culture?
8. What stories can help bring the brand's personality to life.

* There is a lot of clutter and fragmentation in social media. It can be hard for a brand's voice to be heard. There are sevearl applications that can help brands analyze their social profiles and identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. Some examples incude Meltwater and Mention.

## BRAND PARTICIPATION AND FRIENVERTISING
* The most social brands in the world might already be among your "friends". Many social network users like, friend, or fan brands. The most popular brands include Starbucks and Coca-Cola. And who could resist being friends with Oreo cookies? that's a friendship taht lasts a lifetime. These brands maintain a social presence in online communities as they invite people to interact and sahre content related to the brand.
* In the early years of social media marketing, brands joined social network sites as a supplemental way to reach  their target audiences. Just as you see your friends' posts in your news feed, you also see the posts of brands you "like", "friend" or "follow". Brands simply had to get people to friend the brand and--voila!--brand messages would reach those people in their news feeds. Because brands don't pay SNS for their profiles and their posts, social media was perceived as a free media channel. Facebook defines the number of people you can reach for free by posting as **organic reach**. Brand participation in social network sites enables brands to share information about brand benefits and special deals, provide customer care, and build relationships by engaging in conversations with consuemrs in the community. Of course, these benefits aren't truly free-social media participation requires an investment of time. Still, compared to traditioanl advertising costs, participating in social communities is a low-cost supplement for brands to reach consumers.
* Brands earn value in social media when they engage consumers over time (relationship marketing) and when they encourage consumers to interact with the brand and share those interactions with others. Brands stand to benefit from heightened brand loyalty among engaged consumers and a more expansive reach for brand-related messages. The **earned reach** (the breadth and quality of contact with users) gained when people share positive brand opinions and branded content with others is invaluable because of the influence attributed to individual, personalized brand endorsements. Does this lead to sales? Yes--59% of social media users report that social media influences their purchases. We're talking about the power of word-of-mouth communication, as we discussed in Chapter 3. But first, how can brands grow their network of friends/followers/fans?
* At a minimum, brands want consumers to friend, follow, or "like" the brand's social presence. Do consumers make friends with brands? According to Sprout Social, a leading social media management company, 86% of social media users have friended a brand. Social media relationships between brands and consumers are one of many factors that may influence purchase decisions, but active engagement in social channels is related to positive brand attitudes and purchase intentions. When people feel connected to a brand, 68% say they are likely to recommend the brand to a friend and 76% say they are likely to choose the brand over a competing one. Whydo people friend brands. Figure 6.2 illustrates the top reasons. Perhaps it's not surprising to see taht interest in brand products and a desire to find deals and incentives top the list. But 20% of people want a connection with the brand. In other words, they want a relationship.

### POST CONTENT AND TYPE
* While a brand's friends are open to brand communications in social communities, brands need to carefully consider what they choose to post. Studies of brand activities and firm-generated content (FGC) in social communities suggest that many brands treat social media much as they would other forms of broadcast media, posting brand information and offers. Gallaugher and Ransbotham's (2010) 3M Model of social media dialogue management is useful for conceptualizing approaches to FGC. The 3M are Megaphone (company broadcast posts), Magnet (firm posts that invite consumer engagement), and Monitor (posts that reflect listening and responding to consumer conversations). To date, research suggests most brands use social media as a megaphone, overlooking the value of magnet and monitor posts. Unfortunately, studies also clearly demonstrate that consumer engagement (in the form of "likes", shares, and comments) is higher for brand posts that are interactive (e.g., posing a question) and consumer-focused, rather than brand-focused (i.e., audience-centric versus brand-centric). For instance, a study of engagement effective for Facebook posts from 800 brands found that **posts could be categorized as informative (e.g., product features and price offers) or persuasive (e.g., emotional or philanthropic). Informative content reduced engagement, while persuasive content increased post engagement.** Even brand mascots are guilty! Their posts are primarily brand endorsements and shares/retweets of other user content. Without persuasive messages, brands minimize the amplification effects they could generate if their audiences found the FGC worth sharing with others.
* Brands are using multi-media posts, especially photos and videos, to enhance post attractiveness and generate consumer engagement, but media type and design aren't the only factors influencing consumer responsiveness. The purpose of FGC and its orientation (audience-centric or brand-centric) matters too. The implications? Consumers don't want to see brand posts that they perceive to be simply another form of advertising. They want authentic, relevant content taht relates to the community context of conversation and socialization.
* Engagement is even stronger when brands incorporate experiences into their social media activity. Brands that incorporate experiential opportunities generate significantly higher levels of "likes", shares, comments. This is why we emphasize the importance of identifying an experience as a part of the social media strategic planning process in Chapter 4.
* How are brands performing? The State of Social Engagement Report studies 85 brands across six social communities. According to the report, 95% of brands are stuck in "broadcast" mode, using social channels as a megaphone. Fewer than 40% of the brands studies ever asked questions of their followers or responded to their follower's comments to the brand. Only 2% of brands consistently responded to customers' posts. Not only is this approach less effective, it can drive brand followers away. One of the top reasons people give for unfollowing a brand in social media is too many promotional messages.

## BRAND ENGAGEMENT
* How do social network sites encourage participation and sharing by members? They make sharing engaging and they make it easy. Brands enhance participation by providing experiences for users that are worth participating in and telling others about. Experiences may involve any of the four zones, but the zone of social community is where conversations take place in and around the experiences.
* **What does it mean to engage? People differ on their explanation of this. In all likelihood this is because engagement means different things. Just as being satisfied might mean being satisfied across a host of specific areas, being engaged may also mean being engaged in a variety of ways. Still, that's what we must do. Engagement is the very essence of social media. Without it, social media might as well be television. Engagement is the heart of it all.
* A simple view of engagement is that of consumer response to FGC in social channels. While this is perhaps the least valuable form of engagement, even this is difficult for brands to accomplish. A study of popular brands on Facebook (including Tide, Cheerios, Honda, and others) calculated the percentage of the fan base that participated with the brand. As we learned, brands can do a better job of interacting and offering relevant FGC. Figure 6.4 reveals the social media behavior that people want to see from brands.

                Figure 6.4: What people Want to See from Brand Social Media Engagement
                * Social media behaviours that help brands connect with consumers:
                        * Like or respond to a consumer
                        * Showcase the brand's personality
                        * Support a cause the consumer personality supports
                        * Participate in relevant conversations
                        * Highlight industry or category trends
                        * Create strong online communities
                        * Invite user-generated content

* Not all of the relevant factors are within a brand's control, though. Participation is also tied to privacy concerns, use of the Internet to search for information prior to purchase, use of social media for socializing and entertainment, and time spent on SNS.
* Engagement takes many forms. From a customer perspective, engagement means customers' behavioural manifestation toward a brand or firm ,beyond purchase, resulting from motivational drivers. How do customers behave when they are engaged? They may exhibit positive word-of-mouth behaviours, provide recommendations, help others make decisions. As we discussed in Chapter 3, word-of-mouth communication is critical for brands. It is perceived as trustworthy and credible, and substantially more so than advertising messages. A study of the impact of word-of-mouth communication and FGC for 60 brands found that WOM influenced brand equity, brand attiudes, and purchase intent, while FGC alone only facilitated brand attitudes.
* Brand engagement, of course, may encompass many levels from mild to evangelistic, and brand should seek to grow fans at the lower levels, investing in them so they become true fans. Brands can develop fans by helping them move from lower levels of engagement to higher ones. The higher the engagement the more positive outcomes for the brand in terms of positive word of mouth, enhanced perceptions of brand equity, and possibly sales. All of those positive benefits of engagement occur when brands are able to encourage people to become brand fans.
* We can think of engagement as a continuum. At one end, people may affiliate with a brand online simply because they want to acknowledge the brand. For example, you might afilliate with Oeros because you have nostalgic connection to the brand based on childhood experiences. It doesn't mean that you plan to buy Oreos now or that you are otherwise engaged with the brand. At the other end, affiliates may want to interact with a brand in meaningful ways, perhaps even working with the brand to develop new products and services. Lego fans, for instance, are infamous for their high levels of brand engagement. Brands with strong fan bases even build museums for fan visits! Cadbury, Ben&Jerry's, Tabasco, Volkswagen, and Crayola have all provided a physical desination for passionate brand fans. And somewhere in between are fans who want special fofers and find they benefit from branded content.
* Why might people engage with brands? One possible reason is the aspirational value of brands in people's lives. Brands help people build their ideal selves and engagement with the brand online is a path to that self. In other words, the brand is a reflection of the fan's idealized self. That's just what PhaseOne Communications found in a study of 75 brands across six vertical markets. They concluded that users engage with brands based on how they wish to be perceived by their own social graph. Research suggests that increasing brand knowledge and emotion increases the perceived value of the brand in the mind of consumer. As a consumer's knowledge increases, so too does his or her emotional attachment to the brand.

### BRAND FANS
* Brands can purposefully cultivate **brand fans**. The word fan refers to a person who is enthusiatic about something or someone. Fans display their loyalty and affection for celebrities, sports team, and musicians in the physical world when they buy T-shirts or other licensed products, join fan clubs, and flock to concerts or stadiums. In a social network, a similar display of loyalty may be as simple as clicking Facebook's "like" button and "joining" a sponsored page in the networking site. An online fan community is a **fandom**.
* The brands with the strongest social following around the world include:

* Coca-Cola
* Red Bull
* Converse
* Samsung Mobile
* Nike Football
* Playstation
* Starbucks
* Oreo
* Walmart

* Curious how your favorite brand stacks up across the major social channels of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube? Visit www.socialbakers.com to search its free social statistics area.
* For brands to truly leverage social networks as places to build relationships with customers, fan relationships should strive to mimic those found among strong fan communities such as Trekkers and Trekkies (members of the Star Trek fandom) and HOGs (fans of Harley Davidson). Random House's Figment is an example of an owned social community; it targets teens who love to read and write fan fiction. Fans who define their own individual identities at least in part by their their membership in a fandom share five key characteristics.

1. Emotional engagement: the object is meaningful in the emotional life of the fan. For example, members of Figment see fan fiction as a part of their self-concept and their membership in the social community as part of their social identity.
2. Self-identification: the fan personally and publicly identifies with life-minded fans. Figment members call themselves "figgies" and use #figgies when interacting on social media channels other than Figment community platform.
3. Cultural competence: the fan has a critical understanding of the object, its history, and its meaning beyond its basic functionality. Figgies are fan fiction enthusiasts who know the development of the gene, the stories of successful fan fiction authors, and more.
4. Anxiliary consumption: the fan collects and consumes related items and experiences beyond the basic object. For figgies, items related to their favorite books, movies, and celebrities are desirable. Figgies might attend fan fiction conventions, going in costume!
5. Production: the fan becomes involved in the production of content related to the object. Figgies post their fan fiction stories on Figment where other fans can read, critique, and contribute to the stories.

* Figment is considered one of the most successful brand communities. Despite the presence of all five fan characteristics, the weakness for Random House is that the fans are truly passionate about fan fiction--not about Random House. Brands that inspire brand love may experience more benefits than those who sponsor a community dedicated to a separate fan passion.
* Are the fans being amassed by brand community, or just brand users who are willing themselves by their participation in a brand community, or just brand users who are willing to acknowledge some affiliation with a brand? It's so easy to like, follow, or become a fan. Liking a brand is an easy, low-involvement step and it's one that frequently comes after exposure to an ad requesting a "like" as a call to action. Can these fans develop brand love? Maybe, but research suggests that brand fans join brand communities because they already like or love the brand, not the other way around.
* The **fan base** is an indicator of the brand's success in establishing a known presence within a community. But to build brand equity and lasting loyalty, brands need more than brand awareness and recognition or even brand affiation. As brands embrace social media marketing, they acknowlege that a strong relationship exists between brand and customer when the customer has a high level of brand engagement.
* Brands can also leverage fans to get new fans. Fan activity on social profiles can engage new fans.
* Level of engagement makes a big difference in terms of the buying decision process. One study specifically measured the value of being a brand's Facebook fan. It found that people spend about $72 more on a product for which they have a social network affiation than for one they do not. Fans are also 28% more likely than non-fans to continue using a brand, and 41% more likely to recommend a fanned versus non-faned product to a friend. Fans in the study also said they felt connected to their brands.
* Importantly, brands that use social media to develop a relationship with customers need to find ways to provide a **return on emotion** for the fans. Return on emotion conceptually assesses the extent to which a brand has delivered a value in exchange for the emotional attachment fans have awarded it. Traditionally, the relationship between brand and consumer is asymmetric, with more effort invested by the fan. One industry study suggests that for brands to succeed as social friends to consumers, building heighened engagement and loyalty, consumers must feel that their efforts are reciprocated and the relationship is symmetric. To do so, brands should socialize with fans and participate in conversations using a credible and authentic brand voice.
* Ultimately, this social media marketing approach seeks to drive awareness and liking of brands while also building earned media. As we suggested earlier, brands should use social spaces to give consumers reason to share positive stories and product information. To encourage this, brands can offer branded assets such as downloads, shareable widgets and wallpapers, and invitations for consumers to co-create branded content. Brands should also be sure to provide value to the fans by using the branded page as an information hub to announce new products, company news, contests and promotions, and career opportunities. Perhaps most importantly, brands should respond to fan questions and posts. Let's take a look at three key strategies brands can use to engage consumers in their social communities: conversations, real-time marketing, and contests and requests for user-generated content.

### EXHIBIT 6.3
BRAND PROFILES CREATE PRESENCE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT
* Brands develop their profiles within the confines of social vehicle. That's why a brand profile isn't truly owned media, which is under complete control of the brand. Still, brands can leverage the features of different social vehicles to develop a meaningful social presence. Zara is a good example. It posts often and focuses posts on fashion trends. It maintains a Lookbook app within the profile for fans to use to stay up to date on the latest styles. The interactive app includes photos and videos and is optimized for mobile.

* Puma engaged fans by inviting them to submit UGC images of its customers modeling their #fentyx line designed by Rihanna. From videos, Gifs images and user-generated hashtag content, Puma heightened visibility of the UGC using "social walls" installed in select locations like Puma's London headquarters. The engagement strategy gave Puma's brand fans a chance to show off how they use Puma products and relate to the brand by serving as an everyday endorser.

### CONVERSATIONS: BRAND TALK
* When we say "brands talk", we mean they talk! That's right. If brands want to engage consumers in conversation, they have to converse. Can this approach be effecctive? Apparently so. That is, if the most popular brands on Twitter are any indication. Brands like Charmin, GE, and Major League Baseball delight Twitter followers with clever, witty banter and multi-thread conversations with fans.
* The Sprout Social Index 2019 explored what types of conversations people want brands to engage in. Figure 6.5 highlights the top topics

                Figure 6.5: What people Want Brands to Converse About on Social Media

                Topics brands discuss on social media that make consumers feel more connected to them.
                * Products and/or services: 68%
                * Social good initiatives: 46%
                * Consumer's of fans: 46%
                * Business performance: 45%
                * Important issues facing society: 40%
                * Employee features: 39%

### REAL-TIME MARKETING (RTM)
* What is real-time marketing? It's kind of like social media conversation on the fly. Brands post messages that resonate with the moment, whether that moment is planned or spontaneous. As we discussed earlier, brands can provoke conversation in social networks. With RTM, the brands leverage current events to do so. These messages have a short life-span. Heinz ketchup used its social media fan base to hijack Super Bowl advertising--garnering engagement while eschewing the $5 million ad placement during the big game. A few days before game day, Heinz launch a tongue-in-cheek campaign with the hashtag #SMUNDAY to petition for the Monday after the Super Bowl to be made a national holiday. The petition pointed out that on average 16 million people call in sick for work on the Monday after the Super Bowl. An RTM message is sometimes even shorter than the typical 30-second advert! But it works because of its timeliness and relevance.

### EXHIBT 6.4:
OREO'S TWEET SPARTK RTM TREND
* What about a spontaneous example? Oreo is the king of RTM, perhaps even being the first brand to incite the use of this technique. During the 2013 Super Bowl, game play halted during an unexpected power outage. Oreo's digital agency, 360i, responded fast, tweeting a picture iwth the caption, "You can stil dunk in the dark". Even though Oreo had no paid advertising during the broadcast, it was able to leverage the experience in real time to share its brand mesasge.

### CONTESTS AND REQUESTS FOR UGC
* Brands can seed many forms of content in social communities as they try to boost engagement and sharing. One of the most popular tools in the **user-generated contest campaign** (also known as a UGC contest). UGC campaigns offer a way for brands to invite consumers to engage and interact while they develop shareable content. The lexicon of online marketers includes many commonly used phrases and accompanying acronyms related to user-generated content, also known as consumer-generated media. **Consumer-generated media (CGM)** or UGC are the catch-all phrases for user content. User content is organic when its creation is motivated by an intrinsic intent on the part of its creator rather than incentivized or guided by the brand itself. Organic brand-oriented UGC, at least when promoting the brand in a favorable light, is valuable and suggests highly engaged customers. For example, a Youtube video espousing one's love for one's iPad is organic UGC--Apple didn't invite or incentivize the fan to create and post the content.
* Is it effectve? According to the Nielsen Consuemr Trust Index, 92% of consumers trust UGC more than advertising. Studies show that user-generated social media communication positively influences brand equity and attitude toward the brand and contests are a tried and true method for generating that communication. A comparison of movie ticket sales among groups who were exposed to a movie-themed microsite, a social media contest for the movie, or both, found that using both as a combined approach was most effective.
* A UGC campaign is sometimes called **participatory advertising**. Brands invite content, set mandatory guidelines and specifications, and possibly also provide participants with selected *brand assets* such as footage from prior commercials that ran on TV. Brands must pay attention to vehicle rules. Whether the campaign will run on Pinterest, Instagram, or Facebook, each vehicle has published guidelines. UGC contests encourage people in the target audience to develop and submit content related to the campaign. The content is then shared on social sites in the form of a **gallery**, which others can view and pass on to their respective networks.
* UGC contests engage consumers and spread the message by leveraging consumer networks. It takes work to organize and oversee the process and promotion to activate these contests, but on the other hand they provide interesting content at a relatively low cost to the brand--especially compared to what professional advertisers charge to create commercials! Depending upon the contest design, UGC contests can also offer ways to engage different types of consuemrs--creators, joiners, conversationalists, collectors. In addition, they provide content for journalists to include in stories about teh brand, so ultimately this enhances a brand's publich relations profile.
* The most frequently used manifestation of UGC is the request for a personal story and/or photo. For example, in the Hanes campaign, "Undercover Color" women shared the color of their underwear on Twitter. The campaign tied in with the brand's core product and also related to the target audience, because a woman's color choice is a reflection of her personality and mood. Another variation is the "create your own ad" contest, which has been used by numerous brands, including Frito-lay, and Chevy. Sponsors encourage submission with incentives such as prize money or the chance for the winning entry to be broadcast on television.

## BRAND SOCIAL COMMUNITIES
* Ultimately, brands can develop and engage communities (called an **embedded brand community**) using existing SNS like Facebook or develop their own independent, online community (called an **online brand community** or OBC). While brands can create such communities independently or within an existing SNS, Facebook Groups has been a recent choice for engaging brand fans in a unified social space. Regardless of the approach, community management is a critical part of optimizing marketing outcomes. The State of Social Engagement Report scored 85 brands on the quality of their social community engagement, including several categories: 1) cohesive social channel strategy, 2) active community management, 3) content mission, quality, and storytelling, 4) engagement and community relationship building, 5) collaboration with influencers, adn 6) amplification efforts. Content missions were used to capture  the value content provided to community members, such as education, customer support, entertainment, philanthropy, special offer, or sales appeal. Community relationship building included communicating with members, responding to their posts and doing so quicly and effectively. Few brands in this study were truly engaging. In fact, 51 of the 85 brands scored <=50% of the possible points. only three brands scored above 80%. Spring, Pfizer's Meningitis Community, and AT&T. The bottom line? Brands can benefit from social media participation, and especially from brand communities. But brands have room for improvement to fully benefit from the organic value in the zone of social community.

## PAID MEDIA IN SOCIAL NETWORK SITES
* Just as brands may advertise on websites throughout the web, they may also choose to advertise within social commynities. Marketers invest more than $84 billion per year on paid advertising in social network sites. Facebook captures nearly 70% of that ad spending.
* Organic brand impressions are more influential are credible than paid impressions. In a nutshell, people who see Facebook impressions organically are measurably mroe likely to take actions on the web. So why are marketers investing in paid ads in social media? In a word--algorithm. Today, the algorithms SNS use to deliver content in member news feeds make it more difficult for brand messages to reach their fans. News feeds were once chornological, but over time, SNS began using algorithms to deliver news feed posts that are customized for each user. Facebook's algorithm is based on thousands of variables designed to assign a **relevancy score** for each piece of content that could be exposed to a user. For users, the result should be a better overall experience. You should see more of the type of content you've liked in the past from people and brands you've interacted with. Mark Zuckerberg explained: "Our goal is to build the perfect personalized newspaper for every person in the world". According to Zuckerberg, the average Facebook member only sees about 100 posts a day on their news feed, even though more than a thousand posts are being contributed from our network during that time period.
* This is bad news for marketers. What percentage of people will see organic posts? Studies suggest that organic reach averages less than 5%. Figure 6.6 illustrates this relationship. In other words, even a brand with a million fans will only reach 20,000 of the fans with each post. Obviously, this makes it more difficult for brands to meet their reach objectives for marketing messages, but it also means less engagement--fewer "likes", comments, shares and ultimately fewere conversions, leads, and customers. The situation is expected to worsen. Facebook has warned brands to expect zero organic reach in the near future.
* That's the major reason companies are turning to paid media options in SNS. These ads may take the form of standard display or video ads, ads in mobile apps, or may be more integrated (and less intrusive) in the form of native advertising. Paid ads in socical networks can be targeted using geographic segmentation, demographic segmentation, psychographic, and behavioural targeting. Remember the member prfoile data and behavioural data captured from social footprints? SNS use that data to provide advertisers with advanced targeting techniques. Facebook's targeting capabilities have gotten considerably better over the past few years. Marketers can reach their ideal target persona based on demographics, interests, web behaviour, and more. Companies can merge email addresses from their customer databases and website visitor data to target social media users directly--an option called **custom audiences**. Facebook offers targeting of **lookalike audiences**, which match the characteristics of known customers. A popular technique is to use targeted ads to "retarget content", also called remarketing. People who have visited a company website before are served an ad for the product on Facebook. In addition to targeting, SNS provide tracking and effectiveness reports for advertisers. you'll learn more about these reports in Chapter 11.

## ADVERTISING TYPES
* **Display ads** may include text, graphics, video, and sound, much like traditional print ads and commmercials, but they are presented on a website. Table 6.1 presents an overview of the advertising options for the major SNS, including pros and cons, cost per thousand (CPM), and specific options. Whether the ads are text-oriented (e.g., a classified ad in a newspaper), text and graphics (e.g., a print ad in a magazine), or rich media (e.g., a television commercial), digital display ads are enhanced with a **response device** in that viewers can click the ads (called a **clickthrough**) to reach a target landing page. A **landing page** is the first page that a person sees when he or she clicks through an ad to reach a brand's target site. It's an important page for marketers, in that the content on the landing page will influence whether visitors stay at the site or move on to another page. Of course, there are many variations for social media advertising such as instagram Stories.

                Table 6.1: Advertising Options for the Major SNS

* Display ads that are designed to have the look and feel of the website on which they are placed are known as native ads. eMarketer estimates that native advertising in social network sites will surpass $52 billion in 2020. The Interactive Advertising Bureau defines **native advertising** as "paid ads that are so cohesive with the page content, assimilated into the design, and consistent with the platform behavior that the viewer simply feels that they belong". The advertising content is delivered "in-stream", as though it is organic content shared by members of the social network site. Because the ad content flows naturally alongside organic content on the social network site, it doesn't interrupt the user experience the way traditional advertising does. For this reason, native advertising is thought to be less irrating and more effective. Sponsored posts in Facebook, featured videos on Youtube, and promoted tweets in Twitter are example. Though ad design is always evolving to leverage technological capabilities, current types of native advertising include in-feed, paid search, widgets, promoted listings, in-ad native elements, and custom. Native ads can evaluated on five characteristics using the IAB Native Advertising Evaluative Framework. Each characteristic represents a continuum ranging from most to least harmonious given the context and capabilities of the website where the ad will be placed.

                Table 6.2: IAB Native Advertising Framework

                CHARACTERISITIC: DESCRIPTION: DEGREE OF HARMONY--HIGH: DEGREE OF HARMONY--LOW

                Form: How does the ad fit with the overall page design? Is it the viewer's activity stream?: In-stream ad delivery: Out of stream ad delivery

                Function: Does the ad function the same as other types of content experienced on the site?: Matches site content: Does not match site

                Integration: How well does the ad match the surrounding content in terms of behaviour? : Mirrors site behaviours: Does not mirror site

                Buying & Targeting: Is the ad placement targeted or run of network? : Narrowly targeted: Broadly targeted

                Measurement: Is the ad designed for bradning (and evaluated on engagement metrics) or direct response (evaluated on conversion metrics): Brand engagement metrics: Direct response metrics

* Native advertising isn't unique to social media, or even digital media. Advertorials have long been a tactic used in print media to integrate paid ads with editorial content. Like advertorials, native advertising must be labeled with a disclosure that the content is an ad rather than organic content. Why? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits deceptive practices, including advertising that misrepresents or omits information that is likely to mislead a consumer, acting in a reasonable situation. Native ads seek to be harmonious with the context of the site in which the ad is placed. The result is essentially a disguise--the ad appears as though it is impartial content. As such, consumers may respond differently than they might if they knew the content was sponsored. For this reason, the FTC developed a guide for businesses using native advertising. The bottom line? Ads must be transparent. If the ad design disguises the ad's identity, a clear and prominent disclosure must be provided. A reasonable consumer should be able to distinguish what content is paid advertising and what is site content (whether editorial or organic, user-generated content). Common disclosures include labels such as "advertising", "sponsored", "brought to you by", and so on. Despite the use of disclosures, research suggests that most people can not distinguish between native advertising and other site content. In one study, just 8% of participants recognized native ads, even though the ads were labeled. When participants recognized ads as such, they tended to evaluate the ad content more negatively

### ENHANCING PAID ADS WITH SOCIALITY
* **Social ads** are online display ads that incorporate user data in the ad or in the targeting of the ad and enable some form of **social interaction** within the ad unit or landing page. In these applications, user data are harnessed to deliver ad messages that are relevant to the recipients based on their characteristics and online behaviours. These ads often customize the ad content; they may even incorporate references to friends of the target. The ads are personalized using details from user profiles, images, relationships among users, data gathered from applications, and interactions within a user network. Like other online display ads, they incorporate a response device, enabling interested viewers to click through to a landing page (which could be the brand's social profile). Personalized social ads enhance perceived ad relevance, brand attitudes, click intention, and ad recall. There are variations of social ads.

1. A **social engagement ad** contains ad creative (image and text) along with an option to encourage the viewer to engage with the brand (e.g., a clickable "like" button or a link)
2. A **social context ad** includes ad creative, an engagement device, and personalized content.
3. **Organic social ads** are shared on a person's activity stream following a brand interaction (such as liking the brand). Organic social ads occur only after a brand interaction and are thought to carry enhanced credibility.

* When organic social ads, also called **derivative branded content**, are triggered with social engagement or context ads, effectiveness improves. A limitation is that organic social ads occur only when community memebers have interacted with the brand's social ads, on the brand's own profile, or with some branded application or game. If few people choose to interact, few organic social ads will be generated.
* Paid media is a valuable communication method for ensuring that target audiences are exposed to brand messages. The advertising communicates the message but the design enables social network users to engage with the ad and share the ad with their own social network. As such, the paid ad acts as a **seed**, capable of propogating additional impressions as it is shared. Of course, marketers can also seed social media marketing efforts in other ways as well.

## ELEMENTS OF AD DESIGN
* Although advertising can inlude photos and videos, interactivity such as in-ad mini-games, links, and text, the typical Facebook ad includes six elements, as depicted in Figure 6.7. The most popular type of ad on facebook (75% of all Facebook ads) is the Page Post Link ad. **The most popular words used in Facebook ads are you/your, free, now, and new.** These words naturally attract audiences by emphasizing the consyumer point of view, highlighting value, and suggesting urgency. Ads should include a call to action. **The most popular CTA are "Learn More", "Shop Now", and "Sign Up".** The CTA invites the audience to interact with the ad, delivers interested customers to the brand's landing page, and provides a way to measure ad response.

1. Headline--the main title of the ad, the headline must grab attention using fewer than 250 characters
2. Text--a short preview description about the product or site
3. Description--information about the brand, product, or offer
4. Caption-- alink to the brand's website URL
5. Call to action--a button showing people where they should click
6. Image--an enticing picture related to the brand or product.


### CRTIICAL REFLECTION
DEEPFAKE THREATEN SOCIAL MEDIA TRUST
* While privacy online remain a concern, another frightening development may be cause for even greater concern. That is the presence of so-called "deepfake". Deepfakes are videos published online that have been augmented to make it appear that someone is saying and/or doing something they did not actually say or do. Some examples of this have included adding celebrities' images to pornographic videos, and even US politicians confesing to various discretions. The problem is that the videos look so real they could trick viewers! The technology is still developing but it won't be long before it will require an expert to distinguish between a deepfake and legitimate video documentation. You can try this too! App exist that make it possible for you to digitally place your own images into movie and TV show scenes.
* For example, ByteDance, TickTok's parent company, offer technology that lets users insert their own images into videos starring someone else. TechCrunch reported that ByteDance's app has an unreleased feature called Face Swap that enables the creation of deekfake videos. ByteDance isn't the only player in the deepfake space. Several other companies have contributed to technology that supports the consumer creation of deepfake videos. For example, the app Morphin lets users overlay one's own face on actors' images in existing GIF files. Watchful.ai co-founder and CEO Itay Kahana told TechCrunch, "These deepfake app might seem like fun on the surface, but they should not be allowed to become trojan horses, compromising IP rights and personal data, especially personal data from minors who are overwhelmingly the heaviest users of "TikTok to date".
* Analyzing videos from around the web, a company called Deeptrace determined there are nearly 15,000 deepfake in existence, a substantial increase from the 8,000 deepfakes found a year earlier.
* Facebook plans to establish new safeguards for detecting deepfakes in order to prevent ethical and legal concerns associated with a growth in deepfakes on its social network sites.
* In fact, Faceboij announced a deepfake challenge to researchers at academic institutions to find and establish better methods for determining false video content. As explained by Facebook:

                The goal of the challenge is to produce technology that everyone can use to better detect when AI has been used to alter a video in order to mislead the viewer. The Deepfake Detection Challenge will include a data set and leaderboard, as well as grants and awards, to spur the industry to create new ways of detecting, and preventing media manipulated via AI from being used to mislead others. The governance of the challenge will be facilitated and overseen by the Partnership on AI's new Steering Committee on AI and Media Integrity, which is made up of a broad cross-sector coalitation of organizations, including Facebook, WITNESS, Microsoft, and others in civil society and the technology, media, and academic communities.

* Facebook allocated $10 million to fund the deepfake research, which includes the creation of a new data set, using paid actors to create deepfake videos.
* Some suggest deepfake videos aren't all bad. Constine suggested that deepfakes are all part of the growth in personalized media. Deepfakes may simply represent the next era in user-generated content and a modern take on the selfie.

===

* Ultimately, brands can achieve the most by inclluding paid and earned media in their social media marketing efforts. Paid and earned media support each other and drive traffic to owned media. Figure 6.8 illustrates how paid and earned media work together in social media to promote brand messages. Recent research emphasizes the importance of brand participation in social communities as brands manage the interactions from multiple sources of brand information available to consumers. Google's ZMOT (Zero Moment of Truth) studies confirm that people may be exposed to numerous sources of information but also include information from word-of-mouth communication in social communities and news media. Advertising was once one-to-may, but targeting and digital media make it possible for advertising to commnicate one-to-one. At the same time, word-of-mouth has shifted from one-to-one communication to one-to-many, via social media. The interactivity and interdependence of information sources result in an **echoverse**, defined as "the entire communications environment in which a brand/firm operates, with actors contributing and being influenced by each other's actions". Feedback loops exist between all of the stakeholders in the brand's environment. As brands operate in teh echoverse, they should utilize personalized social media communication to brand fans and customers.

## IS THE BRAN READY FOR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP?
* Clearly, there is a lot to be gained for brands operating in social media, and from friending customers in social networks.
* Managers should ask these questions before deciding whether social relationships will work for a specific brand:

* Is the brand set up for engagement? Mark Kingdon, CEO of Organic, Inc., a digital marketing agency, said that "Brands have to allow for and anticipate dialogue, because consumers very much want to engage with brands and not all brands are set up for engagement. A lot of brands are simply set up to broadcast their message to an audience" Some brands will be safer with one-way communication.
* If the traditional brand participates in social media, where should the brand be? Should the brand have its own dedicated social network space (e.g., Nike Joga)? Or will the brand have the best chance of creating consumer dialogue and engagement by using an existing network such as Gather or Facebook? Is there a social network site that is well suited to the brand? For example, Purina is perfectly suited to advertising on Dogster, but its message may not be as effective on Glue.
* How can the brand's profiles be developed in such a way as to reflect the brand's personality? With what voice will the brand speak? How will the brand interact within the site?
* If "fan pages" exist among brand loyalists on social network sites, how can the brand leverage the fan sites to better meet its objectives?
* How can the brand integrate its social network presence into other campaign components? Integration may start with simple steps, such as including a Facebook icon in otehr brand messages and develop into utilizing the social network for sales promotions such as coupon distribution and contest administration.

### CASE STUDY
221BC EMBRACE FRIENDVERTISING
* 221BC is most active in the zone of social community. It maintains a profile and active persona in Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Figure 6.9 illustrates 221BC's Facebook profile.
* Its social media profiles reflect the corporate brand and use the 221BC brand logo. Its brand value is primarily that of balance. 221BC balances the authentic health benefits of traditional pungent kombucha with a modern knowledge of herbs and superfoods to create an appealing flavor and pleasurable berage experience. Traditional fermentation. Only whole ingredients and superfoods--no probiotics added. No supplements added. No extracts. No juices from concentrate. No sugar subsitutes. 221BC is REAL FOOD, not a supplment. This is the way 221BC is presented in its social media messaging. The brand emphasizes that wellness is a result of consuming real food and wellness can begin with the simply choice to consume 221BC kombucha. The brand personality is that of "Bubbly Buddha".
* A positive for 221BC is the engagement of Aneta Lundquist as its founder. The brand is also represented by Aneta Lundquist's personal profiles. She is in some ways the face of 221BC, much as GT's Living Foods is complemented by GT Dave's personal profiles. Sprout Social points out that 70% of people feel more connected to a brand when its CEO is active on social media.
* 221BC focuses on informative content and strives to create magnet posts to attract engagement. 
* most of 221BC's posts currently feature the product itself, which is a form of megaphone broadcasting and consistent with the informing tactic discussed in Chapter 5. 
* There is room for 221BC to build a fan base. 221BC currently engages with fans by reposting UGC, like the example shown in Figure 6.13. Primarily, 221BC seeks to develop a sense of emotional engagement with fans by replying to fan posts and reposting fan content.
* The company also highlights cultural competence for its community by posting videos and Instagram Stories of the production line at 221BC's manufacturing plant. Howver, fan development should be a focus, because its target audience is currently more of a fan of kombucha and the related lifestyle than it is a fan of 221BC brand..
* This should also help 221BC compete against GT's Living Foods, because GT's uses UGC in multiple ways. For instance, it invites people to submit inspiring quotes on social media, which may be selected to appear on its bottles. 221BC has created a contest but it may want to tie future contests to incentivized UGC.
* In addition to engaging in fan conversations, 221BC also takes advantage of real-time marketing. For instance, during the flu season, the brand emphasized the viral-fighting benefits of its ginger flavor of kombucha.
* 221BC is increasing its paid media spend on social media. In the past, it has done so by boosting posts on Instagram and using paid ads on Facebook with a "Learn More" call to action. Paid social ads on Instagram and Facebook can help to achieve greater reach and frequency and help to grow 221BC's audience.
* Currently, the number of followers on the brand's Facebook and Instagram profiles is quite small compared to that of GT's Living Foods. That limits the brand's organic reach, so paid social ads will be a valuable addition. These ads can be targeted at custom audiences or lookalike audiences using the brand's target audience demographics and psychographics.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
1. Is a corporate brand presence the right one for 221BC? How could the personality of the Bubbly Buddha be better reflected in the brand's social profiles.
2. How could 221BC grow its audience through conversation and other social community tactics?
3. Is what ways can 221BC grow its brand community and inspire brand fans to self-identify, and participate in auxiliary consumption and production? 
4. Should 221BC engage in conversations with GT's Living Foods? How could banter with its competitors facilitate its marketing objectives?
5. Using the elements of ad design described in the chapter, create a sample Facebook ad for 221BC. What call-to-action do you recommend?

## THE SOCIAL PUBLISHING ZONE
* In this chapter, our focus shifts to the second zone of social media, as shown in Figure 7.1. **Social publishing** is the production and issuance of content for distribution via social publishing sites. **Content** is the unit of avlue in a social community, akin to the dollar in our economy. It provides a social object for community participation. Social publishing sites aid in the dissemination of content to an audience by providing a digital location for content while also enabling audience participation and sharing. Social publishing empowered content creators to expose their creative works (user-generated content) to the world and build an audience without the barriers present in traditional publishing models. As social media have evolved, so too has the social publishing ecosystem. Individual users range from amateur to professional. Traditional media organizations like magazines and newspapers use social publishing to promote their products and drive traffic to their owned media sites. Organizations use social publishing to disseminate information to their stakeholders. And, of course, social publishing is an essential distribution channel in brand content efforts. Brands value social publishing for its ability to communicate a variety of information, reach and attract audiences, reach an extended audience through peer-to-peer sharing, capture audience feedback, identify prospective customers, and support other marketing efforts including search engine optimization.
* The channels of social publishing include blogs, media-sharing sites, social network sites, and social bookmarketing and news sites. Blogs are websites that host regularly updated content. Media-sharing sites include video-sharing sites such as Youtube, Vimeo, and Ustream; photo-sharing sites such as Flickr and Instagram; audio sharing sites such as Podcast Alley; and document- and presentation-sharing sites such as Scribd and SlideShare. Increasingly, social sites enable multi-media, for example, Snapchat users can snap photos and video. You can see that some of the vehicles used for social publishing are social network sites that facilitate relationships in the zone of social community. This is particularly true for Facebook, which, not the defining element of social publishing; rather it is the sharing of knowledge via content in an environment that also enables discourse and other forms of particiupation.
* In this chapter, you'll learn some basic principles of content creation and distribution; how marketers can design content for search engine and social media optimization; and how to promote social content using social media press releases, microblogs, and social news and bookmarking sites.

## PUBLISHING CONTENT
* Content marketing has evolved as a core  aspect of marketing communication. According to the Content Marketing Institute, **content marketing** is a "strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience--and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. The philosophy of content marketing emphasizes that brands should publish high-value content that pulls the audience in. The content may be published in owned, paid, or social media channels, but regardless, social media should be used to activate the content and drive audience engagement, conversation, and amplification through sharing.

## TYPES OF CONTENT
* The types of content published online, and shared via social media, include an enormous range of material. Some examples include **research, instructions, opinions, essays, poetry, fiction, information, fashion photos, advice, art, or photos from that wild party last week**. It may be curated or original. Social media content may begin with content published for some other purpose, such as a broadcast commercial, entertainment film, or news story that is repurposed for social publishing. Or the content may be entirely original contributions that community members produce and publish. Ideally, social media content should do more than repurpose offline content for digital display, although we often do find this kind of "secondhand content" on some sites. Note that we distinguish the meaning of content for social publication fro mthat of content shared in the zone of social community, such as comment,s photos, announcements, and other conversational posts shared in social communities.
* Content appears in a variety of different formats, including blog posts, feature articles, white papers, case studies, videos, and more. According to MediaKix, five of the most effective content formats include an Instagram post, an Instagram story, a Youtube video, an Instagram video, and a blog post.
* Content can be any of these and more. Developments in technology are enhancing existing forms of content and creating new ones. For instance, virtual reality applications have resulted in "immersive video" also known as 360-degree video. Of the many forms of virtual reality, immersive video is one of the easiest and least expensive to produce, distribute, and experience. Already, the New York Times, The Economist, National Geographic, and other publisher have incorpoate virtual reality into the content they are publishing for social media.
* Content is increasingly multi-layered; it offers several iterations and/or applications based on the primary piece. For instance, suppose Travel & Leisure magazine publishes an article on fashionable solutions to travel clothing dilemmas. The online magazine site also publishes the article, but now it includes several social features, including a 360-degree video, a comment option, a Share This Widget, a bookmarking option, and a game called Pack and Play. The content began its life as a piece of content in the traditional press. It was repurposed for use in the online magazine. But it didn't become social until the content was fortified with interactivity, participation, and shareability. Note too that the social components of the content added value to everyone connected to the content. Th original publisher gained additional readers through the sharing option and enhanced the stickiness of the site (making the site more attractive to online advertisers) because it offered social features. The readers were able to better use the information in the article because they could share it, store it for later reference, and practice the tips offered in the Pack and Play game application.
* Table 7.1 provides a break down on the most popular types of content brands use for social publishing, along with key information on the best channels to use, the difficulty level to create, or the cost to outsource production.

## CHANNEL OF CONTENT DISTRIBUTION
* Content needs an audience. To reach an audience, publishers need a distribution channel strategy. Where will the content be published. Not only will the content live in this digital location, social media promotion of the content will drive people to its venue. Here we review the typical types of channels chosen. Keep in mind that different forms of content lend themselves to specific channels.

### BLOGS
* Blogs began (in 1994!) as simple online logs posted in reverse chronological order, and developed into a widely used publishing venue for individual and corporate use. With hundreds of millions of blogs in existence, blogging is clearly a publishing venue here to stay. However, blogggin has evolved: once a way to simply share opinions, activities, and experience via text posting, today may blogs include information of all kinds of expressed with multi-media. When video is prevalent, they are known as vlogs. Blogs are primarily owned media. The blogger controls the website and the blog's content. However, some social media vehicles enable a form of blogging that does not fall into the owned media category. For instance, Tumblr enables blogging within the Tumblr social network. Bloggers may be hobbyists, part-timers, corporate bloggers, or self-employed bloggers. Many of the influencers with celebrity status are bloggers. To learn more about the history of blogging, read the blog post, "A brief timeline of the history of blogging" by HubSpot, a company specializing in inbound marketing and sales software.
* Blogs offer an opportunity for individuals to express their opinions, share their expertise, make money by selling on-site advertising, and attract clients for consulting work. They also offer opportunities for organizations to establish thought leadership on a topic, increase traffic to targeted websites such as an organization's e-commerce site, build links to other corporate sites, drive lead generation, and build brand awareness. For example, Heather Armstrong's blog, Dooce, established her as a creative writer capable of providing her readers with amusement and insight into the life of a typical woman. David Armano's Logic + Emotion blog grew his reputation as a visual thinker and experience designer. Blogging may be an outlet for creative expression but can also be a business! As influencers, the top bloggers in the world earn hundreds of thousands of dollars each month from on-site advertising, affiliate marketing, and brand sponsorships and endorsements. In fact, one of the best sources of information on social media marketing strategies, Mashable, is a blog. Its founder, Pete Cashmore, is among the top-earning bloggers in the world with revenues estimated at more than $40 million annually. The blog began in Cashmore's bedroom in Scotland when he was just 19. Another favorite blog is Dogshaming. This popular blog pulishes images of dogs who have misbehaved. The images are submitted by its readers and are examples of user-generated content.

### MEDIA-SHARING SITES
* Like blogs, media-sharing sites enable individuals and organizations to publish content online. However, whereas blogs are typically in the realm of owned media, media-sharing sites are shared and earned media because their environments are not directly controlled by the person or organization posting the content. Instagram, Pinterest, and Youtube are all media-sharing sites. Often, the choice of which media-sharing site to use is dictated by the type of content to be distributed. The style of content should be customized for t he site's personality. Some media-sharing vehicles are serious, others quirky. Creators are earning incomes through social publishing on media-sharing sites. According to one study, nearly 17 million Americans earned an estimated $6.8 billion media-sharing their creative content across nine channels.

### EXHIBIT 7.1
FORD SOCIAL CONNECT ITS SOCIAL PUBLISHING CHANNELS
* Ford maintains a corporate hub for its social media content, called Ford Social, but video content is shared on its Youtube channel, photos are shared on its Flickr photostream and on Instgram, fact sheets and other corporate content are shared on Scribd, and news is shared on its Twitter feed. Reviews, covered in Chapter 9, are also a form of content that can be published using media-sharing sites. Media-sharing sites like Pinterest and Instagram may be used to drive sales as well as customer engagement.

## CONTENT PRODUCER: WHAT IS "AUTHENTIC"?
* Content can take so many forms that it's sometimes difficult to categorize. This is especially true in the online world, where the lines between what is real and what is not become increasingly blurred. For example, poople often share Youtube clips of outragoues or racy commercials with their friends--but in many cases these spots were not produced by the company. In fact, the proliferation of untruths and exaggerations (or so-called **urban legends**) is so widespread that specialized websites do nothing but verify or refute them. The website Snopes.come is the best known of these.
* This ambiguity also exists when we try to identify the sources or distributors of content. At one time, it was easy to classify a message as eitehr journalistic, editorial, or commercial. A journalistic messge reports on facts in an objective and unbiased fashion. In an **editorial message**, the source expresses an opinion or interpretation along with the factual information. The most obvious example is the editorial page of a newspaper, where a writer presents an argument that may criticze a government, a company, or a politician. This section of the paper is clearly marked as editorial. In contrast, a **commercial message8** such as advertisement makes it clear that the intent is to persuade the reader or viewer t ochange an attitude or behaviour; the source has paid a fee to place the message in a medium. So, it's obvious in a traditional newspaper that a half-page plea, say, to pass environmental legislation or carry our sanctions against governments that permit whaling, is sponsored and paid for by an identifiable organization.
* For news and educational ontent, traditional press organizations hire journalists to research, verify, and write credible, objective, trustworthy stories. These media outlets then deliver that content to a paying audience via newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and radio and television programs. The traditional rpess controls the message and the channel, but it adheres to accepted industry guidelines and norms. Similarly, traditional entertainment companies or production houses create and distribute their own content. Broadcast networks commission the development of programs and movies they show on the stations they own. And the transition from editorial to commercial content is clear with broadcast announcements like "And now a word from our sponsors", or labeling content as "advetorial".
* Increasingly these lines are blurring and, as a result, the authenticity and trustworthiness of messages published and shared thorugh social media (and, for that matter, other forms of media as well) may not be clear to consumers. For instance, journalism today includes both the objective storytelling of the results of investigative reporting as well as the subjective storytelling of interpretive journalism. **Intepretive journalism** blurs the line between editorial messages and journalism in t hat it goes beyond the basic facts of an event or topic to provide context, analysis, and possible consequences. The development of native advertising, which we introduced in Chapter 6, blurs the line between organic posts and paid posts in social media.
* Though content from traditional media sources is still valuable, today these sources struggle as consumers increasingly turn to other places to access their news and entertainment. People no long need to subscribe to the local newspaper in order to get credible news. Instead they can read email, Twitter posts, blogs, and updates to social network sites, all from their smartphones. Some estimates suggest that more than 50% of adults get their news from socia media. This seismic shift has forced the closing of media providers around the world as they fail to find new ways to monetize their businesses. Major newspapers such as the San Francisco Chronicle have closed, while other traditional media vehciels merge with online companies--for example, the venerable print magazine newsweek was acquired by The Daily Beast. Other traditional content providers adapt to the new media environment as they shift from devliering their messages on a printed page (or, as some new media people like to say, "dead trees") to mobile applications. Gourmet responded by evolving into the first mobile magazine. It closed operations due to declining subscriptions and ad revenues. Gourmet Live instead delivers articles to foodies on their mobile phones. But, unlike the old dead tree delivery system, this content is also social--subscribers can interat, share, and play games within the application.
* In addition to a blurring of the lines between editorial and commercial messages, today we witness an explosion of user-generated content--which, as we've seen, is the lifeblood of emerging social media. In many cases, everyday people create and post this content for personal reasons rather than to receive financial reward. A proud father shoots a video of his son's high school graduation and shares it with the family. An expecting young mother chronicles the story of her pregnancy and birth. A retired couple keeps a photo log of their yearly trips where they explore the world together.
* What's new about this consumer-generated content? In one sense, absolutely nothing. People throughout history have written stories, commissioned portraits, kept diaries, and more recently taken photos and videos of family events. What is new is that due to the Social media Value Chain, people can share this content with those beyond their immediate area. Today they post photos to Flickr or perhaps a less-than-flattering video from last night's raucous party on TikTok. This content is largely shared in the context of social communities, but it is also published content, crossing into the realm of zone 2.
* In terms of the content itself, UGC is perceived as authentic because it is assumed to represent the views of the creator. This is in part why influencer content is perceived as so valuable. The subject matter of UGC may be virtually anything, including content related to brands. Brands and consumers can benefit from UGC; it may facilitate awareness, desire, and the choice to purchase or not. You may stumble upon this content while you search for specific information about a product or brand, discovering it accidentally. And, because of the power of social media, these inputs may well impact what others think or even change a firm's marketing activities. In the form of **cultural co-creation**, co-created meanings (among both producers and consumers) fold back into the culture. In fact, it is the influence of UGC on brand image that has led marketers to conclude that brand meaning is now co-created--whether brands like it or not! Some brands have mebraced co-creation, finding ways to involve consumers. The prevalence of "share your story" campaigns are a manifestation of brand co-creation.

## INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC MOTIVES AND CONTENT AUTHENTICITY
* It's useful to distinguish between UGC that people voluntarily publish and content that appears because some organization has invited contributions from users. **Organic content** is content that a person feels intrinsically motivated to prepare and share. People tend to view organic content as authentic and trustworthy. In the early days of social media, most content was organic content contributed by regaulr people (users). Just as crowdsourcing has been used to accomplish challenging tasks, brands can benefit from crowdsourced content. **Consumer-solicited content (CSC)** refers to invited by non-compensated **citizen advertising**, which is another way to describe marketing messages that actual consumers create. Sometimes marketers call this approach participatory advertising; brands invite submissions, set mandatory guidelines and of the brand in use or logos and former commercials. **Incentivized content** is encouraged by the offer of an incentive, such as the chance to win a contest, receive free merchandise, or even earn cold hard cash. In these cases the contribution is a response to a call to action. You've observed a similar technique in TV informercials, where a host reminds you to "Call right now. Operators are standing by!" That's a call to action. In social media marketing, calls to action ensure that people participate in the social campaign. Perhaps the most famous example is the Crash the Super Bowl contest sponsored by Doritos and Pepsi, which gave citizen advertisers the chance to win $1 million and see their ad on air. One winner, called "Time Machine", cost just $300 to make. The approach paid off for Doritos in terms of ad effectiveness, with user submissions landing among the top ten ads shown for memorability and likeability. That's pretty impressive when you remember that the Doritos spots were "homemade" and cost so little to create.
* **Sponsored content** refers to paid content. People are paid for their content creations, and brands may actively seek out influencers like bloggers, videographers, and artists to participate in the campaign. For example, the company PayPerPost pays bloggers to endorse products. Sponsored bloggers are known as **spokebloggers** These bloggers may also participate in other paid forms of endorsement, like attending or hosting events. This is particularly common in the fashion industry where bloggers like Aimee Song (of the blog, Song of Style) command a great deal of respect for the influence they have with their readers. Because our cultural expecatation for blogs (and other forms of content in the social media space) is that they represent indepedendent, non-funded, non-commercial content, the FTC introduced specific guidelines for social media content producers. The intent of the guidelines is to protect the public from adveritising disguised as social media by ensuring that sponsorships are transparent. This is the subject of this chapter's critical reflection feature.
* Counterfeit conversations occur when an organization plants content that masquerades as original material an acutal consumer posted. This is related to the risk surrounding the development of "deepfakes", which we covered in Chapter 6. For example, Chick-Fil-A alledgedly created a puppet account on Facebook after people flocked to its real Facebook page to complain. In response, a girl named "Abby Farle" went to Facebook to respond the complaints with a counterargument--one that favored Chick-Fil-A. Farle was outed as a fake after someone noticed Farle's profile picture was a stock photo. Such hoaxes may be user generated too. After Target announced its children's clothing would be gender neutral, critics took to Facebook to complain. Facebook user Mike Melgaard cam to Target's defense. He created a fake Facebook account and posed as a Target customer service rep--under the name AskForHelp, with a bull-eye profile pic--and began excoriating the haters with comically sarcastic relies. He got away with it for about 16 hours, too, commenting on about 50 posts before the fake account was shut down. An on top of all this, **brand fraud**, scams by brand impersonators, is a growing problem, both for the brands whose reputations are harmed and for the consumers who are at risk of being victims of scams.

## DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE BRANDED CONTENT
* According to the Content Marketing Institute, 89% of B2B brands and 83% of B2C brands use social publishing and content marketing. Branded content enables organization to develop a strategic, well-designed message and distribute the message through social channels, resulting in additional reach, engagement, and earned media in the form of word-of-mouth communication and buzz. To be effective, brands must develop content that is aligned with their strategy and brand image, and valuable to the target audience. Table 7.2 highlights the marketing objectives B2B and B2C marketers seek to accomplish using social publishing. Table 7.3 identifies the most important types of content used by B2B and B2C marketers.

                Table 72. Marketing Objectives Pursued Using Social Publishing by B2B and B2C Marketers

                MARKETING OBJECTIVE | B2B | B2C

                Brand wareness | 86% | 84%
                Lead generation | 70% | 61%
                Customer retention/loyalty | 63% | 55%
                Sales | 53% | 48%
                Building an audience via subscription growth | 45% | 38%
                Lead nurturing | 68% | 49%
                Educate audiences | 79% | 75%
                Build credibility/trust | 75% | 65%

                Videos | 71% | 66%

=== 

* As in any other media, not all content is created equal. Some is trash; some is important. Some content is fun, some inspiring, and some just titillating (anyone for "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"). As Figure 7.2 shows, we can characterize content in terms of its originality and substance according to a **content value ladder**. Let's take a closer look at this form of classification:

                Flagship
                Pillar
                Authority-building
                Basic --Original content
                Filler -- Content repurposed from other sources, news, announcements and commentary

                PS: Hight to low about value of content

                from authority-building to up is contribution of original content

===

* At the lowest step in the ladder we find the least important type of materials. **Filter content** is simply content repurposed from other sources. A site called ArticlesBase.com is a free online article directory. It hosts articles that have been contributed by authors hoping to expand the reach of their work online. Others can use the articles posted on ArticleBase at no charge. They just search for the topic of interest, copy and paste the article to their own site, and cite the contributing author. Filler content can also come from other content providers (blogs and posts on media-sharing sites) and syndicated sources such as PRNewsWire and Associated Press.
* All other content on the ladder is **original content**. The first level of original content refers to contributions that originate with the poster but are not "weighty" enough to establish the creator as an authority in the topic area or serve as a refernce piece for the audience.
* If that original content positions the sponsoring entity as an authoirty on the subject in question, then we call it **authority-building content**. Brands publish backlink-building content to establish and maintain their reputations as experts and thought leaders in their industries
* If a source creates a solid foundation of original content, the foundation blocks are known as **pillar content**. Typically pillar content is made up of **content that continues to attract viewers over time**. The content's impact grows exponentially over time as other people share it through reposting, citations, and retweets. For this reason, these posts are called **compounding posts**.        
* **Flagship content** is original, authority-building, pillar content that becomes a seminal work in the field. It may be ground-breaking or pioneering work that helps to define a phenomenon or shape the way people think about something for a long time. Those pieces of content create a draw for years to come. Flagship content is also called **evergreen content**.

* In Chapter 5, we talked about the value of developing a content mix that includes hygiene, hub, and hero content. This is similar to the content value ladder in that it recognizes that brands must offer some high-value content to develop an audience, but **it's unrealistic to develop only high-value content. Doing so would likely result in insufficient content for maintaining a consistent publishing cadence.** That said, developing high-value, original content pays off. HubSpot Research analyzed thousands of blog posts from more than 15,000 companies. The results showed that only one in ten posts are compounding posts, but those posts accounted for 38% of the blog traffic across the sample. The remaining posts are decaying posts; they deliver a surge of traffic, but then decay over time. The takeaway? **One compounding post is worth more than six decaying posts for driving traffic, generating leads, and influencing sales.**
* What are the characteristics of high-value content? The answer will depend upon the industry and target audience, but there are some common characteristics to consider. Part of the equation is based on the quality of the ingredients used; part is tied to the popularity of certain types of content and content traits. Table 7.4 highlights five popular types of content. Each type addresses an audience need and presents the information in a usable format. Through how-to and list content tend to be popular regardless of the social media vehicle, keep in mind that content should be appropriate for the channel of communication. **The style, tone, length, use of multi-media, and descriptive hashtags could all vary for content published on Instagram versus on a brand blog. Brands can create variations of a single piece of content to address channel characteristics. This can help to increase share of voice and exposure to the target audience.**
* Content can also categorized according to functional orientation (abstract or tactical), topic breadth (broad or narrow), and topic temporality (evergreen or terminable). Broad topics are of interest to a large audience. Tactical content helps the viewer by explaining important information, providing instructions, or giving advice. Evergreen content has a long expiration date. In contrast, general content may be interesting and relevant but can't cut through the clutter as well as content that solves a problem for the audience. Narrow topics are of interest to niche audiences; the relatively smaller size of the audience equates to fewer content views, "likes" and shares. Terminable posts are time-sensitive. In other words, they have an expiration date, after which the content isn't relevant. The content may be related to current events (a technique known as "newsjacking") or announcements about limited-time offers. Terminable posts serve as filler content or original (but low value) content. HubSpot's study of posts found that most compounding posts were broad, tactical, and evergreen.

                TABLE 7.4 Types of Pillar Content
                TYPE | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE

                * "How-to" Article: This form of content is the most popular type posted, according to an analysis of content shared on several news sites, including Digg and StumbleUpon.: How to Make Brownies in a Crockpot

                * Definition Article: This type of post defines a concept. Although this is a straightforward approach, it provides a high level of utility for those interested in the concept being defined.: What is Web 2.0?

                * Glossary Article: This form of article includes a series of definitions related to each other and creates a resource guide on the topic: A Glossary of Literary Terms

                * Theory Article: Theory articles offer some unique insight into a topic but the content is opinion. They are equivalent to opinion-editorial pieces in your local newspaper: Media Aren't Social

                * List Article: These forms of content use bullets for easy readability and consumption. They may draw on humor or education in detailing the list.: Top 10 USB Thumbdrive Tricks

* These principles hold true whether the content is original, branded content, sponsored content (such as when a brand sponsors an influencer to focus on the brand in his or her content), or brand-related UGC. For marketers, content should be of value to the target audience. The content will then be sought after and shared. Let's look at some examples of how brands have successfully launched social publishing strategies.
* Velocity Partners used social publishing to reach its clients. A B2B marketing agency based in the UK, Velocity Partners wanted a way to emphasize its culture to prospective clients. The traits it values in customer relationships became the basis for an e-book, The B2B Marketing Manifesto, which it published on its website. The e-book can be downloaded (once prospects enter basic contact information, which feeds Velocity's lead generation funnel), comments are enabled on the site, and the link can be shared using Twitter, Facebook, and other social sites. Indium Corporation provides materials used to produce electronics. Are you thinking, how could a company like that use social publishing? Well, it did! It created a blog called **From One Engineer to Another**, which provided guidance and training to its target audience. The fashion company French Connection wanted a way to provide advice to its target audience the way a personal shopper would. It built a Youtube channel called YouTique that provides short videos on fashion advice. Lauren Luke started out as a part-time cosmetics salesperson in Newcastle, England. She developed a Youtube channel with instructional videos to help her sell mroe products. The videos have millions of views and catapulted Luke to a thought leader in the cosmetics industry. Just five years later, she has her own brand of makeup and a series of books.
* Are you seeing a pattern here? Whether the marketing is B2B or B2C, the content adds values. It's relevant. It's not about selling. It's about providing something that people can participate in and share that experience with others. The core of the content may be published in owned media and made shareable, or it may be published in a media-sharing site, or it may have elements of both. But the content is engaging and relevant. It is content people want to share because it's just that good.
* This brings us to a final point on creating high-value content for social publishing. Remember that we want the content to be viewed, but we also want it to stimulate the audience to participate and to share the content with their own social network. When creating content, ask whether what you've created is interesting enough to trigger participation and sharing.

## DISTRIBUTING AND PROMOTING CONTENT
* High value content can't meet marketing objectives unless it reaches the target audience. This means that rather than rely solely on search engines and a handful of fans to drive organic reach, social publishers need to distribute and promote the content. **According to research from the Content Marketing Institute, marketers use an average of six social media channels to distribute content.** Most marketers also use paid advertising on social network sites to get the word out to the target audience. To optimize impressions, content should be both published and promoted. Table 7.5 highlights the different distribution channels used by marketers. Table 7.6 reveals the different ways marketers promtoe content.

* For marketers there is a twofold goal for social publishing: **1) to increase exposure to the brand's messages, and 2) to use the content to drive traffic to the brand's owned media.** The social publishing process is similar to the media planning process we see for traditional advertising campaigns. In those cases, the **media plan** designates how the campaign's creative content will be disseminated to the target audience using specific media vehicles such as radio or billboards. The media planner sets specific goals for what is to be accomplished through the ad placements in terms of audience reach, exposure to the message, and desired outcomes. Social publishing works much the same way except the creative content seeking exposure is not necessarily an ad (in the traditional static or rich media formats) and the distribution fo that content  is accomplished with inbound links or link chains to the content from search engine results, other websites, and social media communities. In other words, traditional media plans utilize paid media to achieve marketing objectives. Social publishing relies upon owned media and earned media online to reach these goals.
* Just as traditional media plans vary considerably in terms of comlexity and sophistication, so too do social publishing strategies. Marketers must determine what content to publish and where and then develop a strategy to maximize exposure to the content through search engine rankings and social sharing. In fact, we can identify two types of optimization that an organization can use (either individually or in combination) with on-site and off-site optimization tactics. Table 7.7 summarizes these levels.
* Using **search engine optmization (SEO)**, the process of modifying content, site characteristics, and content connections to achieve improved search engine rankings, marketers develop and publish content in ways that improve the likelihood that search engines will rank the sites well in response to search queries. Whereas SEO is all about increasing the prominence of a site on search lists using on-site and off-site tactics, **social media optmization (SMO)** is a process that makes it more likely for content on a specific social media platform to be more visible and linkable in online communities. If the content is valuable and engaging, other sites will link to it. And people will share it, post it, rank it, tag it, and augment it with their own stories about your brand.
* All of this linking activity in turn increass the credibility of the marketer's message--exactly the goal of social publishing. SMO not only provides additional visibility for a marketer's message, it benefits search rankings because it increases the likelihood that others will link to it. Thus, SEO focuses on earning higher organic search rankings whereas SMO focuses on earning organic links to content. SMO is used by search engine optimizers because those links also improve rankings. The optimization process is so important that it has created an entirely new field of specialists who help organizations to stay afloat in the growing sea of content. Let's take a closer look at each level of social publishin.

                TABLE 7.7. Media Optimiation Matrix
                Type of Optimization: Search Engine Optimization
                Onsite: Optimizing content value, tags, keywords, titles, URL
                Offsite: Publishing related content elsewhere with links to original; creating a linkwheel structure

                Type of Optimization: Social Media Optimization
                Onsite: Including share tools and RSS feed options
                Offsite: Promoting on social news and social bookmarking sites; microblogging content headline and link; promoting social media press releases

### LEVEL 1: SOCIAL PUBLISHING AND SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
* The first level focuses on ways the brand can increase exposure to its online content and drive site traffic by publishing related components of the content across several social sites. These placements include link back to the targeted site. This cross-promotion to the branded content is accomplished with owned media and the placement of related content on media-sharing sites (earned media).
* How can a business use different elements of social publishing to multiply its exposure in an inexpensive way? let's consider the fictive brand SOS (SellOurStuff). SellOurStuff is an eBay reseller of luxury goods. As a promotional tool, SOS might create a branded article, an article that is written to promote SOS's expertise in the field, on "7 Ways to Spot Luxury that (re)sells". The article is promotionale piece that educates the company's prospects on the types of items SOS could auction successfully while it encourages them to retain SOS as their auctioner.
* The article is a good piece of content--but it won't help SOS unless prospects are exposed to it. SOS publishes the piece on its main website at SOS-SellOurStuff.com, and the company also posts a teaser to the article and posts them to Flikr (again with a link to the original) and also creates a Prezi slideshow of the content to share at the Prezi site (with again, you guessed it, a link back to the original). Finally, SOS creates a badge that its top clients can post on their own personal webpages to show visitors that they have an "Eye for Luxury". That is, SOS designates these top clients as people who already know the rules for spotting luxury that resells. The SOS badge also links back to the branded content on the SOS website. In this example, SOS created content that promotes its brand message. If then shared the content on its own site and on other sites where it had some control as to what was presented and how it linked back to the branded content. **Publishing in multiple places creates additional "opportunitites to see" (OTS) for the targeted audience and brand-controlled links to the targeted site.**
* At this point, the brand can utilize search engine optimization to improve how its content is listed in response to search queries. These listings are crucial--as you probably know from experience, most people tend to follow up only on the first few results they get from a query. SWO is a complicated technical process, and it's also a bit of a cat-and-mouse game. For example, #1 site Google uses a secret algorithm to decide which sites will appear at the top of a search list. The company changes this formula on a regular basis, so SEO experts engage in a constant contest to figure out the algorithm and then modify their sites to keep up with Google's changes.
* Consumers lvoe their search engines. The ranking these search engines generate are crucial because they drive site traffic--and of course traffic is social media's lifeblood. No traffic, no interest. No interest, eventually no site. Sites that attract heavy traffic are valuable for two reasons:

1. **A large number of visitors makes it more likely the sponsor will benefit from a higher rate of conversion (i.e., the person browsing actually purchases, so he or she is converted from a browser to a buyer)**
2. **The more "eyeballs" the site attracts, the more advertising revenue the site can generate (assuming it sells ad space to other advertisers)**

* SEO is the key tool used for **search engine marketing (SEM)**, a form of online marketing that promotes websites by increasing the visibility of the site's URL in search engine results, both organic and sponsored. Incidentally, there are hundreds of search engines, and some sites that do not feature search as their primary function also offer search engine capabilities. Youtube and Facebook, for instance, are also used for search.
* When someone enters a query, called a **SERP** (Search Engine Results Page), the search engine turns to its index for the best matches and then returns a search results list to the user. The results list includes the organic results, which are listings ranked in order of relevance based on the search engine's ranking algorithm, and the sponsored results, which are paid advertising links.

##### HOW DO PEOPLE USE SEARCH RESULTS?
Let's say you've dreamed of owning a high-end designer handbag--the Hermes Birkin. Celebrities and fashionstas carry it, it's always in scarce supply, and a new one can set you back a year's tuition. A brand new Birkin is out--to expensive--but maybe you can find a used one online. You might visit Yahoo! and enter the search query, "Hermes handbags". The search results list leads off with **sponsored**, or paid, links. In this case, e-retailers such as DesignerPurseOutlets.com and Bluefly.com have paid for sponsored listings. The search results then provide a series of **organic** listings for Hermes as well as e-retailers such as eBay and The Purse Blog. These sites did not pay to be listed; they are based on the search engine's model for delivering relevant search results. However, in addition to these retailers you may see several merchants that offer counterfeit versions of the bag. Why? Those siteswere listed in part because Google's algorithm indicated that the content was a good match to your search query. you might now refine your search, but if it turns out you'd consider a Birkin replica, you might click through to one of the listed sites (and possibly make a purchase, or at a minimum build the site's traffic figures, which will help it earn ad revenue).
* As you can imagine, it's very important for a brand or site to appear in a serach list so that the shopper will at least consider clicking on the link. Although search engine marketers can buy paid listings from search engines, it's preferable to earn organic results. One reason is that these results have no **pay-per-click** fees. These are the fees a marketer pays when someone clicks on an online display ad. Organic results also tend to generate more site traffic, presumably because people view them as more credible referals from the search engine.
* Organic entries, especially the first few, garner most of the attention in a typical search. Clickthroughs taper off pretty rapidly, so few people tend to go beyond the first ten or so. Of course, pages and pages of search results could be returned for any given search--but again, for the most part these won't generate much traffic. For example, the search on Hermes handbags returned a whopping 1,900,000 listings.
* We know that people tend to look at the first searches in a list rather than the entire list (few of us would make it to listing number 1,900,000 no matter how badly we wanted that Birkin bag). Still, it's helpful to understand more about which links the user is likely to follow. Researchers use **eye-tracking studies** to help identify the characteristics of a search page that determine this. They borrow this method from more traditional advertising researchers, who for many years have hooked respondents to sophisticated devices that follow the precise movements of eyeballs as they scan ads on TV or computer screens.
* This method shows clearly that most search engine users view only a very limited number of search results and do so in one of a few viewing patterns. When typical respondents look at a search page, their eyes travel across the top of the search result, return to the left of the screen, and then travel down to the last item shown on the screen without scrolling. On most screens, this means that every user will view the first three search results, but they may or may not scroll down. Search engine marketers call this space on the screen where listings are virtually guaranteed to be viewd the **golden triangle**. So the real value--the sweet spot--is in earning a list rank that is on the first page, and preferably one of the top three listings ranked. This pattern is still prevalent, but more recent eye-tracking studies suggest that people are scanning vertically now as well, creating an elongated "F" pattern. The shifts in viewing patterns are attributed to changes in the layout of SERP pages and viewing SERPS on mobile devices. Of the patterns identified, relevant, organic, top-ranked listings still achieve the highest clickthroughs. How can a source enhance the probability that its listing will appear within one of these viewing patterns? For many organizations, this is (literally) the million dollar question! And that's exactly the point of search engine optimization.

#### HOW SEARCH ENGINES WORK
* Search listings are produced by search engines using indexed data and an algorithm that determines a listing's relevance to the search query. Search engines use **web crawlers** (also known as spiders and bots); these are automated web programs that gather information from sites that ultimately from the serach engine's entries. The programs are called crawlers because they crawl websites. They follow all the links, site after site, collecting data until the link network is exhausted. After the bots gather this information, they index (classify) it using labels the sites provide. The **indexed data** include tags and keywords derived from site content. Then, when someone enters a search query, the search engine applies its algorithm to determine the sites that are most relevant to the search query. This algorithm determines which istes are identified in the search listing and the ranking of the sites presented.

#### ON-SITE OPTIMIZATION
* You can see that optimizing content in order to improve serach engine rankings is an important marketing task. How do marketers optimize? they use one of two key approaches: 1) on-site optimization, or 2) off-site optimization. This is because the bots look for cues on-site, especially tags, and for **off-site indicators** such as links from other sites as they index data.
* On-site, coders try to optimize certain site characteristics (call **on-site indicators**) that the search bots and the search engine index. In plain English, this means they tinker with elements of the site to make indexing more efficient and ensure that the web crawlers will classify the site the way the developers intend. The primary on-site variables are **keywords** embedded in the page's tag, title, URL, and content.
* Keywords tell the bot what information to gather and specify the relevant topic. The bot will collect this informatio nfor the search engine to use in indexing. The keywords explain to the search engine when to deliver your site as a search result. Consequently, choosing the right keywords is critical to ensuring a site shows up in relevant searches. Once you have selected your keywords, you will work them into the areas crawled by the bots--the site's tags, title, URL, and body copy (or content).
* For example say your website sells vintage comic books. To ensure that a buyer who wants to snag a spristine copy of Wonder Woman Issue #5: Battle for Womanhood, published in 1942, will visit your online store, you might code your site with these labels:

* Meta-tag: code embeded in a webpage. Meta-tages are visible to site visitors but only by viewing the source code for the page. Meta-keywords should include three or fur of the targeted keywords. The meta-description should include two or three sentences that summarize the page content. The description is shown with the search engine listing. The vintage comic book store might include meta-tags such as adventure comic, wonder woman, superheroes, and vintage.
* **Title tag**: an HTML tag that defines the page's title. The title is displayed in the browser's title bar, in search engine results, and in RSS feeds. Title tags should include no more than 12 words, with at least two keywords. For example, your website title tags might read: Comic, Direct Sales, Rare Comics, Vintage Comic Books--Vintage Comics offers comic book collectors vintage adventure comics.
* **Heading tag**: an HTML tag that is used to section and describe content. Heading tags should include keywords. Tags for heading levels are designed as H1, H2, H3 and so on. Within the webpage, major headings (named for keywords) will be designated with code such that the sections are recognizable to the bots. For example, the first heading on the page will be desinated as "h1/>That is herading 1 <-h1->" Keywords might include superheroes wonder woman, vintage, comics, dc.
* **Title** your headline-- the main indicator of your page's content. It should be loaded with keywords. Writing optimized titles may seem difficult to some because the style of an optmized title is quite different from that of a story headline a journalist might write. A traditional headline may be indirect; the idea behind a traditional headline is to engage the audience without giving away the story. For instance, a print magazine article about vintage comic books and the prevalence of high-quality replicas might be titled "Vintage Comic Replicas Indistinguishable from the Real Thing". An optimized title might read "Shop Wise: 5 Tips for Ensuring that Vintage Collectible Is Real, Not Fake, Comics" to ensure that the search would index on keywords. Another difference is that the title needs to be more literal than the one we might use in an article: bots are pretty smart, but they don't understand metaphors on puns. "Cute" titles such as "You Can Experience the Adventure of Wonder Woman" or "Counterfeit Comic Books Frustrate Law-Abiding Super Heros" just won't cut it.
* **URL**: the website address. Tot optimize the URL, use a static URL and include the title of the article or the keywords in the URL. **Static URL** do not change and they do not include variable scripts. **Dynamic URL** are generated from scripts and change over time, making it difficult for people to return to your content later. Ideally, you'll have a story or topic in mind around when you device the content. For example, SOS's owner knew that a story explaining how to determine which luxury items will sell and which will bomb would have high value to eBay hobbyists. The story itself should help to determine the keywords, but it shouldn't be the only source. You will also want to include keywords that reflect popular search terms. Before writing the story, the first step is to search the keywords that will help ensure the bots will index the site's data and the algorithm will show relevance to search queries. So, if your "story" is "Sell your luxury used goods with SOS" you may also want to include more general keywords such as "consignment" to be sure potential resellers find it when they search.
* How can you generate a strong list of keywords? **Keyword research**! This process is a critical step to design the content and the site's page for successful search engine optmiziation. Keywords research involves answering these questions:

* What is the topic of your article? What words and phrases best describe the article?
* What terms are your competitors using as keywords? You can find this out when you analyze their titles, meta-tags, and body copy.
* What words are suggested by **keyword generators** such as Google AdWords Keyword Tool or the Free Keyword Tool?
* What are the derivatives of your ekywords? For example, SOS might pick derivatives of handbags such as bags, purses, clutches, totes, and so on. Free SEO tools such as Google Suggest will offer variations on search terms you might not have thought of.
* How much search volume does the keyword generate compared to other keywords you might use? Is it worth using, given the resulting search volume? You can check Google Trends to see how much interest there is in your keywords. This useful tool will show how often the keyword was searched and from which geographic regions.

* SEO marketers may want to use **long tail keywords**. This term refers to multi-phrase search queries. **They are much more targeted than a general keyword because they may say exactly what the searcher wants to find. For instance, the long tail keywords for the keyword topic Hermes handbags might include "finding a gently used Hermes Birkin bag", "identifying a fake Birkin", and "best deals on designer handbags". Because the long tail keywords are actual search queries (and you can use the same tools to find these queries as you did to identify your basic keywords), they help to optimize the site.

#### OFF-SITE OPTIMIZATION
* Bots don't look only at site information as they index data and feed information back for the search engine's algorithm. They also use other indicators off-site to determine the value of a site's content. These off-site indicators include the number of links to a website from other sites, the credibility of those sites, the type of site promoting the link, and the link text (called **anchor text**) these sites use. Therefore, search engine optmizers will not stop at tweaking on-site characteristics like the title and meta-tags. They will also strive to earn links from high quality sites.
* **Links** are the building blocks of social publishing. The more links to your content, the higher the ranking you will probably receive during a search engine query. There are two approaches to build links. The first approach is to publish related content and links across other sites (branded sites and social media channels). These venues are under the control of content and links can be placed to promote traffic to the original site. The second approach is to encourage other, unaffiliated sites to link to the brand's content. This can be accomplished in different ways, such as using **affiliate marketing**, but we'll address how social media optmization builds unaffiliated links when we discuss level two of social publishing.
* **Building affiliated links to content is an extension of the first level of social publishing, in which the brand publishes related content with links back to the main site among several branded sites and social media outlets**. This is exactly what SOS did in our earlier example. In addition to using links from related content, the marketer will also strategically formulate these links to form a linkwheel. **Linkwheels** increase the number of links back to a site. They are built on a hub-and-spoke system that uses web properties (i.e., link pages) as spokes to send one link to the home site and another link to the next property. Several properties are set up as spokes; the targeted page is the hub.
* Figure 7.3 shows a sample linkwheel for SOS. The linkwheel system ensures that if a user comes to a site and clicks on a link, that site will connect to the next hub site an to the next spoke site, and son. The spoke sites can also be used as a hub in a new linkwheel as new content is developed and published. The result of this tactic is that the main site gains links from other sites with branded content using the linkwheel. When other sites link back to the content, it's called **a backlink** or **trackback**. The site's search ranking benefits then from the increase in the link quantity (this is called **link juice**). Further, all of the new sites used by the main site to promote it can also be indexed and ranked in searches. If done well, a search engine query could produce a results list with several links to sites owned by the same company.
* Linkwheels and other SEO tactics can be used appropriately, but there is room for abuse in this system. Have you watched an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land or an old western on Hulu? Cowboy with a white hat--a hero. Black hat--a villain. This western analogy applies to SEo culture. Social media insiders classify SEO marketers as white, gray, or black hats.

* **White hats** play by the rules of the system, striving to provide good quality content, with the best use of keywords and tags, and earned links at reputable sites. They create site maps so that every page is linked to every other page and search engine bots can crawl every page.
* **Gray hats** take some liberties with the system. For example, they will utilize a keyword density (the number of times the keyword is used in the body of a page) that is beyond that of the typical usage of keywords, but below that of true keywords.
* **Stuffing** (the insertion of a superificially large number of keywords throughout a site's content and tags). Gray hats also dujplicate content at multiple sites and create **link exchanges**, where sites agree to link with each other. They may also utilize **three way linking**, ensuring that their own sites link to each other in sequence and then back to the original site, and **paid links**, which are considered somewhat unethical in that linking should be the realm of earned media, not paid.
* **Black hats** manipulate the system by utilizing several tactics considered unethical in the realm of serach engine optmiziation. For example, with linkwheels, the more spokes in the wheel, the more links to the hub site. Because the search engines rank in part based on number of links, black hats simply set up a massive number of property sites linking to the hub and using the same anchor text. It works. And it's easy and inexpensive. Software can be used to automically build thousands of links using social media properties such as Tumblr and Wordpress while RSS feeds populate the content. Especially for smaller search engines, a black-hat linkwheel can send a site soaring to the top in search rankings. Big search engines such as Google combat the black hats by changing the crawler criteria and the indexing algorithm. If Google sees hundreds of links to a site, it will devalue the link, assuming there's a black hat operating behind the scenes.

* Black hats also keyword stuff and place keywords in hidden text by making the font color of keywords the same color as the page background. They may also utilize **gateway pages** (pages that real visitors are directed past) stuffed with keywords, and **cloaking** (the display of misleading content to search engines). In addition, they utilize **link forms**--groups of websites that link to each other and pages with unrelated links solely for the purpose of creating more links to the targeted pages. Finally, black hats may spam websites with links.

### LEVEL 2: SOCIAL MEDIA OPTIMIZATION
* Just as SEO tactics optimize a site to increase its exposure (through links) and search engine rankings, social media optimization employs tactics to increase the likelihood that others will share and promote content. Essentially, SMO seeks to leverage the network effect to spread endorsements of a brand with links to the brand's content. These shared links are essentially referrals--a form of testimonial from other players in the social pulishing zone. Whereas brands use zone 1 to develop relationships and engage consumers to garner influence impressions, the word-of-mouth communicaiton in zone 2 gains influence posts and referals to the brand's content. Influence posts are word-of-mouth content from published sources like bloggers and reviewers.
* What's the difference between search engine and social media optimization? Both have the same goals--to support inbound marketing and enable the target audience to find and consume the brand content. But SEO is more about finding ways to ensure search engines index the site and to calculate a good result ranking for the content, whereas **SMO is about encouraging the sharing of the content.**
* In other words, SEO focuses on manipulating the processes controlled by the search engines (because even in this social world, Internet users rely heavily on search engines to find information online). In contrast, SMO focuses on building community. SEO efforts target machines. SMO targets people. SMO is especially valuable to marketers because it improves search engine rankings. This happens because both prefer links, especially high-quality ones. For now at least, search engines tend to rate social media links as higher quality.
* As we've seen, sharing behaviour is a cultural norm in most online social communities. Content can be promoted on social networks, blogs, microblogs, and **social bookmarking** and on news sites that use **aggregators**. People can also share links to content in these channels by email. As a result, the potential impact for a piece of content can be huge. That's because as people share links to content with their network, some of those people will consume the content, and some of those will also share the content with their network, and so on.
* How do we optmize for social media? As with SEO, there are on-site and off-site tactics.

#### ON-SITE OPTIMIZATION TACTICS
* SMO is all about encouraging people who are exposed to your content to share, promote, and recommend it. To do this, the content needs to be valuable, interesting, or entertaining enough that someone wants to endorse it. We're back to the importance of good content, and you'll learn more about developing good social media content a bit later in this chapter. Aside from the issue of good content, though, we can use the title (as we did with SEO) and other site features to encourage endorsements and sharing. Search engines also consider the quality of a linking site and its type. A site will rank better in search engine results listings if independent sites link to it, and if those sites are of high quality and high relevance.
* Let's return to SOS for an example of this process. SOS is a reseller of many types of luxury items. Suppose that one of its blog posts on fashion tips is picked up by fashion blogger Reese Blutstein. Reese does a post on the tips article with a link to SOS. She is a fashion influencer and her blog, Double3xposure, is a must-follow. Reese's style is perfect for drawing attention to SOS; she specializes in minimalist, vintage-inspired pieces styled in unexpected ways. It's not long before hundreds of other fashion blogs have linked to the SOS post too. Because each of these blogs have their own linkwheel to drive traffic, SOS has a lot of potential to further spread the original post beyond the audience. Reese, for instance, maintain a presence on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
* SOS has a winner here in terms of quantity of links. But are these links of high quality? The search engine would rather see links from industry-related sites. Since SOS is a luxury reseller, links from other fashion sites would hold more value in the indexing algorithm. That's true unless the linking site is a **power site**. This label refers to a site with enormous readership, such as CNN.com. If CNN.com runs a story on how moms increasingly focus on saving money but still wish they could feel fashionable, they might reference SOS as a great site for deals. That link is going to be worth a lot of link juice to the search engine.

#### TITLE
* Our goal is to persuade people to access our content. How do users initially decide whether a site is worth checking out? The most likely candidate is simple: the title. We can enhance interst in content when we compose a catchy title. Social media pros refer to the careful crafting of a title that markets the content as **linkbaiting**.
* To continue the fishing metaphor, let's look more closely at techniques that make linkbaiting effective. You can guess what's coming next: we choose a **hook** that increases the likelihood that the intended audience will share and/or click. Hooks are used to position the content for the target audience. For example, consider this blog post title: "The Marketer's Ultimate Guide to Link Bait". The author could have titled the post, "The Basic of Linkbaiting", but realized that include the quantifier "ultimate" and the keywords "marketer" and "linkbait" would optimize the title and increase clickthrough rates (CTRs).

* The **resource hook** is a common type in social news sites. It refers to content written with the intent to be helpful to the target audience. For example, Weight Watchers might create an article titled **"5 Easy Methods to Burn Calories".**
* The **contrary hook** refutes some accepted belief. Challenging the belief incites people to read the content if only to argue the point. For instance, Weight Watchers might post an article titled **"Lose Weight With Chocolate"**, the company recognizes that this will spark an interest from those who believe chocolate can not possibily be part of a weight loss plan (just too good to be true)
* The **humor hook** is designed to show that the content will entertain. For example, a funny post about dieting might use the title, **"Obese Skunk Cuts out Bacon Sandwiches"**.
* The **giveaway hook** promises something for free. In other words, it embeds a sales promotion, an incentive offered to encourage a specific behaviour response in a specific time period into the content. For example, our Weight Watchers' article could have been titled "Save $50 Doing What's Good for you!"
* The **research hook** offers a claim about something of interest. For example, our Weight Watchers' article might claim, "66% of Americans Are Overweight, But You Don't Have to Be."

* Titles don't make content more valuable, but they do influence whether people choose to view the content and share the content with their social networks. Other title best practices include using relatively short titles (under ten words), including the words "how" or "why", and emphasizing the audience's point of view.

#### SHARE TOOLS
* People are more likely to connect to our content (using that call to action we discussed earlier) if we make it easy for them to follow through. **Share tools** are plug-ins that appear as clickable icons on a website and enable the viewer to bookmark or share the page with many social networking, social news, and social bookmarking sites. **Plugins** are third party applications that "plug in" to a main site to add some form of functionality. In this case, the functionality is the ability to easily share the site's content with external sites. Many social media sites offer their own site-specific plugin (Facebook has a Like plugin; Twitter offers a Tweet This button; Digg has a Smart Digg button) or a site may wish to utilize a multi-share tool such as Share This or Sexy Bookmarks.
* Social media are about community, so reciprocity matters. Remember the Golden Rule you learned as a child: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." You'll want to reward those who link to you by including trackbacks, which promote those who promote your content. When someone links to your site, you'll post a trackback on your site to theirs. The trackback gives attrbution to sites linking to you. It can be a method of communication between bloggers but, importantly, it provides an easy way to acknowledge those who send traffic to the brand's site by reciprocating their kindness.

#### RSS FEEDS
* One can syndicate content with an RSS feed, a tool to automatically feed new published content to subscribers. Enhancing the ase of content distribution with an RSS feed makes it easy for others to consume new content as it is offered by having that content feed directly into their feed reader or email.

#### OFF-SITE OPTIMIZATION TACTICS
* Social media suffer from an embarrassment of riches--there's way too much content available for people to process on their own. Millions of tweets are posted daily. There are hundreds of thousands of blogs. There are also corporate white papers, articles from online publishers, and other valuable content available online. Thus, average consumer can easily be overwhelmed or simply miss valuable sources of information. that's why it's important for social media marketers to optimize their socially published content. We can optimize off-site for social media. First, we can promote the content using paid and/or organic posts on SNS. Second, we can publish a social media press release to promote our content.

#### THE SOCIAL MEDIA PRESS RELEASE
* A press release is an announcement that public relations professionals issue to the news media to tlet the public know of company developments. For social media marketers, a release is also a key tool, but a **social media press release** is structured a bit differently. It should have an optmized title, good keywords and tags, links to the main site landing page, RSS feed options, share buttons, and embeddable multi-media content that can be shared on several networks, in addition to the typical release content. That's right--a press release is social when it has been prepared in a way that ensures the content is shareable. Figure 7.4 provides a template for a social media press release.
* An organization can publish a social media press release on distribution sites such as **PRWeb and Pressit**, but social media release services. In addition, organizations with a corporate blog should also post the social media press release on the blog so that it can be indexed easily by search engines.

### CRITICAL REFLECTION
DISCLOSURE IN SOCIAL PUBLISHING
* As we've seen, social media marketers can benefit from incorporating influencers into their strategy in each of the four zones of social media. In social publishing, brands pay influencers to create high-value content that endorses the brand. Brands benefit from the content, access to the influencer's audience, and the power of persuasion associated with the influencer's likeability, authority, trustworthiness, and authenticity. As influencers became a more prevalent tactic among social media marketers, the Federal Trade Commission develop guidelines for apprpriate disclosures. The FTC already protects consumers from deceptive advertising practices, but the new guides clarify what is considered deceptive in the context of social media influencer endorsements and teh expectations for disclosure under the law. If there's a connection between an endorser and an advertiser that consumers wouldn't expect and it would affect how they evaluate the endorsement, the connection should be disclosed. But that's not all the law requires. A sponsorship statement or any other disclosure necessary to prevent deception must be clear and conspicuous. A "disclosure" that consumers aren't likely to read isn't really a disclosure at all. The FTC(2013) reiterated that point in its online guide, **How to Make Effective Disclosures in Digital Advertising**, stating: "Simply making the disclosure available somewhere in the ad, where some consumers might find it, does not meet the clear and conspicuous standard".
* As social media users, do we need this protection? Apparently so--at least if Warner Bros. Home Entertainment is indicative of the lengths brands may go to in order to utilize influencers. The FTC charged Warner Bros for failing to disclose that it had paid prominent YouTuber thousands of dollars to create, distribute, and promote content highlighting one of its video games, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. The endorsement deal that influencers agreed to include several requirements. Influencers' videos, which became the property of Warner Bros., were subject to pre-approval before posting. The videos were required to feature gameplay, include positive messaging about the game, exclude any bugs or glitches in the game, and include a verbal call to action for vieweres to go to the game's website. Influencers were also required to promote the sponsored content with a minimum of one Facebook post or tweet on Twitter.
* Those requirements aren't illegal. The legal complaint arose from specific instructions fromm Warner Bros. that any disclosures be hidden deep in the video description, in an area known as "below the fold" because it is only visible if someone clicks to "show more". Some of the influencers involved in the complaint disclosed in the boscure location, but others didn't disclose at all. For instance, one influencer wrote: "This video sponsored be Warner Bros" followed by this telling statement: "No one reads this far into the description... what are you doing snooping around". Another stated, "This has been one of my favorite sponsored games, so thanks that I could play it for free!!"--failing to mention that in addition to free play, Warner Bros. was paying them thousands of dollars. In a statement, an FTC representative said: "Consumers have the right to know if reviewers are providing their own opinions on paid sales pitchees. Companies like Warner Brothers need to be straight with consumers in their online ad campaigns" To help brands and influencers, the FTC offers several guides covering the characteristics of deceptive advertising in social media and suggestion for effective disclosure.

### CASE STUDY
221BC'S SOCIAL PUBLISHING STRATEGY
* Social publishing is a critical zone for 221BC. This is because this zone best fits 221BC's mission to educate the public on the value of real food and the importance of gut health to one's overall wellness. Social publishing will support 221BC's marketing objectives by supporting some of the social media marketing tactics we discussed in Chapter 5, specifically contributing (contributing in a meaningful way) and educating (teaching, explaining, or coaching). To make the most of the zone of social publishing, 221BC must contribute meaningful content which educates the target market about the benefits of 221BC kombucha as a gateway food to total wellness. As described in the chapter, social publishing leverages content marketing, which is a startegic approach focused on creating and distributin valuable content to attract and retain the audience. It is also appropriate for 221BC's brand personality, which seeks to emphasize authenticity and integrity.
* Thsu far, 221BC's content types include blog articles, videos, recipes, and Instagram stories. It uses image posts as part of its zone of social community. 221BC's microinfluencer strategy is also a part of the zone of social publishing as this results in additional content and the ability to reach an expanded audience.
* 221BC publishes blog articles and videos on its blog, Biome 1.0, which is housed on the 221BC website at https://kombucha221bc.com/. The blog articles will be promtoed on social media channels using image posts with teaser copy and a link to the blog post. In this way, 221BC can distribute and promote its content. Some blog posts feature recipes, such as Aneta's recipe for essential oil skincare, and these recipes can also be distributed directly via social media channels like Instagram. Other blog posts explain the value of gut health, highlight foods that are go-to staples for clean eating, and provide lifestyle tips for balanced living. Looking at the Content Value Ladder, 221BC has focused on original content that is authority-building. The company should strive to develop articles that will serve as pillar or flagship content. How-to articles or videos are a natural fit for 221BC to develop pillar content as how-to articles are popular and well-suited for the educational mission of the brand. 221BC's social content strategy focuses on 1)healthy recipes, 2) tips  for clean eating, 3) whole body wellness, 4) fitness, and 5) balance across all areas of life. All of these lend themselves to titles with a resouce hook.
* The blog can be improved with the addition of share tools that would allow readers to share a link to the article with their own social networks. Share tools help diffuse the valualbe content, and the links support social media optimization. In addition, 221BC should promote these high-value articles and videos with brief Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter posts. The more people are exposed to the message, the better the results.
* Importantly, one of 221BC's founders, also invests as 221BC and highlights the brand in her stories. This helps further promtoe the brand's content while building Aneta's own personal influence.
* While social publishing is important for the brand's social media marketing strategy, it is not the only kombucha brand using social publishing. GT's Living Foods is active in this zone. It posts recipes on its website, on Pinterest, and on Youtube. While the content is somewhat repetitive across these channels, the recipe format is customized for the channel location. The Pinterst and youtube recipes are also easy to share, which provides social media optimiztion.

# Chapter 8: Social Entertainment
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. What is social entertainment? What is branded entertainment? how is it distinguished from content marketing used in social publishing?
2. How can social media marketers use social entertainment to meet brand objectives? Why is social entertainment an effective approach for engaging taget audiences?

## THE SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT ZONE
* How you played Criminal Case? Felt addicted to Pet Rescue Saga? Maybe you get your music fix on Spotify and watch and chat with your favorite telvision shows on Telfie. The third zone of social media is social entertainment. The zone of social entertainment encompafsses events, performances, and activities, which are experienced and shared using social media, and designed to provide the audience with pleasure and enjoyment. Within this zone, users can experience entertainment and share the experience with others. The distinction between the zones of social publishing and social entertainment is the orientation: knowledge-sharing versus entertainment-sharing. Broadly, social entertainment encompasses the digital and social forms of media that are otherwise addressed by the entertainment industry. By that, we mean that social entertainment channels are digitally connected, participatory, and shareable. As such, social entertainment includes social games, social enabled video games, alternate reality games, social music, and social television and video.
* Marketers can use aspects of social entertainment in several ways, along a continuum from low to high brand presence. **The level of brand presence influences the ease and complexity of execution, with low levels requiring relative little time, effort, and money and high levels requiring more substantial brand investments.** As paid media, marketers can buy advertising space in and around the source of entertainment. In this way, marketers can reach a desired audience through existing social entertainment properties. Brand integration, also known as product placements, within social entertainment vehicles can also be arranged. Brands can sponsor entertainment content in social channels. Lastly, brands can create owned vehicles of social entertainment by creating branded content, whether it be games, music, or video. This option is known as **branded entertainment**. We will focus on social branded entertainment but keep in mind that branded entertainment also exists in traditional media.
* Branded entertainment is a subset of content marketing. Content marketing is also the basis for social publishing strategies utilizing relevant, high value information desired by the target audience, as we discussed in Chapter 7. However, for branded entertainment, the content seeks to capture attention and retain that attention for a prolonged period of time (at least compared to the standard 30-second ads) and to do so by entertaining the audience. Social branded entertainment goes a step farther to encourage the audience to interact with the content and to share the content and their interactive experience with the content with their social networks. As in other social media settings, influencers can also play a role.
* This brings us to the need to distinguish between social publishing and social entertainment. Both utilize the principles of content marketing to some extent (but not entirely). Just as advertising has been associated with the goals of informing and/or entertaining, so too is content marketing. The content marketing aspects of social publishing are focused on goal of informing. The content marketing aspects of social entertainment are focused on the goal of entertaining. As a review, remember that social publishing is most akin to traditional media in that anyone (whether brand, news organization, or individual) can publish content in online channels. These channels may be part of a media-sharing site or owned media such as a blog. Across socially published content, the primary goal is to express a point of view via positive WOM about the brand, and share relevant information. Social entertainment is most akin to the entertainment industry, which provides amusement, distraction, and escape to audiences. In the marketing context, brands add value by producing social entertainment venues or leveraging popular social entertainment venues to reach an audience. Both social publishing content and social entertainment content can be distributed via social channels and vehicles, such as Youtube. While some vehicles may specialize in a specific zone, most social network sites have cross-zone functionality. This is certainly  the case for Youtube. Likewise, Facebook defines itself as a social utility because of the depth and breadth of its service capabilities across all four zones of social media.

### SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT AS PLAY
* Entertainment can be thought of in the context of play, and brands that utilize entertainment as a channel (whether via paid or owned media) are ingratiating themselves into the consumers' realm of play. Individuals voluntarily choose to actively participate in entertainment media just as they may other enjoyable activities--they play! Play and the motivations for individuals to participate include power, identity, fantasy, and frivolity. These four aspects of play are present in social entertainment. Social entertainment that builds on the "play as power" concept provides participants with a competitive task. Play as identity provides symbolic benefits to the participant in that the form of entertainment is self-expressive, reveals affinities and interests, and provides for a sense of affiliation. Social music and social film are largely thought to be most relevant to those who are motivated by play as identity. Play as fantasy encourages participants to engage in creative, imaginative experiences. Play as frivolity provides for fun, plain and simple. The goal is not challenging but relaxing. These four aspects of play are easily identifiable in all components of social entertainment. To the extent that we can understand why consumers engage in social entertainment, as marketers, we can then find ways to provide value for those target audiences that are consistent with our brand message and marketing objectives.

### SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT AND MAREKTING OBJECTIVES
* Why are brands turning to social entertainment? Social entertainment can reach audiences where and when they are spending time, in a context that enables frequent engagement with the brand message. What's more, while traditional advertising is sometimes thought of as irritating, people find value in brand integrations with entertainment. Sprout Social's Social Index report found that among millennials, 38% follow brands on social media for entertainment value. Edelman's Brand Engagement in the Era of Social Entertainment Survey found that 34% of people and 52% of those between 18 and 34 years old perceive of value that people seek out social entertainment and choose to engage with it. All forms of social entertainment, whether branded or not, provide for a more immersive and longer-lasting experience with the brand.
* In this chapter, we'll explore how brands can use social games, social music, and social video and television to meet branding objectives. Our coverage is categorized by content type, but orgagnized to reflect the brand presence continnum, from low (utilizing existing social entertainment properties) to high (developing original, branded, social entertainment content). Brands can advertise in and around social entertainment vehicles, place products in existing vehicles, and/or develop branded entertainment experiences.

## SOCIAL GAMES
* Social games make up the largest active area of social entertainment. At their core they are games, but, importantly, they are social--that is to say, they are digital, interactive, and shareable online with one's network. The context of a social game reolves around goal-oriented activity with defined rules of engagement and online connectivity among a community of players. According to the International Social Games Association, 750 million people play social games. Smartphones are credited with the surge in popularity, 84% of social games are played using apps on mobile devices. The global gaming market is estimated to be worth $152 billion, with 45% of that--$68.5 billion--coming directly from mobile games.
* What makes a game social is largely what makes any form of social media social--the existence of and participation in a community and sharing within the community. Games are social when players share their game play with others. This means that by definition social games are multi-player games. The social components of the game will be enhanced if there is communication among the players, tools to share activities and achievements, and methods to encourage others to join in the play. Therefore, we define a **social game** as a multi-player, competitive, goal-oriented activity with defined rules of engagement and online connectivity enabling conversation among a community of players. Most social games include a few key elements:

        - Leaderboards: a listing of the leaders in the game competition
        - Achievement badges: symbols awarded to show game levels achieved and shared with the communitty.
        - Friend (buddy) lists: a list of contacts with whom one plays and the ability to communicate within the game.

* The characteristics that appeal to serious gamers--the sense of competition and immersion within a dedicated community of players--can be heightened with the addition of social elements. And people who once felt games were nothing more than a waste of time for teenage boys who huddle in basements among discarded pizza boxes, now find casual, social games an enjoyable way to chase away boredom, spend time online with friends, and, quite simply, play.

### GAMER SEGMENTS
* At one time, we could easily categorize gamers based on the centrality of gaming in their lives. Gamers were either **casual** or **hardcore**, and the games they played reflected this division within the gaming community. Casual gamers play **casual games** and hardcore gamers play **core games**. Casual games are distinguished by low barriers to entry. They require only a small amount of time per session, are easy to learn, and are readily available online. For example, someone who wants to play Pet Rescue Saga can just hop online and start matching gemstones for whatever brief time he or she has available. Most casual, social games can be played using a mobile app, the most popular game variant. Studies of how people spend time on smartphones suggest that game play is the second most frequent smartphone activity (communication and social networking is first).
* In contrast, a core game such as Call of Duty: Ghost requires a much larger time investment. Core games typically require extended lengths of time per game-play session (90 minutes to several hours), are highly immersive, and demand advanced skills for ongoing play. They may be available online, or may have specific hardware and software requirements. Hardcore gamers value realism in the game's contextual clues and challenge in the game's activities; casual gamers value ease of use and immediate gratification. Although the sterotypes of casual versus hardcore gamers still hold some truth, social games are blurring the distinctions between these two types, and indeed they are bringing new gamers (and crossover games) into the mix.
* Gaming is not limited to male teens, as most of us assume. Jason Allaire, co-director of the Gains Theory Gaming Lab said, "There is no longer a 'sterotypical game player', but instead a game player could be your grandparent, your boss, or event your professor". Let's take a look at the demographic characteristics of gamers. Today a staggering 65% of American households play computer and video games. The gender mix of gamers no longer skew male--at least not when it comes to casual social games. There are gender differences in the types of games preferred. Women tend to show a preference for puzzle and trivia games. The number of female as seniors recognize the value of gaming as a social entertainment experience. Historically, casual gamers trend older and female whereas hardcore gamers skew younger and male. 
* Million of gamers are active daily and the most popular social games top 10 million players daily. Still, most social games have relatively low reach (percentage of social media users who play the game). Games by Zynga, King, and Electronic Arts are most effective, with reach estimates around 5%. There are differences in the dedication of gamers to their respective games, but overall games exhibit a high degree of stickiness. As a reminder, stickiness describes the ability of a medium to attract an audience and keep that audience. In this context, stickiness is measured as a ratio of daily to monthly game players. In other words, the stickier the game, the more often players will play. Estimates suggest that the stickiest games are Words with Friends (45%), and Candy Crush (35%). Game designers attribute stickiness to design: games are designed with a compulsion loop such that every action you experience produces a response that makes you want to do it again. When we feel pleasure, a substance called dopamine is released in our brains. Common addictions, including sex, nicotine, and gambling, all stimulate dopamine produciton. This form of reinforcement is thought to explain the prevalence of gaming as an online activity, and the growth in social game play (whether mobile or stationary) across demographic groups. According to the 2020 State of Online Gaming report, gamers spend about six hours each week playing games. For example, more than 43.7 million people play Zynga's Words with Friends each month. They average six hours of game time each month over an average of 113 sessions of game play, lasting about three minutes per session. That's a lot of game time--and a lot of opportunities for brands to interact with prospective customers.
* Gaming involves more than an investment of time, however, These activities require attention and active involvement. Unlike many other forms of media consumption, players are not likely to be multi-tasking during a game or consuming multiple forms of media simultaneously. Gamers aren't texting, talking, or using the remote to channel surf when they're engrossed in killing orcs or acquiring farmland. This heightened attention and focus is among the benefits gaming offers to marketers. While other media channels suffer from attention fragmentation due to the simultaneous use of multiple media devices (called media multi-tasking), gaming commands singular focus. Games meet all the criteria for viable market segmentation:

* The market is substantial, reachable, and measurable
* The gaming demographic has broadened so that games are now considered viable vehicles to reach women and older consumers as well as young males.
* Gamers spend sufficient, dedicated time with games to achieve valuable ad impressions.

### HOW WE CATEGORIZE SOCIAL GAMES
* Game design is built upon several layers, including platform, mode, mileu, and genre. In fact any platform can potentially support a social game environment. If the game can operate as multi-player and includes online connectivity for communication and sharing among the players, it is social. Let's take a closer look at the dimensions we use to characterize games.

#### GAME PLATFORMS
* A **game platform** refers to the hardware systems on which the game is played. Game platforms include **game consoles** (consoles are interactive, electronic devices used to display video games, such as Sony' Playstation. Microsoft'x Xbox, and Nintendo Wii), computers (including both online games and those that require software installation on the player's computer hard drive), and portable devices that may include smartphones or devices specifically for game play such as the Sony PSP or Nintendo. However, it's important to keep in mind that social games often appear on muliple platforms: gamers have strong tendency to use two or more platforms, so marketers can reach them as they move back and forth.

#### MODE AND MILIUE
* **Mode** refers to the way the game world is experienced. It includes aspects such as whether a player's activities are highly structured, whether the game is single player or multi-player, whether the game is played in close physical proximity to other players (or by virtual proximity), and whether the game is real-time or turn-based. **Mileu** describe the visual nature of the game, such as science fiction, fantasy, horror, and retro.

#### GENRES
* The **genre** of a game refers the method of play. Popular genres include simulation, strategy, action, and role-playing. Each of these genres is represented in the game market whether the games are casual, core, or social games

SKIP THE WHOLE SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT

# CHAPTER 9: SOCIAL COMMERCE

## THE ZONE OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
* When was the last time you went shopping? Yesterday? Last weekend? Were you online or in your local mall? Did you go alone or with someone else, or maybe even with a group? Shopping is at heart a social activity. Doing it with others makes the activity more enjoyable--even when your shoping buddies don't agree with your choices. Our shopping companions, known among marketers as **purchase pals**, help us to think through our alternatives and make a decision. They validate the choices we make. When we don't have a purchase pal with us, we might turn to surrogate pals like sales associates and other shoppers. Shopping together can be share activity that strengthens our relationships with others, but it also reduces the risks we associate with making purchase decisions. Perhaps this has been one reason for the prevalence of in-store shopping over online shopping. E-commerce may finally have a solution for those who hate to shop alone but who would still rather browse online while they hang out at home in their pyjamas: **social commerce**.
* Social commerce is a subset of e-commerce (i.e., the practice of buying and selling products and services via the Internet). It uses social media applications to enable online shoppers to interact and collaborate during the shopping experience, to allow buyers to complete the stages of the purchase decision process, and to assist marketers in selling to customers. Social commerce encompasses social shopping, social marketplaces, and hybrid channels and tools that enable shared participation in a buying decision. Thus, social commerce enables people, both networks of buyers and sellers, to participate actively in the marketing and selling or products and services in online marketplaces and communities. The social commerce elements covered in this chapter include ratings and reviews, curated merchandise, shopping apps including mobile chatbots, social marketplaces, social-network-driven sales, and group buys.
* Historically, wired shoppers have relied heavily on the Internet as an information source during the decision process--but many then turn to offline stores to complete the purchase.
* Increasingly through, shoppers are also completing their purchases online. Shoppers now make purchases online than offline. Mobile devices are a major factor: 79% of smartphone users have made a purchase online using their mobile device in the last 6 months. eMarketer estimates that 91% of Internet users are **digital shoppers**, defined as Internet users who have browsed, researched, or compared products digitally via any device whether or not they bought digitally. Online shopping offers many benefits to shoppers, such as the ability to comparison shop easily and efficiently, convenience, enhanced selection, and cost savings. When e-commerce is facilitated by social media channels and social software applications, the result is social commerce.
* Compared to other sources of e-commerce traffic, social media are still a minor channel, driving just 9.1% of e-commerce traffic in the US and most of that from Facebook. Most e-commerce traffic is attributed to organic search results, paid search results, and email marketing. However, social commerce is growing. Social referral to retail e-commerce sites has grown 110% in two years, outpacing all other referral channels. In addition, as social network sites add in-app shopping capabilities, consumers can complete purchases without ever leaving the social media channel. Still, just 33% of retailers in North America have embraced social commerce. Social commerce is being embraced by consumers: 30% of online shoppers say they would be likely to make a purchase from a social media network like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat. In the UK, about 39% of online shoppers between the ages of 16 and 24 have used Instagram Shopping to buy a product. In China, shoppers are engaged with social media throughout the purchase journey with 45% using social media for product discovery, 54$ using reviews and ratings to evaluate possible purchases, 25% making the purchase through a social channel like WeChat, and 27% writing reviews post-purchase. In Southeast Asia, though, 30% of all online sales occured through social network, like Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, 80% of shoppers in Southeast Asia using social media to research items and contact sellers.
* **Social shopping** is the active participation and influence of others on a consumer's decision-making process, typically in the form of opinions, recommendations, and experiences shared via social media. In other words, social shoping is the term used to capture consumers' behaviour as they use social media in their purchase decisions. In contrast, social commerce is the commercial application of social media to drive the acquisition and retention of customers.
* The Social Media Value Chain and characteristics of social communities covered in Chapter 1 are reflected in social commerce. Social network sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest serve as channels for users and brands to share information, experiences, and offers--whether peer-to-peer consumer-brand. Facebook drives the most referrals to retail ecommerce sites, but Instagram and Pinterest have the highest rates of in-app purchases. 60% of Instagram users say they find new products on Instagram so selling to them directly on the platform is a natural extension of the purchase journey. Instagram's Shoppable Posts give brands the ability to tag items in organic posts which, when tapped, bring up a new page which leads the consumer through the checkout process. Social marketplaces like Etsy and eBay are also channels for social commerce, as are social shopping malls like Wanelo, E-commerce sites can also get in on social commerce by socially enabling the site with functionality for customers to share, comment on, and review products. In each channel, users participate and engage in word-of-mouth communication that can influence purchase decisions and sales. Likewise, influencers will exist in each channel. Social software, including algorithms, apps, and bots, will personalize user experiences and provide functionality for participating in social commerce, whether by searching for product reviews, viewing recommended lists, or using voice commands to shop. Social Media Messenger sales are outperforming the current ROI champion of email. People particpate in social commerce using a connected device. Most online shopping is by desktop or laptop computer, but mobile commerce is increasing rapidly. It's not a big step to see that mobile social media use can easily integrate with mobile commerce behaviours. Plus, there are other devices enabled for social shopping, especially those with voice commands like Amazon's Echo or Google's Home.
* Social commerce lets consumers share product informaiton electronically; easily post opinions and access the opinions of others; and communicate with friends, family, and associates about shopping decisions without regard to place or time. Whenver consumers navigate product information online using social commerce tools, such as bookmarking their favorite products, emailing product summaries, and subscribing to RSS feeds of other users' favorite product lists, they are social shopping. Social shopping provides utility to our shopping experience because it lowers our perceived risk. We can feel more certain, by using social shopping tools, that we got the best price, made the best choice, and know whether our friends will approve of our decision. Perhaps that's why 84% of shoppers review at least one social media site before purchasing. It's the digital answer to our desire as consumers to shop with of others--but with added convenience and power of online technologies.

## SOCIAL COMMERCE: THE SOCIAL SHOPPING EXPERIENCE
* It's a cold day in mid-December, and David is spending some time on Instagram viewing stories about his friends' recent activities. A social ad for 1-800-Flowers appears in his feed that promotes flowers as a Christmas gift and provides an endorsement that thousands of people like 1-800-Flowers. Remembering that he hasn't yet send a Christmas gift to his grandmother in Texas, David gets a brainstorm--he really doesn't have the time to spend hours at the mall looking for something for Grammy. He clicks the link in the bio to reach a product catalog and checkout page. There he sees a promotion for 20% off his order if he "follows" the page and a "Shop Now" call to action. Daivd can browse flower selections and price points. Not sure whether 1-800-Flowers is the best choice, David first visits 1-800-Flowers' Wall. Comments from past customers fill the page, and Daivd can read the posts from satisfied and dissatisfied customers along with the responses from company service representatives. He chooses three arrangements he likes, but then he uses Facebook Messanger to ask his two sisters to help him decide which is best. They both respond within ten minutes (and as usual, they both pick the same one!) Now David is confident he's got a winner! He can use the Buy button to complete his transaction, but he wants to use Venmo to pay. He decides to use the 1-800-Flowers' chatbots, named GWYN, to place the order. By accepting Venmo payments, the flower delivery service can provide a more seamless shopping experience among younger, tech-savvy adults who have been early adopters of the peer-to-peer (P2P) post to David's feed: "David bought a holiday arrangement at 1-800-Flowers" and "David likes 1-800-Flowers". Once the flowers arrive and David knows how well Grammy lied them, he plans to return to Instagram to share a review about his experience with 1-800-Flowers. From there, the cycle begins again as another individual sees shared posts about the brand and/or social ads. Figure 9.2 illustrates how David's actions map to the consumer decision-making process--and he went through the whole process using social media!
* We all know some people who shop simply for the sport of it, and others (like Daivd) whom we have to drag to a mall. Shopping is how we acquire needed products and services, butr social motives for shopping also are important. Shopping is an activity that we can perform for either utilitarian (functional or tangible) or hedonic (pleasurable or intangible) reasons.
* A shopper's motivation influences the type of shopping environment that will be attractive or annoying; for example, a person who wants to locate and buy something quickly may find loud music, bright colors, or complex layouts distracting, whereas someone who is there to browse may enjoy the sensory stimulation. How such environments translate to social commerce shopping experience is still unknown. But we can still see where these motives may play a role in social shopping. Hedonic shopping motives include social experiences (the social venue as community gathering place), opportunities to share common interests with like-minded others, the sense of importance we experience when others wait on us, and the thrill of the hunt. After all, the role of hunter/gatherer has long been ingrained in the human psyche.
* Surely, too, there are utilitarian motives at play for social shoppers. E-commerce enabled shoppers to find alternatives and a wealth of pricing information with the click of a mouse. For example, most social commerce purchases are under $100. Consumers benefit from the convenice and ease of shopping with more choices and better information. Social commerce further enables shoppers to access opinions, recommendations, and referrals from others within and outside of their own social graphs, again potentially improving the ability for consumers to make the most rational and efficient decisions. But there's one more benefit offered by social commerce that was missing from e-commerce--the social aspect of shopping that people got when they shopped in person with their purchase pals and interacted with salespeople. Social commerce provides that missing ingredient to the e-commerce equation. For example, David trusted the reviews he read about 1-800-Flowers and his sisters' judgment when choosing a gift for Grammy (though he would probably consult other purchase pals before he buys a new gaming console). Interacting with 1-800-Flowers' gift concierge, GWYN (an acronym for "Gifts When You Need"), helped David make the purchase using Instagram, his smartphone, and the Facebook Messenger app.
* It was only a few years ago that retailers scrambled to figure out how to present their store offerings online and worried as to the effect of e-commerce on their traditional business models. Now, things are changing as they assess the influence of consumer desires to shop online socially.

## SOCIAL COMMERCE AND THE SHOPPING PROCESS
* At the end of the day, shopping online is still shopping. Sure, the way we locate and purchase products may not look the same--but the successful marketer understands that our basic shopping orientations (e.g., to obtain a needed product or service, to connect with others, to stimulate our senses) are the same as our ancient ancestors possessed.
* Furthermore, it's helpful to break down the process of shopping in terms of the stages of consumer decision-making. Though we may make some simple decisions in fewer steps, important decisions require five steps:

1. problem recognition
2. information search
3. alternative evaluation
4. purchase 
5. post-purchase evaluation

* When we look at these stages we realize that what seems at first to be an "obvious" and quick decision ("throw something in the cart") is in fact a lot more complicated. On the bright side, many current social media applications are out there to help consumers make it through each of these stages. Table 9.1 summarizes the decision-making stages and illustrates some of these social media and social commerce tools that already are changing how we shop (but not why we shop!). So social commerce is a part of e-commerce, and it leverages social media to aid in the exchange process between buyers and sellers. That seems straightforward enough, but social media are sufficiently complex and broad to influence e-commerce in all five of the consumer decision-making stages.
* **Problem recognition** may be triggered by discovering information about a product on social media, whether by user comments, influencer content, or advertising. A study found that 81% of consumers have bought something they saw shared on social media, but less than 2% said their purchases were influenced by traditional advertising. Some SNS position the network as a discovery tool. For example, 60% of those on Instagram say they curation network. A study of Pinterest users by research firm, Millward Brown, found that 96% of Pinterest users gathered information and purchase research on the site. Nearly half of the pinners surveyed were using Pinterest to plan to purchases related to a major live event--getting married, buying a home, or having a baby. Michael Yamartino, Head of Commerce at Pinterest, explained: "Pinterest is a discovery platform, in the same category as Google. For brands, it's about repurposing content from their site and publishing their entire product catalogue as you might a site map for Google to aid discovery." People in the problem recognition phase may also engage in **participatory commerce**, a subset of social commerce in which people participate in the design, selection, and/or funding of a product innovation. Sites like Threadless and Kickstarter facilitate the collaboration between prospective customers and innovators.

### EXHIBIT 9.1
BETABRAND EMBRACES PARTICIPATORY COMMERCE
* Online clothing company Betabrand crowdsources the design and selection of all the producs it manufactures and sells. Have an idea for apparel that meets an unmet need? Pitch it at Betabrand's website. Once your design is submitted, Betabrand's community will vote on the design and make suggestions for improving it. One of Betabrand's big success stories? Dress yoga pants! That's right--pants that are stylish and formal enough for work, but with the comfort and stretch needed for yoga class. They make taking advantage of that lunchtime yoga class feasible and it all happened through social commerce

===

* The next stage, information search, is the primary driver of social commerce and social shopping behaviour. We noted earlier that even for offline purchases, wired consumers tend to search online for information prior to making an actual purchase. In a book sponsored by Google, Jim Lecinski explains the process, coining the term, **ZMOT--Zero Moment of Truth**. The concept is based on a related concept long understood by retailers, and particularly those in the consumer-packaged goods industry. It draws from the notions of **First Moment of Truth (FMOT)**, the moment a consumer chooses a product from the store shelf, and the **Second Moment of Truth (SMOT)**, the moment the consumer uses the product and feels satisfaction or dissatisfaction. ZMOT emphasizes that consumers today may be influenced in several moments online prior to making a purchase decision. Through the number of sources and types of sources vary by region and product category, on average consumers will use more than ten sources of information before a purchase. These sources may be owned media content vetted by the brands in question, paid media in the form of an ad, or word-of-mouth content posted by users in social media channels. There are several sources of information available via social media, but the most influential are reviews and ratings. In a recent study, Nielsen China found that 80% of impulse purchases in China were made due to social recommendations. Savvy brands will strive to be involved in this part of the purchase process, cultivating positive word of mouth and other forms of influence impressions, leveraging the content by encouraging its spread online, and facilitating the development of the content. In fact, ratings and reviews are shared at the Third Moment of Truth.

                        * Reviews and product experiences posted on blogs

===

* ZMOT information may or may not be social, but much of it is--whether a Pinterst board of favorites at Macys.com or a review of pizza places on Yelp. This information, particularly that provided by **reviews** and **ratings**, influences consumers at multiple stages in the buying process. Reviews are assessments with detailed comments about the object in question. Ratings are simply scores generated by users that reflect assessments of attributes like perceived quality, satisfaction, or popularity on a scale. Estimates vary from study to study, but research consistently shows that the vast majority of Internet-connected shoppers globally search for product information online first.
* What makes a review or rating valuable? Ratings are a **heuristic**; a mental shortcut consuemrs use to help them with decision-making. For instance, if you want to choose a restaurant near the amphitheater where you are attending a concert this weekend, you might pull up all the restaurants in the area and then choose the one with the highest average rating. Reviews provide more detailed information for those who want to evaluate the choice at a deeper level. Consequently, a good review should include product information such as features and specifications, an overall impression of the product with a positive or negative judgment, a list of pros and cons, experience with the product, and a final recommendation. With these components, the review will have sufficient information for the readers to judge relevance and credibility and apply the content to their purchase situation.
* Where people search varies, but most start with a search engine and consequently can find all kinds of online content, including user-generated and brand-generated content on social channels. Search engines like Google are an obvious starting point for an online information search, but searches also occur on Facebook, Youtube, TripAdvisor, and elsewhere. In fact, research suggests that Amazon--not Google--is the first source of online information search for more than 50% of Internet users! Shoppers may not always complete their purchase online; instead they carry out webrooming--the term for researching purchases online but going to a brick-and-mortar store to complete the purchase. Consider these statistics on the use of ratings and reviews.

                * 95% of consumers report having read reviews prior to making a purchase decision.
                * Two-thirds of consumers read between one and ten reviews before making a purchase
                * 70% of mobile shoppers are more likely to purchase if the mobile site or app includes reviews.
                * 82% seek out negative reviews as an indicator of authenticity
                * 60% have viewed a review on their smartphone while shopping in-store

* In other words, this isn' a casual behaviour. Shoppers are intensely studying reviews to improve their purchase decisions. Researching products online makes sense--it can save time, increase confidence, and reduce risk that might be associated with the purchase. It also ensures better, more credible information. Besides using opinions early in the decision process, consumers may also use ratings and reviews as a form of validation just prior to purchase. This is called **verification**. That's right--today buyers seek out information online early in the purchase process, and then may return to validate the decision. Many later also write reviews and rate products in teh post-purchase stage (the Second Moment of Truth--SMOT). Because reviews are so influential, retailers are inviting customers to rate their experience and write a review soon after products are delivered.
* Recommendations from friends and family are all around us, and the prevalence of social media in the lives of wired consumers heightens our ability to share these opinions. The average consumer mentions specific brands in conversations with others more than 60 times a week. Just imagine how those influence impressions can travel when shared via social networks. This numbeer could increase as people use social media to seek out recommendations. A study from researchers at Penn State found that 20% of Twitter posts were from people asking for or providing product information.
* Recommendations and referrals can be simply or integrated in their execution. Facebook's "like" button, now available on millions of external webpages, is a form of recommendation. When you click it, you publicly announce that you recommend the content on the page. While others can see the total number of "likes", anyone in your network can also see that you personally made a recommendation.
* This information also influences the consumers's **alternative evaluation stage**, with shoppers reporting that they read reviews to evaluate options both for products and retailers, compared prices and checked for deals, and considered the opinions of others. Whereas ratings and reviews are visible to everyone who wishes to see them, recommendations and referrals originate from the recipient's social graph. This makes them more influential than reviews and ratings because they leverage the social capital of the referr. In fact, a Harris Interative poll fount that 71% of respondents said recommendations from family and friends have substantial influence on their purchase decisions. And while we tend to trust reviews from strangers, we are more trusting of recommendations from people we know; 90% in the survey said they trust an online recommendation from someone in their network.
* What influences the credibility and authenticity of the reviews and ratings shoppers view? Several factors are at play. People consider the source of the review (a user or product expert), the volune of ratings, and the valence (positive or negative). When a high volume of reviews and ratings is available, people tend to favor reivews from other typical people. In fact, volume of reviews has a stronger impact on sales than the presence of negative reviews. When the review volume is low, opinions from experts such as bloggers or professional critics is preferred. People look for cues to judge their similarity to the reviewer and the reviewer's purchase context. Similarity increases trust in the review. Even the congruence between the shopper's opinion and those reflected in the reviews plays a role. In other words, even when searching for information to guide a decision, people are prone to confirmation bias. **Reviews that focus on benefits to the consumer are more influential than those that focus on product attributes.**
* Even with 25% of online shoppers noting that they don't always consider online reviews to be fair or trustworthy, shoppers read the content and judge for themselves whether they feel a review is useful. Consumers trust information provided by other consumer via social media more than television, magazine, radio, or Internet advertising, more than sponsorship, and more than recommendations from salespeople or paid endorsers. The only source more trusted is that of recommendations from friends or family. The opinions of other typical users have far more influence on purchase decisions and brand attitudes than content shared by the brand itself. What about the microcelebrity influencers? A third of consumers say they are more likely to purchase a product endorsed by a non-celebrity blogger than a celebrity.
* By the time the shopper reaches the purchase point, he or she has used an average of ten sources of information with about half being a source delivered via social media. Social media users rely on social commerce in every stage of the decision-making process, but the least in the **purchase** stage. This may change as marketers improve the social shopping experience and new technologies like conversational commerce using chatbots in social messaging apps.
* The Second Moment of Truth (SMOT), the experience using the product, is just as relevant as it always was. The product has to deliver on the brand promise. This marks the beginning of the **post-purchase evaluation** phase in the decision-making process, where the consumer evaluates the purchase and experiences satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The customer may write reviews and post comments for others to use. Forrester Research points out that this is a point in the customer journey during which social media users may post questions and comment directly to brands on SNS. Social media are the most preferred communication channel for reaching company customer service representatives. Social media are preferred by more people than live chat on the company website, email, telephone, or in-store assistance. Brands using social media for customer care will be alert for these posts and respond. Marcus Miller of SearchEngineLand calls this the **Third Moment of Truth**, the moment of advocacy. Why? It's the critical juncture between a customer becoming a brand ambassador (if the communication was positive) or a customer becoming a hater. Sprout Social measured expectations for brand responses to social media customer service request. **Most social media users expect a response from a business in under four hours and 42% expect a response within one hour!** Brands that respond quicly and effective can turn complaints into positive experiences and compliments into delight. Sadly, most brands don't. Though as much as half of the social media posts directed to brands requested a response, less than 15% of those messages got a response from the brand in question. For those that did get a response, the average response time was more than eight hours. Being ignored is an insult in the conversational realm of social media. And customers response in-kind. 36% of shunned customers say they will try to shame the company online, 29% intend to switch to a competitior for future purchases, and 14% say they write negative reviews. When the customer being shunned was happy and showing brand love, future use and brand loyalty are both damaged.

#### THE MARKETING VALUE OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
* Marketers will be influenced by social commerce activities whether they choose to engage or not. That's because the reputation economy in which we live ensures that there is a publishing platform for individuals. We see content creation increase with access to social channels and communities, social software, and digital devices. Regardless of whether a brand is active, this content will be generated and will be accessible by a search online. For instance, one study of Yelp reviews looked at over 4,000 small businesses with reviews on its site. None of the businesses were also engaging in advertising on Yelp. Fortunately for them, they will benefited. The study revealed that the unsolicited, organic Yelp reviews were associated with increases in revenue of $8,000 annually on average. What's more is that brands that facilitated a presnce in Yelp saw an average uptick of $23,000. Another study found that for independent restaurants, a one-star rating increase on Yelp was associated with an annual increase in revenues of 5% to 9%.
* Product opinions affect shoppers, but taht isn't the only way they impact the marketing process. Online reviews generate increased sales by bringing in new customers. Further, people who write reviews tend to shop more frequently and to spend more onlilne than those who do not write reviews. Those who review products make up just a quarter of online shoppers, but they account for a third of online sales. And consumers are willing to pay a price premium for products with higher ratings. For e-retailers, this means that it makes good business sense to host rating and review features. Ratings and reviews also enhance organic search traffic to the website. Organic search results improve because reviewers tend to use the same keywords (tags) in their product descriptions that searchers will use. Petco, a pet supplies retailer, found that having customer reviews on its webiste generated five times as many site visits as any previous advertising campaign. Those who browsed Petco's Top Rated Products had a 49% higher conversion rate than the site average, and an average order amount that was 63% higher than the site average.
* Reviews result in better site stickiness--customers reading reviews will stay at a retail site longer than they would otherwise. They can also enhance the effectiveness of offline promotional strategies. For example, Rubbermaid added review commments from its website to the content included in its freestanding inserts. When reviews were included, coupon utilization increased 10%. Lastly, the reviews and opinion posts become a source of research data for the business, highlighting consumer opinions in a frank yet unobtrusive fashion. Some businesses believe the data resulting from online reviews to be more valuable than data from focus group research. Businesses can learn whether consumers like a competitor's brand better and why, how consumers react to positive or negative press, what stories are being spread about the brand, and which customers are being evangelical and which ones are acting as "brand terrorists". In Chapter 10, our focus will be on how marketers can use social media content as a source of consumer insight.

#### BEST PRACTICES TO LEVERAGE SOCIAL REVIEWS AND RATINGS
* Ultimately, it's important to remember that users are reading online reviews because they want to know what people like themselves think of a product. They must be able to trust t hose reviews; if they can't, the reviews won't be effective. In general, people trust reviews shared on social media, but brands must be stewards of that trust. Increasingly, reviews are questioned. Why? Deception. Estimates suggest that as many as 30% of online reviews are fraudulent. Reviews likely to be deceptive tend to include information that is not related to product use and to lack verified purchase information. These reviews may be provided by marketers (on their own products or for competing brands) or by customers who have not actually brought the product in question. Researchers estimate that legitimate reviews may come from as few as 1.5% of reviewers. Research by the Chartered Insitute of Marketing on brand transparency prevails upon brands t obe honest on social media, reporting:

* 25% have seen reviews they believe to be fake
* 21% have seen customers be paid or incentivized to post a positive review, and
* 81% find it difficult to distinguish between authentic user content and native advertising.


* Amazon has taken steps to maintain the integrity of its customer review system, which millions of consumers rely on to make smart purchase decisions and avoid faulty or sub-standard products. In some cases, Amazon has even sued individuals who offered incentivized reviews, which are reviews of a product that was received for free or at a discount in exchange for the review. A study of 65 million reviews across 32,000 product categories on Amazon by ReviewMeta found that incentivized reviewers were significantly less likely than non-incnetivized reviewers to give a one-star and four times less likely to be critical in the review. Incentivized reviewers also review hundreds of products on average, potentially inflating sales performance for otherwise mediocre quality products. In response, Amazon updated its community guidelines to prohibit incentivized reviews. 
* What other steps should marketers take? To make the most of the opportunity, marketers should develop a social commerce approach with these characteriscitcs:

* Authenticity: Accept organic word of mouth, whether positive or negative.
* Transparency: acknowledge opinions that were invited, incentivized, or facilitated by the brand
* Advocacy: enable consumers to rate the value of opinions offered on the site.
* Reciprocity: acknowledge the value of the opinions consumers offer.
* Infectiousness: make it easy for users to share reviews on blogs and social networking platforms.
* Sustainability: online opinions are so influential because they live on in perpetuity. If a consumer tells a friend about a satisfying brand experience on the phone, the story once told is no longer retrievable or trackable.

* What does this mean for marketers? First, marketers must ensure high standards when it comes to product quality and service if they wish to survive in the world of social reviews. It is so easy for anyone to tell everyone about his or her brand experiences, whether good or bad. That means those experiences had better be good--very good! Those taht fail will have their sordid story broadcast to the social world as customers submit reviews and those reviews are shared via social networks. Second, brand should embrace, not hide--because really, online there is no place to hide--from consumer opinions. Instead, organizations can engage in word-of-mouth marketing by actively giving people reasons to talk about the brand while facilitating the conversation. There are five actions brands can take to build valuable online reviews:

1. Educate people about your products and services
2. identify people most likely to share their opinions
3. Provide tools that make it easier to share information
4. Study how, where and when opinions are being shared.
5. Listen and respond to supporters, detractors, and neutrals.

* In other words, marketers should encouarge the conversation by informing consumers about the brand, offering consumers a forum for expressing opinions about the brand, and responding (making the communication two-way) to comment consumers make on the forum and elsewhere. Customers can be invited to offer reviews, resulting in more engagement and the propagation of positive word-of-mouth communication about the brand. Perhaps most important is the final component of word-of-mouth marketing--listening. There is valuable information about the need for product improvements like product features and service quality embedded in ratings and reviews

#### WHY DON'T ALL E-RETAILERS OFFER REVIEWS AND RATINGS ON THEIR SITES?
* Aside from the problem that marketers and advertisers have overlooked their value and influence, the most commonly cited reason given for not allowing online reviews on sites is the fear that dissatisfied customers will use the review feature as a venue to falme a brand. Given the old adage that negative word-of-mouth communication is more damaging than caution when it comes to offering a review feature. The ratio of negative to positive reviews found on various sites suggests that this fear is unfounded.
* In reality, retailers can benefit from negative reviews and should welcome them. Consumers want to see negative reviews to be able to accurately performance and financial risk associated with purchases. Negative reviews give them the information they need to assess risk. The negative reviews also enhance credibility. Consumers often assume taht if the reviews seem too good to be true, they probably are. Lastly, negative reviews give valuable information to the retailer on products that should be improved, augmented, or discontinued.

## SOCIAL COMMERCE STRATEGIES
* The first level of social commerce strategy is to utilize user-generated content, encourage it, and facilitate it with social sharing and shopping functionaities customers want--providing tools that make content creation and sharing of word-of-mouth communication via social media easy and rewarding. At the simpliest level, an online retailer can influence **share tools** on its website. These tools may enable visitors to tweet an item, pin a picture to Pinterest, or save an item to their Wanola. More engaging tools include thoes that enable site visitors to create **social media estimonials** using their mobile phones (with social software apps like VideoGenie) or "share stories" in an on-site gallery. eMarketer estimates that 94% of major online retailers now include such social sharing tools on their websites.
* Online retailers can also enable other features that, while not user generated, are based on user behavior and still represent a kind of social recommendation. These social commerce tools can encourage sales, brand loyalty, and advocacy. Wish lists, gift lists, and similarity recommendation (e.g., "others who bought this also bought") are examples.
* Here's a summary of the opportunities marketers can provide to encourage social commerce sharing that may facilitate sales:

* Share tools: social software plugins that enable easy sharing of products sold on a retailer's website to social networks. **The most popular plugin today for retailers is Pinterest**. This sharing is a form of recommendation in that others in the user's social graph can treat the pin as an endorsement.
* Recommendation indicators: simply buttons that provide an on-site endorsement of a product. The most common options are Facebook's "like" and Google +! buttons.
* Reviews and ratings: on-site reviews and ratings with tools for writing and rating.
* Testimonials: a form of recommendation that enables users to share a more personal story about their experience, possibly as a video endorsement.
* user galleries: virtual galleries where users can share their creations, shopping lists, and wish lists. This approach is sometimes called **user-curated shopping** and may occur on-site or off-site with a community like Wanelo.
* Pick list: lists that help shoppers share what they want on-site, typically in the form of a wish list.
* Popularity filters: filters that enable the shopper to show products by most popular, most viewed, most favorite, or most commented on.
* User forums: groups of poeple who meet online to communicate cabout products and help each other solve related problems

### EXHIBIT 9.2: HAUTELOOK: THE COUTURE SOCIAL COMMERCE EXPERIENCE
* HauteLook, a Nordstrom subsidiary, users social commerce to share content and engage end-users in purchases of couture clothing and other luxury products. Shoppers often have a two-pronged agenda: find a great deal on a product with perceived high value and then validate their savviness and fashion flair by sharing that experience with others. Membership in HauteLook implies exclusivity and scarcity to the target audience of purchasers of high-end, brand name luxury products discounted during flash sales.
* HauteLook engages consumers at each stage of the decision-making process while simultaneously focusing on creating an exceptional social shopping experience. The "Share with Friends" section of the HauteLook online store has direct customeized links to specific products and allows HauteLook to glean exposure from members sharing their purchases. The experience is also gamified in that purchases are awarded points and members can then share the "score" with friends and family, while undecided shoppers can seek input. This leverage the power of social proof to influence purchase. Social proof serves to increase desire and affirm purchase decisions. When customers share their purchases in the SNS, the announcement serves as a testimonial. Members are incentivized to invite their friends with referral bonuses of $20 off a future purchase for each friend who joins. Using flash sales for discounting creates a sense of scarcity and urgency without lowering the perceived value of the products themselves.
* HauteLook attracts new members using paid ads on Facebook and Twitter. The ads use well-designed headlines, thumbnail product images, and purchase links. Purposefully, HauteLook does not provide pricing information on the initial thumbnail image and purchase link. Consumers must click a link to obtain pricing. The clickthrough action enables HauteLook to capture lead generation data for prospects that are farther in the purchase decision funnel and which can be used to retargeting.
* Its social commerce initiative also includes social media monitoring to alert the social media team when consumer posts request a response, and a fast and thorough response. This system enables the company to provide customer care and customer relationship management using social media channels.

## SOCIAL PROMOTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS
* In addition to leveraging user-generated content both through on-site tools and cross-platform partnerships, marketers can also facilitate sales using sales promotions offered through social deal partners and shopping carts in social vehicles like Facebook and Twitter. The most extensive format would be to truly socialize the shopping function on the retailer's website. A few adventurous retailers gave this a shot (most notably, Levi's), but thus far, full implementation has not gain momentum. Amazon is perhaps the world's most friendly retailer for social shopping, but synchronous, shared online shopping experiences are still not featured.
