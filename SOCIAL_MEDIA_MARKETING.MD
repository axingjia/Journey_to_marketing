# Chapter 1: The Social Media Environment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
* When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. What are social media? How are social media similar to, yet different from, traditional media?
2. How does the Social Media Value Chain explain the relationships among the Internet, social media channels, social software, and the Internet-enabled devices we use for access and participation?
3. What are the major zones of social media that make up the channels, modes, and vehicles for social media participation?
4. What is social media marketing? What marketing objectives can organizations meet when they incorporate social media in their marketing mix?

## IT's A SOCIAL WORLD
* When you woke up this morning, what was the first thing you did? Sure, you may have taken a moment to gulp down some juice or coffee, but odds are you also checked your mobile for texts that came in overnight. Maybe you set you Snapchat Story. Perhaps you scrolled through a few tweets or checked WhatsApp. You certainly aren't along: one survey of people from 31 countries reported 96% of them use their smartphone within an hour of waking up, often before they get out of bed.
* Face it--you're a digital native. If you're a typical student, you probably can't recall a time when the Internet was just a static, one-way platform that transmitted text and a few sketchy images. The term digital native originated in a 2001 article by Marc Prensky (2001) titled "Digital natives, digital immigrants." He tried to explain a new type of student who was starting to enter educational institutions. These students--students like you--were born in an era in which digital technology has always existed. You and your fellow digital natives grew up "wired" in a highly networked, always-on world. It's an exciting time--but it continues to change so constantly that we need to study it carefully.
* Today the Internet is the backbone of our society. Widespread access to connected devices like personal computers, digital video and audio recorders, webcams, smartphones, and wearables like smartwatches ensures that consumers who live in virtually any part of the world can create and share content. Worldwide, there are about 4.38 billion global Internet users today--that's roughly 57% of the world's population. Most Internet users, about 45% of the world's population, are active on at least one social network. That's about 3.5 billion people. Of course, social media penetration does vary by global region, with the lowest penetration rates reported in Central Asia, Africa, and South Asia. Even these areas are expected to experience growth, at least in part due to Internet access via mobile phone. Mobile penetration is 67% worldwide and 63% of mobile users are active on social media via mobile applications. Curious about social media usage in a specific country? We Are Social, a global social media marketing agency, provides data on every country in the world in its Digital Yearbook. Odds are you already participate in this wired world.
* Information doesn't just flow from big companies or governments down to the rest of us; today each of us communicates with huge numbers of people by a click on a keypad, so information flows across people as well. The fundamental change in the way we live, work, and play is characterized in part by the prevalence of social media. **Social media are the online means of communication, conveyance, collaboration, and cultivation among interconnected and interdependent networks of people, communities, and organizations enhanced by technological capabilities and mobility.** Does that sound like a complex definition? It is...because social media exist within a complex and rapidly advancing environment. We'll dive deep into the social media environment, but first let's explore the making of a social media life--your life.

## LIVING A SOCIAL (MEDIA) LIFE
* The Internet and its related technologies make what we know today as social media possible and prevalent. Every day the influence of social media expands as more people join online communities. The average Internet user has accounts within eight different social media services and spend more than two hours a day on social media. Facebook, a social utility that offers synchronous interactions (which occur in real time, such as when you text back and forth with a friend) and asynchronous interactions (which don't require all participants to respond immediately, such as when you email a friend and get an answer the next day), content sharing of images, video, music, games, applications, groups, and more, has at the time of writing more than 2.2 billion active users worldwide. What's more--more than 1 billion of those users are mobile users. If Facebook were a country, it would be the most populated in the world. Do you wonder why Facebook is called a social utility? A community that got its start as a social network, Facebook offers functionality far beyond basic relationship building. It not only competes with social channels ranging from video and photo sharing to blogs; its Facebook Live, Marketplace, and Campaign ensure it competes with e-commerce sites, news sources, and other advertising media channels. Facebook also owns the top two social messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messanger, as well as the top photo- and video- sharing network, Instagram.
* people aren't just joining social communities. They are contributing, too! Let's take Youtube as an example. Youtube users (Youtube has around 2 billion users) upload more than 300 hours of video every single minute of every day. That's roughly equivalent to 1,500,000 full-length movies uploaded weekly. Youtube hosts local versions in more than 100 countries and users can navigate Youtube in 80 different langues. It's perhaps not surprising then to learn that Youtube users watch more than a billion hours of video each day (and more tahn half watch on mobile devices). Google the phrase "social media stats" and you'll see mind-boggling facts and figures about the number of people who use social media, what they're doing (and when) with social media, and their reach and influence. This has been done for you in Table 1.1. And take a look at Figure 1.1 an infographic that highlights fun facts about some of the most popular social sites.

        Table 1.1: Mind-Boggling Social Media Stats
        * It took radio 38 years to reach 50 million listeners. TV took 13 years to reach 50 million users. The Internet took 4 years to reach 50 million people. In less than 9 months, Facebook added 100 million users
        * Just over 13% of Facebook users are in North America; more than a third of users are in the Asia Pacific region
        * More than 90% of companies use Linkedin as their primary recruiting tool
        * The top Youtuber, like PewDiePie and Lily Singh, earn millions of dollars each year
        * Generation X (ages 35-49) spend the most time on social media--6 hours and 58 minutes per week. Millennials (age 18-34) come in second, spending 6 hours and 19 minutes of their time per week on social networks
        * Two-thirds of Internet users worldwide use social media
        * While Facebook dominates in size and penetration worldwide, Instagram dominates in user engagement. Brands see a median engagement of 0.09% per Facebook post, in comparison of 1.60% median engagement rate per post on Instagram 
        * QQ, Webchat, and Qzone, social networks with heavy user bases in Asia, are more popular than Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest

* When we introduce the definition of social media earlier, we admitted it's a complicated idea. It's difficult to fully capture the realm of social media because of the expansive nature of sites, services, and behaviours that are a part of this rapidly expanding digital universe. There are simply too many social websites, too many things we can do online, and increasing access using a variety of devices to grasp it all at once.
* More generally, however, we can think of social media as the way digital natives live a social life. To sum thigns up, it's all about a culture of participation; a belief in democracy; the ability to freely interact with other people, companies, and organizations; open access to venues that allow users to share content, fromm simple comment to reviews, ratings, photos, stories, and more; and the powr to build on the content of others from your own unique point of view. Here's just a brief look at some of the things you might do with social media:

* Share and document an event using live video.
* Watch television while discussing the program on social media.
* Create a blog to share your favorite recipes
* Coordinate a book club meeting and negotiate a group discount on the book's purchase price
* Mobilize a group of people to protest against an unpopular policy on your campus
* Instant message or voice chat with friends to carry on a synchronous conversation online.
* Share an infographic with your friends.
* Locate the best vegan restaurant in a city you're visting for the first time based upon reviews by other vegans
* Make your own animated video and share it
* Keep a travel diary of a trip abroad complete with photos , videos, journal entries, and destination ratings.
* Raise money for a charity or even find backers for a startup company who are willing to fund part of your costs.
* Find people you use to know and reconnect with them.
* Entertain yourself and your friends with short social games

* The list could go on and on. Our point? Social media enable active participation in the form of communicating, creating, joining, collaborating, working, sharing, socializing, playing, buying, and selling, and learning within interactive and interdependent networks. Thus, social media are interactive and participartory. It's an exciting time to be around!
* While social media users have embraced social media, its infrastructure has developed in ways that have made social media pervasive and ubiquitous. Social media intersects with websites, platforms, and media devices. The result is that people today live in what can be thought of as an omnisocial world.

## THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
* The environment of social media is like a volcano that suddenly erupts within warning. Within a few short years we've seen an ever-expanding domin of activities, channels, technologies, and devices that are changing how we think about our lives (e.g., in the old days a "friend" was someone you actually knew in person!) As a student of social media marketing, recognizing the parameters of the field and how the pieces of the puzzle fit together will benefit you as you develop skill as devising social media strategies and tactics. The Social media Value Chain, shown in Figure 1.2, organizes this complex environment into its core components.

        Figure 1.2
        * Infrastructure
        * Channels/Hosts
        * Supporting Software and Services
        * Devices
        * Share-Create-Talk-Work-Buy/Sell-Learn

* The value chain illustrates the core activites of social media participants and the components that make those activities possible. As a social media user, you are empowered to participate in any way you'd like, from just "lurking" on a site to scripting, filming, and uploading your own video stories. Those activities are made possible by the underlying infrastructure of social media's techno-social system. just as in the physical world where we need infrastructure in the form of roads, railroads, TV transmitters, and trained people to operate and maintain these structures, in digital environments the pieces that make up the social web are crucial. These include the web, the social channels and vehicles, the software that provides the programming we need in order to carry out these activites, the device (iPad, smartphones, computers) we use, and of course the parcipants--the people and organizations whose contribution porvide the content we all access. Let's take a closer look at each of these elements.

## THE WEB AS PLATFORM
* Just as the Internet is a foundation for the web, the web is the foundation for social media. Because social media are not possible without this infrastructure, it is the first supporting component we identify in the Social Media Value Chain. To put it simply, the Internet is a network of connected data servers. Initially, th web (what we now call Web 1.0) was a network of connected information. People browsing the Internet were merely consumers of the Internet's most static contents. Web 1.0 was the era of cognition, in which a network of data producers served information to primarily passive consumers. Web 2.0 marked a major shift by connecting networks of people in addition to networks of information. Tim O'Reilly (2005), founder of O'Reilly media and the first to define Web 2.0 explained Web 2.0 as "development in online technoology that **enable interactive capabilities in an environment characterized by user control, freedom, and dialogue."** Web 2.0 offered a cost-effective solution that provides access to rich data; the collective wisdom of its users, access to micromarkets; software that operates on multiple platforms (mobile phone, personal digital assistant, computer) and beyond (cloud computing); and user interaces that are easy, accessbile, and interactive.
* From these advances blossomed the "social web" and an era of communication, in which networks of networked communities have members who participate as consumers, creators, and co-creators. Each additional user adds value for all users. Economists refer to this as a **network effect**. Amazon's ability to recommend books to you based upon what other people with similar interests bought in the past gets better as it tracks more and more people who enter search queries and make purchases. When you're visiting a new city and want to find a great restaurant on Yelp, you feel more comfortable with a place that 1000 diners recommend than one that only ten users rate. You get more value from Facebook as more of your friends also use the network. Network effects enable organizations to leverage the value of **crowdsourcing**, a process that harnesses the collective knowledge of a large group of people to solve problems and complete tasks. Organizations use crowdsourcing to benefit from the collective wisdom of crowds, but the network effect ensures that there is sufficient participation for the crowdsourced solution to be a good one.
* Web 3.0, the **Semantic Web**, is the expected next stage. First envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, this iteration of the web makes it possible for people and machines to collaborate. The web will be a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange. It will mark an era of collaboration--not only of people, but also of people and machine. In other words, devices (yes, machines) will be contextually, socially, and network aware and be able to dynamically create social connections between each other and connected people in order to offer services to each other and to jointly solve problems. In other words, social media will eventually serve to support **collective intelligence**. while some elements of Web 3.0 exist--especially the presence of services made possible by social software, the capture of user-generated data, and the mining and processing of the data--it is not yet fully realized. We remain in a stage known as Web 2.x.

## SOCIAL CHANNELS
* Social channels are the networks and platforms that support social media functionality and connections. We cover these in the section of the Zones of Social Media

## SOCIAL SOFTWARE
* So far we've learned that the social media environment supports many activities. But much of our experiences and what we are able to create or do online is due to a host of **social software** applications. These are computer programs that enable users to interact, create, and share data online. For virtually everything you'd like to do online, there is a social software program (or several) that can help you. **Interested in planning an event? Use an event planner and invitation service like eVite.com.** Want to keep a notebook of wedding ideas that you can share with your bridesmaids? use Evernote.com, or create a board of hot new wedding gown styles on Pinterest (watch out for those hideous bridemaids' dresses). Need to keep a new feed of all the latest happenings at your school? Use Paper.li or Google Alerts. Want to create an e-book to share on Linkedin? Use Designerr. Social software can facilitate interation, content creation, sharing, syndicating, saving, analyzing, filtering, sorting, and searching data online. Such tools are certainly useful to individuals, communities, entrepreneurs, and businesses. Examples include mixir (for producing live radio shows and podcasts), Xtranormal (for video production), and Prezi (for presentation).
* You've heard of the phrase "There's an app for that!" It's no wonder given that there are currently more than 1.2 billion apps available through digital stores like Google Play. Those apps, also known as widgets (usually downloadable or embeddable), are types of social software. In addtion to apps, social software also encompasses application service sites that we call social services. Importantly, social sofware exist to facilitate all social media channels. There are applications for social community activities, publishing, entertainment, and commerce. Importantly, these apps largely enable mobile connectivity to our social spaces and activities. Blurring things further, open application programming interface (APIs) and other platform technologies have enabled countless third-party websites to integrate with social network sites. A more recent development is the chatbot, an artificial intelligence computer software program that simulates intelligent conversation via written or spoken text using a chat interface, such as Facebook Messanger or Webchat. Chatbot can provide a number of conversational services ranging from functional to fun.
* Social software also operates behind the scenes in ways that affect your social media experience. Social sites use complex mathematical formulas called algorithms to personalize the content you see in your news feed, recommend friends connections, and more. Dominique Cardon, author of What Are Algorithm Dreaming of? likens algorithms to a recipe in that they are a series of instructions that produce a desired result. When you browse nearby restaurants on your phone, view movie recommendations on Netflix, or check Youtube on how-to videos, algorithms likely played a role in the outcome.

## DEVICE
* Devices are pieces of equipment we use to access the Internet and the range of activities in which we participate online. We utilize connected hardware devices like tablet PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, Internet-connected game consoles, traditional laptops and desktops, and even televisions for social media access. As a consumer, we may focus primarily on connected devices like smartphones and other smart devices, especially those that provide mobile access to social media. Globally, 93.4% of social media users participate using a mobile device. Today's smart devices also include refrigerators, thermostats, and even cars. Wearables are smart devices that can be carried or worn on one's body. They measure and capture data, which can then be stored, shared, and further processed. Fitness wearbles like Fitbit, which measure activity levels and share the information with online communities, have experienced the most adoption thus far, but they represent a small portion of wearable devices. For instance, Snapchat Spectators, camera-equipped sunglasses, enable users to take video and upload it to Snapchat with the touch of a button.
* Even devices that aren't "smart" on their own can become so by using an Internet of Things gateway. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a paradigm in which all the object around us could be connected anytime and anywhere. Gateways are devices that can facilitate connection for objects without network capabilities. So far most applications are industrial, but expect to see consumer applications in surprising areas. Absolut, the vodka company, is experimenting with manufacturing its bottles as IoT-enabled objects! Smart devices are a first step in the evolution toward connecting machines as users, alongside people in social media. Ultimately, social connection among machines will transform them from passive data-collecting devices into active members of a thriving digital ecosystem, capable of creating social connections, solving problems, and offering services.

## PEOPLE
* Social media work only when people participate, create, and share content. Journalists, editors, and publishers still matter in social media, but so do every day individuals. You see this visualized in Figure 1.2 as a series of activities typical in social media participation. This is why we hear so much about citizen journalists (amateurs who post about newsworthy events) and citizen advertisers (people who share their iews about a product or service even though they're not affiliated with the company). Bloggers represent a unique hybrid form of "netizens" in that they may create and share content professionally or personally. Publishing a blog is surely a bigger commitment to sharing content than is posting a status update to your Facebook wall, but both actions generate content and add value to the social media environment. Still, people aren't the only actors in social media. As a techno-social system, other participants include businesses and brands, government organizations, community groups, media companies, content producers, and so on.
* Our coverage of the Social media Value Chain isn't complete without a review of social channels and related vehicles in and through which social media participation takes place. We address these channels, known as the zones of social media, next.

## CHANNELS: THE ZONES OF SOCIAL MEDIA
* The word media has multiple meanings, but for our purposes we'll simply use it to refer to means of communication. The media we use range from ass media (means of communication that can reach a large number of individuals) such as broadcast, print, and digital channels, to personal media (channels capable of two-way communication on a small scale) such as email, surface mail, telephone, and face-to-face conversations. Social media cross the boundaries of mass and personal media, so they enable individual to communicate with one or a few people as well as to thousands or even millions of others.
* Communication travels using a medium (or channel) such as **word of mouth, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, signage, Internet, direct mail, or telephone**. Within each medium, marketers can choose specific **vehicles** to place a message. For example, within the medium of television, marketers may choose Stranger Things as one vehicle to broadcast their message. Cosmopolitan and Fast cmopany are vehicles for the magazine medium. Social media are socially enabled online channels, and like other media, there are numerous vehicles within each channel.
* Part of the comlexity of social media is due to the sheer quantity of channels and vehicles, with new ones coming online all the time. These options are easier to compare and contrast if we group similar channels together. In so doing we can conveniently organize the social media space into a compact space that consists of what we call the four zones of social media. Figure 1.3 illustrates the four zones of social media channels, and we've organized the book around these groupings:

        * Zone 1 is Social Community: Sharing, socializing, conversing
        * Zone 2 is social publishing: Editorial, Commercial, User-Generated
        * Zone 3 is Social Entertainment: Games, Music, Art
        * Zone 4 is Social Commerce: CRM/Service, Retailing/Sales, Human Resources

* You'll note, as we discuss various uses of social media for personal and commercial purposes, that some areas overlap two or even more zones. That's the fluid nature of social media. All social media are networked around relationships, technologically enabled, and based on the principles of shared participation. The four zones framework isn't set in stone for this reason--but it is a very useful way to cut through the clutter and focus upon the most important functions of each social media platform--including those that haven't been invented yet.

## ZONE 1: SOCIAL COMMUNITY
* Social commmunities describe channels of social media that focus upon relationships and the common activities people participate in with others who share the same interest or identification. Thus, social communities feature two-way and multi-way communication, conversation, collaboration, and the sharing of experience and resources. **All social media channels are built around networked relationships, but for social communities the interaction and collaboration for relationship building and maintenance are the primary reasons people engage in these actiivities.** Many of the channels in which you already participate likely reside in this first zone. The channels in the social community zone include social network sites, message boards and forums, and wikis. All emphasize individual contributions in the context of a community, communication and conversation, and collaboration.
* Social network sites (SNS) are online hosts that enable site members to construct and maintain profiles, identify other members with whom they are connected, and participate by consuming producing, and/or interacting with content provided by their connecctions. Profile picture enhance the ability of members to develop a **social identity** when they add a prfoile picture or avatar, basic information about themselves, and other customizable options. Members maintain a **social presence** in the community that may indicate their availability, mood, friend list, and status. **Connections**, whom we might call *friends, followers, or fans,* communicate and share content in a vareity of ways, including direct messages (akin to email within the social network site), wall posts (post to a profile, visble to others), and chat or instant messaging (IM) options. Thus, SNS offer both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communication, and the resulting content may be either permanent or temporary. Snapchat's popularity is largely attributed to its disappearing messages. SNS add value to users by offering and/or enabling applications. Facebook offers thousands of apps, ranging from games to dating to weather forecasts to safety check-ins. Though the services provided by app functionalities heighten user engagement, the focus of SNS is on the individual communication and collaboration within the context of connections in the community. We'll delve deeper into these characteristics and uses of SNS and social communities in Chapter 6.
* Given the dominance of Facebook and other major players, it's easer to assume that there are only a small number of social networks. In fact, there are hundreds of SNS vehicles. But are you familiar with Steemit, DriveTribe, Whisper, Houzz, or Thumb? SNS exist to meet the needs of their users and many provide niche communities.
* **Forum** are perhaps the oldest venue of social media. Essentially, they are interactive, online versions of community bulletin boards. They focus entirely on discussions among members. Members establish profiles as they do in SNS and participate by posing content including questions, opinions, news, and photos. Others then respond and extend conversation as they post responses; this results in a threaded discussion. There are thousands upon thousands of forums active online, most oriented around a common interest. For example, RC Universe (www.rcuniverse.com) is a vibrant community of remote-control hobbyists.
* **Wikis** are collaborative online workspaces that enable community members to contribute to the creation of a useful and shared resource. Wikis can be about anything and everything. A wiki could be created by a family community to share and update family history, or by an appliance manufacturer that is trying to develop the perfect user manual. The software that supports the wiki enables multiple members to collaborate, edit, make comments, and share a variety of content.

## ZONE 2: SOCIAL PUBLISHING
* **Social publishing** is the production and issuance of content for distribution via social publishing sites. Social publishing sites aid in the dissemination of content to an audience by hosting content while also enabling audience participation and sharing. While social networks met the need for online communities, social publishing made it possible for people to share their content, user-generated content (UGC), without the barriers and gatekeeping of traditional publishing and broadcast models. It is a key reason we associate social media with democracy in that social publishing democratized content production and dissemination. That said, today, individual users are not the only social publishers. Professional content creators like journalists, traditional media organizations like newspapers, and brands develop content for and publish on social publishing sites. We categorize social publisers into four use group: 1) individual users, 2) independent professionals, 3) professional contributors associated with organizations such as news media, and 4) brands. Brand use social publishing as a distribution and/or promotion mode in **content marketing** campaign. (Content Marketing Institute)
* The channels of social publishing that we will feature in Chapter 7 include blogs, microsharing sites, media-sharing sites, and social bookmarking, and news sites. Social publishing channels enable participation and sharing, just as social communities do. The distnction between these two zones is in the primary orientation. **The orientation of social communities is networking, while that of social publishing is knowledge-sharing.**
* **Blogs** are websites that host regularly updated online content; they may include text, graphics, audio, and video. Blogs may be maintained by individuals, journalists, traditional media providers, or organizations, so they feature a wide range of topics. Thus, there are blogs that operate much like an online news source or magazine, a tabloid, or simply as an online personal diary. Blogs are social because they offer social share tools, and they are participatory because they include option for readers to leave comments that can result in threaded discussions related to specific posts. Several services are available for formatting and hosting, including Blogger, Wordpress, Squarespace and Weebly.
* **Microsharing sites**, also called microblogging sites, work much like blogs except that there is a limit to the length of the content you can post. A **microshare** could include a sentence, sentence fragment, embedded video, or link to content residing on another site. Twitter, the most well-known microsharing vehicle, limits post to 140 characters. Others include Plurk and Parler.
* **Media-sharing sites**, like blogs, host content but also typically feature video, audio (music and podcasts), photos, and presentation and documents rather than text or a mix of media. Media-sharing sites host content searchable by the masses, but within each vehicle are options for following content posted by specific people. Thus, media-sharing sites are also networked. Here are some prominent vehicles within different types of media

        * Blogging: Tumblr, Blogger, Wordpress
        * Video Sharing: YouTube, Vimeo, and Vsnap
        * Photo sharing: Flickr, Snapfish, and Instagram
        * Music and audio sharing: Audiofarm, and Soundcloud
        * Presentations and documents: Scribd, SlideShare, SplashCast, BrightTalk, and SlideBoom.
        * Social bookmarking services (i.e., sharing links to other sites): Diigo and Digg

## ZONE 3: SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT
* The zone of **social entertainment** encompasses events, performances, and activities designed to provide the audience with pleasure and enjoyment, experienced and shared using social media. The distinction between the zones of social publishing and social entertainment is the orientation: knowledge-sharing versus entertainment-sharing. The topic of Chapter 8, these include social games, social music, video and social television. The social media channels supporting this zone include communities dedicated to entertainment like Spotify and TikTok, as well as multi-zone social networks like Youtube and Instagram. At this stage in the development of social media, **social games** constitute by a substantious margin the most advanced channel in the social entertainment zone. These are hosted online and include opportunities for interaction with members of a player's network as well as the ability to **statuscast** (post updates to one's status) activities and gaming accomplishments to online profiles. Examples of social game vehicles include Candy Crush and Mafia Wars.

## ZONE 4: SOCIAL COMMERCE
* Our fourth zone is **social commerce**. The topic of Chapter 9, social commerce refers to the use of social media in the online shopping, buying, and selling of products and services. Social commerce encompasses social shopping, social marketplaces, and hybrid channels and tools that enable shared participation in a buying decision. Thus, social commerce enables people, both networks of buyers and sellers, to participate actively in the marketing and selling of products and services in online marketplaces and communities. **social shopping** is the active participation and influence of others on a consumer's decision-making process, typically in the form of opinions, recommendations, and experiences shared via social media. Channels include reviews and ratings (or review sites like Yelp or branded e-commerce sites), **deal sites** (like Groupon), **deal aggregators** (aggregate deals into personalized deal feeds), **social shopping markets** (online malls featuring user-recommended products, reviews, and the ability to communicate with friends while shopping like Wanelo), **social storefronts** (online retail stores that sometimes operate within a social site like Facebook with social capabilities), community marketplaces (peer-to-peer sites like Etsy), and social networks with sales conversion functionality. In addition, organizations can socially enable aspects of their traditional e-commerce websites by using tools such as **Facebook Connect** (a Facebook tool that allows users to log in to other partnering sites using their Facebook identities) and **share applications** (tools that let users share what they are buying). Figure 1.4 illustrates the four zones of social media along with several vehicles prevalent in each zone at this time.

        * Social Community: Twitter, facebook, linkedin, reddit, instagram
        * Social publishing: Blogger, Tumblr, Wordpress, Medium, Youtube, SmugMug, SlideShare, Scribd
        * Social Commerce: Facebook, Shopify, Groupon, Etsy, VideoGenie, TripAdvisor, Payvment
        * Social Entertainment: Come2Play, Spotify, DevianArt, youtube, mySpace, Zynga, uGame

        MY:
        * Social community: Reddit, 
        * Social publishing: linkedin, medium, Youtube
        * Social commerce: Facebook,
        * Social Entertainment: Youtube

## MONETIZATION AND SOCIAL MEDIA
* As wired individuals, we've come to rely on many of the social sites and services and available online. And for marketers, social media have created one of the most exciting and efficient opportunities to reach target audiences. But have you ever thought about how those social sites earn revenue? Most sites still feature free access and a buffet of valuable tools and services. Yet those organizations have invested in potentially extensive development costs and time, hosting costs, and ongoing maintenance. Though it's standard business practice to invest capital to pave the way for future profitability, how do these organizations earn revenue if many of  the platforms are free to use?

### BUSINESS MODELS AND MONETIZATION
* Just like other businesses, social media providers (whether they are social communities, utilities, software providers, or game and app developers) need a **monetization strategy**. **Monetization** refers to how a business earns revenue. It must make money if it is to survive. if a system requires substantial new investment as users adopt it, the break-even point for return on investment (ROI) is delayed even as it appears to be a success. This plan is part of a company's overall **business model**--the strategy and format it follows to earn money and provide value to its stakeholders. For example, Google derives most of the revenue from its widely used search engine (where you "google" a term to locate relevant online links) from the fees it charges advertisers to put their messages on the results pages. In contrast, eBay makes most of its money by taking a cut of the proceeds each time a seller fulfills an order from a buyer on its merchandse pages. Two different business models, both ways to return value to the sponsoring organization.
* For decades now, media providers (e.g., the big networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox) and media conglomerates (e.g, Disney, Viacom, and Time Warner) have relied heavily on a business model we call the **interruption-disruption model**. The goal is to create programming that is interesting enough  to attract people to watch it or listen to it. Then, when they have your attention, they interrupt the programming to bring you a commercial message. They sell ad space to marketers who want to gain the attention of a targeted audience, and the audience allows this to happen in return for access to programming they want. The monetization strategy relies upon attracting as many people as possible to the content; the more who pay attention (or who at least tune in even though they may not be paying attention), the more the programmer can charge for the right to insert messages in that vehicle.
* Many social media sites still use this same strategy of earning revenues from selling ad space (Did you notice the text ads delivered alongside your Facebook news feed today?). Though some companies have other revenue stream (or source of income), typically through subscriptions to premium versions or fees for data, these are unlikely to replace the model of "adspace as revenue". Despite the value of services and content found online, the culture of the web is one of open and free access..
* Because social media are built on participation, and the more content, the better, people's contributions also have value. Should you have to pay for online content? Believe it or not, way back in the old days (i.e., before 1999) it never occured to consumers that they should not pay for content. That's when a college student named Shawn Fanning introduced the Napster site that enabled music lovers to share tracks for free. That party lasted only two years before legalities caught up with the service, but by then the cat was out of the bag. Now, many people (not to point fingers, but especially college students) believe that "information wants to be free", and they gravitate toward technology that enables them to download songs, newspaper, and yes, even textbook without cost.
* As attractive as that sounds, in the long run an entirely free world probably isn't feasibly. Remember the old expression, "there's no such thing as a free lunch?" At the end of the day, someone has to pay for content and services. Music artists and novelists (and yes, even textbook authors) can't create and receive nothing in return (for long, anyways). However, the restarant review on Yelp you won't get a check in the mail for your comments. But you may get "paid" by the satisfaction of sharing your foodie opinions with the uneducated masses. You may even receive a rating on some sites that designates you as a star reviewer. These are forms of **psychic income** (perceived value that is not expressed in monetary form) that help to grease the wheel of social media. Also referred to as **social currency**, people and brands need to earn a reputation for providing high value--whether that value comes from information, relevance, and/or entertainment.

## SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* Social media are a valuable context for marekting because of their access to people and their functionality. According to the American Marketing Association, **marketing** is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offers that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. The classic view is that organizations accomplish these goals through a **marketing mix** that includes the so-called Four Ps: Product, Price, Promotion, and Place (or distribution).
* As social media marketing techniques continue to sprout around us, today we need to add another P. Participation. It's fair to say that just as social media are changing the way consumers live on a daily basis, so too these new platforms transform how marketers go about their business. Whether our focus is to improve customer service, maintain customer relationships, inform consumers of our benefits, promote a brand or related special offer, develop a new product, or influence brand attitudes, new social media options play a role. **Social media marketing** is the utilization of social media technologies, channels, and software to create, communicate, deliver, and exchange offerings that have value for an organization's stakeholders. We can see this definition play out in emerging trends in social media. While social media marketing initially influenced brands' promotional plans, more recent business applications include social funding (e.g., Kickstarter for funding new business ventures).

### MARKETING COMMUNICATION: FROM TOP-DOWN TO BOTTOM UP
* Just as the horizontal revolution changed the way society communicates, the advent and adoption of social media change the way brands and consumers interact. Traditional marketing focuses on **push messaging** (one-way communication delivered to the target audience) using a large dose of broadcast and print media to reach a mass audience. There are minimal opportunities for interaction and feedback between customers and the organization, and **boundary spanners** (employees who interact directly with customers) mediate these dialogues. The brand message is controlled in a top-down manner by brand leadership within the organization.
* Even as digital technology developed in the 1990s and beyond, marketers still eseentially applied the traditional Four Ps model to reach customers. Over time they embraced the Internet as an environment for promotion and distribution. Ecommerce began to blossom as an alternative to other forms of promotion such as television, or radio. Consumers increasingly began to learn about product online--and to purchase them online as well. Ecommerce sites are websites that allow customers to examine (onscreen) different brands and to conduct transactions via credit card.
* This explosion in ecommerce activity was a boon to manufacturers, retailers, and nonprofit organizations because it offered greater speed, cost efficiencies, and access to micromarkets. A **micromarket** is a group of consumers once considered too small and inaccessible for marketers to pursue. Suddenly it became feasible for even a small company that offered a limited inventory to reach potential customers around the globe. The Internet enables efficient access to these markets, and in turn allows customers to search for very specialized products (e.g., music tracks by bands that recorded bass line music in Sheffield, England, between 2002 and 2005, or steampunk science fiction novels written by K.W. Jeter) to offer **niche products** that appeal to small, specialized groups of people.
* As it became clear that the Internet was not going to go away, marketers flocked to cyberspace. however, most of them still applied the familiar model of the Four Ps to the digital domain. This form of marketing, **traditional marketing**, is characterized by improvements in interactivity and measurement, but it retains the primary vertical flow of power in the channels of communication and distribution. Digital online messages made it possible for consumers to respond directly to an online **display ad** by clicking through to the ecommerce website. **Search advertising** grew during this time too, making it possible for online advertising to target both mass and miche audiences. Direct marketers widely adopted email marketing as a complement to direct mail and telemarketing.
* Despite these developments, modes of communication were still primarily vertical, one-way "mass communication", largely impersonal, and delivered from one to many. Whether you read the front page of the New York Times online at www.nytimes.com, or the new York Times app on your phone, or peruse the physical newspaper at your kitchen table, the content from the publisher is delivered vertically thorugh the channel of communication.
* Both traditional and tradigital marketing work on the basis of teh interruption-disruption model we discussed earlier. This means that the source of a communication delivers messages to audiences whether or not they want to receive them, and regardless or whether these messages are directly relevant to their unique needs. By design, an advertising message interrupts some prior activity: a commercial for L'Oreal mascara suddenly appears during the lastest episode of Real housewives, or perhaps a popup buble asks you to click on a link to learn more about low rates on car insurance while you browse a website.
* Why would Internet users tolerate these disruptions as they surf the web? For the same reason television viewers and radio listeners have for decades. The ad as interruption that provides a stream of revenue for the media provider also enables this sponsor to provide the content of interest at little or not cost to the audience. Television programming exists to draw audiences, which enables the network to sell space to advertisers who wish to reach that audience. The audience in turn accepts the presence of the advertising who wish to reach that audience. The audience in turn accepts  the presence of the advertising in order to consume the desired programming. This "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" relationship also describes the traditional Internet advertising: before you can watch a full episode of the Walking Dead on your laptop, you might sit through a 15 second ad for Verizon Wireless.
* In contrast, social media empower consumers. it isn't enough to interrupt the consumer experience and steal a few moments of attention. With social media marketing, the ability for consumers to interact and engage with brands is greatly enhanced. Social media channels give consumers unparalleled access. Consumers discuss, contribute, collaborate, and share--with brands and with each other. The culture of marketing has shifted to an informal one focused on the belief that customers are in control. Marketing guru Peter Drucker once famously said, "The purpose of a business is to create a customer". With the reach and community influence of social media, we can expand this definition: The purpose of a business is to create customers who create other customers. That participation in the process is the new fifth P of marketing.
* In the few years of social media's existence, social media marketing has expanded rapidly, as much for its efficiency given its low absolute as for its potential business applications as a tool for garnering customer attention, managing customer relationships, developing new product ideas, promoting brands, driving store (online and offline) traffic, and converting consumers to customers. Social media are not a substitute for traditional marketing communications, but they are more than a complement to traditional methods, as you'll see throughout this book. This shift from traditional to tradigital to social media is illustrated in Figure 1.5.

        * Boarcast, Print, Radio, Outdoors
        * Traditional Marketing: mass media, push orientation, outbound messaging, attention gained via orientation

        * Display ads, microsites, email, search
        * Tradigital marketing: mass and targeted online media, push orientation, outbound messaging with interactivity enabled

        * Networks, Communities, Blogs, Microblogs
        * Social Media Marketing: Niche online media, attraction orientation (pull), content attracts inbound traffic, attention gained via interactivity, dialogue, participation, sharing

### SOCIAL MEDIA ACHIEVES MARKETING OBJECTIVES
* As social media marketing has accelerated over the last few years, the objectives organizations can accomplish have also expanded. Table 1.2 shows the percentage of marekters using social media marketing to accomplish objectives across a range of marketing activities that include promotion and branding, customer service, relationship management, retailing and commerce, and marketing research.

        Table 1.2: Top Priorities for Business Using Social Media Marketing

        Social Media Marketing Priorities | % Companies Using
        * Brand awareness and brand building | 88.2
        * New product introduction | 64.7
        * New customer acquisition | 60.1
        * Brand promotions (e.g., sales promotoins, contests) | 59.2
        * Customer retention | 55.5
        * Customer service | 40.8
        * Employee engagement | 35.3
        * Market research |33.6
        * Targeting new markets | 25.6
        * Identifying new product opportunity | 17.2

* Just as the digital lives of consumers intersect across the four zones of social media, brands reach consumers in those same spaces to build awareness, promote themselves, and encourage users to try them. Let's take a closer look at some of the ways they do this.

## PROMOTION AND BRANDING
* Marketers have many possible techniques to promote goods, services, ideas, places, or people. Though there are potentially dozens of specific promotion objectives marketers may seek to accomplish, there are two overaching objectives relevant to the use of social media marketing as part of a brand's promotional mix:

1. Extend and leverage the brand's media coverage
2. Influence the consumer throughout the decision-making process.

* When it comes to acquiring space in media to distribute brand messages, **marketers have access to four core types of media: 1) paid, 2) owned, 3) earned, 4) shared.** This is illustrated in the PESO model, shown in Figure 1.6. Marketers are charged monetary fees for **paid media**, including purchasing space to deliver brand messages and securing endorsements. Paid media are traditionally the purview of **advertising**, defined as the paid placement of promotional messages in channels capable of reaching a mass audience. **public relations**, the promotional mix component tasked with generating positive publicity and goodwill, may also utilize paid media in the form of sponsorships. **Television commercials, radio ads, magazine print ads, newspaper ads, billboards, Internet display ads, and search engine marketing (SEM) all represent examples of paid media that may be incorporated in a brand's promotional plan. As we'll see in later chapters, other emerging formats include paying for messages in online games like Happy Pets or offering branded virtual goods to inhabitants of virtual worlds. And traditional sales promotions such as coupons and contests get a new life on social media platforms.

        FIGURE 1.6 PESO Model

        * Earn: Publicity, Media relations, Blogger relations, Investor relations, Influencer relations

        * Shared/Earned: (Influencer engagement), Response to detractors, Detractors turned loyalists, Detractors turned advocates

        * Shared: Facebook (living streaming), Twitter, Linkedin, Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram, Vine, Google

        * Owned: Websites, employer stories, customer stories (case studies), user-generated content, reviews, brand journalism, webinars/videos/podcasts

        * Paid/Owned: Affiliate, Brand ambassador, Sponsor content, native advertising (advertorial), Expert content

        * Paid: Facebook-sponsored posts, Sponsored tweets, Twitter cards, lead generation, TV & Other advertising, Direct marketing, Sales promotion

        * Paid/Earned/Shared/Owned: Optimized content, shared content, engaged content

* **Owned media** are channels the brand controls. Corporate websites and e-commerce sites, corporate blogs, advergames, and alternate reality games (ARGs) all represent forms of owned media. Just as Zara's brick-and-mortar retail stores are owned and controlled by the organization, so is its website.
* **Earned media** are those messages that are distributed at no direct cost to the company and by methods beyond the control of the company. **Word-of-mouth (WOM) communication** (called **influence impressions** in social media) and publicity are important forms of earned media. Comapnies release content through press releases and paid channels, participate in community events and causes, create stunt designed to generate media attention and buzz, and offer exceptional service quality, all with the hope that a brand message will spread. Shared media are communication channels in which marketers, people, journalists, and other participants share content (their own and others). Note that there is an overlap such that there are paid, earned, and owned elements of social media. Table 1.3 explains the forms of paid, earned, and owned media possible in each of the shared zones of social media marketing.

                Table 1.3: Types of media

                1. Zone: Social Community

                                * Branded entertainment
                4. Social Commerce

                                * Social storefronts

* A major objective related to using social media marketing for promotional purposes is to assist in moving the consumer through the purchase process. Marketers target various stages of this cycle to increase brand awareness, enhance brand liking and image, build brand equity, incite desire, and move consumers to action. They can influence consumer attitudes and movement through the process with promotional messages targeted throughout the social media channels. Figure 1.7 illustrates how marketers can use each zome of social media.

                FIGURE 1.7: Marketing Applications Across the Social Media Zones

                Social Media Marketing:

                Social Community:

                        * Enabling play 
                        * Branded entertainment

* Let's take a brief look at how social media marketing works at each stage of the purchase process:

1. Increase awareness: brands can increase awareness with social media marketing by maintaining an active presence in the social spaces where target consumers "live" and by integrating social media into the marketing mix. Unilever brand Knorr's "#LoveAtFirstTaste" campaign matched singles with similar food preferences, then set them up on dates, where they had to feed each other (and agree to be recorded). The campaign included an interactive flavor-profile quiz, a campaign landing page, and a series of social videos, including a popular Youtube video.
2. Infuence desire: social media promotion can be used much like advertising, catalog marketing, and feature events to persuade consumers to recognize a sense of desire. The fashion brand Lilly Pulitzer posts each new collection on Facebook, Flickr and Youtube. Visitors can tour pictures of its designs, fresh from each photo shoot. It's like being in the pages of Vogue.
3. Encourage trial: social media can even be used to support sampling and loyalty programs. **Sampling** means to offer a free trial of a product; these are usually mailed to consumers' homes or distributed in stores or on the street. Social media can be used to recruit interested prospects to qualify for samples. Celestial Seasonings used this approach to distribute 25,000 samples of its new tea flavors. Called Share the Magic, Facebook followers were asked to share how tea adds magic to their day and, in return, Celestial Seasonings sent a free sample and a coupon.
4. Facilitate purchase: social media serve as a distribution channel and venue for many sales promotion incentives, including deals and group offers. Many customers "like" or follow brands in social networks in order to qualify for special deals. The "You Can With a Canon" campaign rewarded those who rented a Canon M50 to claim a discount by posting their finest photography along with the hashtag "rentacanon".
5. Cement brand loyalty: social media venues offer engaging activities for consumers that can ensure they spend more time with the brand, hopefully resulting in higher levels of brand loyalty. Look no farther than social games that offer rewards for the most loyal visitors. That's just what grocery chain Lidl accomplished in the UK with its ingenious Social Price Drop campaign on Twitter. The campaign was designed to let its social media followers control pricing for select products during the holiday season. The more followers talked about an item on Twitter, such as the "Christmas lobster", the more that item's price dropped.

## CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE RECOVERY
* Despite all the hype we hear constantly about social media being the "new advertising", there are in fact other applications where these techniques will play an increasingly important role. For one, customer relationship management, or CRM, also finds a home here. CRM practices focus on what we do with a customer after the first sale; it's far more difficult (and expensive) to attract new customers than to keep old ones. That's why many organizations work hard to maintain contact with their customers and to provide additional products and services to them over time. Often they rely on sophisticated databases that keep an ongoing customized follow-up messages and offers that are likely to meet unique needs. Salesforce.com is among the leading business solutions for social CRM.
* Because of this digital focus, it's not surprising that CRM lends itself to social media applications. **Social CRM** embraces software and processes that include the collective intelligence of a firm's customers to more finely tune the offer and build intimacy between an organization and its customers. When brands embrace social CRM, they use social media as they were meant to be used. Why do we make this claim? Just as we learned that earned media can result from creative and interactive social messages, companies that do a good job of maintaining strong brand-to-customer relationships will benefit from earned media, as those customers in turn share information and recommendations with their networks.
* But this is a sword that cuts both ways. It's ideal when all of our interactions with customers are positive. Unfortunately, things sometimes go wrong. When they do, today's social consumers won't hesitate to share their nasty experiences with others on social platforms. They'll vent their frustrations in the most public of ways. A great example is the sad story of one man's plane trip that resulted in a busted guitar that went viral on Youtube (United Breaks Guitars" video on Youtube). After he tried unsuccessfullly to get United Airlines to repair or replace his guitar, this disgruntled passenger created his own version of the story and set it to music--the video he uploaded about his experience was viewed nearly 10 million times. Obviously, this was not a happy event for the airline. This illustration of the potential negative impact on a firm's image underscores how important it is for organizations to take customers commplaint seriously (especially those who are inclined to post about their experiences). It is also vital to have a plan in place to initiate **service recovery** when thigns do go wrong (and they will). This term refers to the actions an organization takes to correct mishaps and win back dissatisfied customers. One helpful set of guidelines that some companies use is known as the **LARA framework**
* **Listen** to customer conversations.
* **Analyze** those conversations.
* **Relate** this information to existing information within your enterprise.
* **Act** on those customer conversation

* Service recovery typically has to happen quickly if it's going to have any immpact. A firm that can identify a problem in the system (e.g., a product recall, a snowstorm that will ground flights) can nip it in the bud by letting customers know that it is aware of the issue and is taking steps to address it. That's a big reason why social media can play such a big role in CRM: the platforms they can use allow them to commmunicate quickly and efficiently to large groups of customers or to customize messages to individuals who require follow-up. For example, companies such as Carphone Warehouse, Zappos, Best Buy, and Comcast have turned to Twitter to conduct their social CRM: they can monitor trending topics and pre-empt problems if they find that a lot of people are tweeting about them (in a bad way). If neccessary, they can sent their own tweet to explain what happened and provide solutions.

## MARKET RESEARCH
* Social media open exciting new windows for marketing research. Whether to collect insights for the discovery stage of the creative process or to gather ideas for new product development, social media provide new tools to listen to customers as they discuss their lives, interests, needs, and wants. In fact, this social media marketing activity is called **social listening**. Social listening may be used for social CRM, service recovery, competitive analysis, or even ideas for new product development. We'll learn more about conducting research with social media in Chapter 10. Which channels of social media are relevant for social media market research? Potentially all of them, but profile data, activities, and content shared in social communities and content shared via social publishing vehicles are especially valuable for researchers.

## RETAIL AND ECOMMERCE
* The last major application for social media marketing is taht of retailing and ecommerce. We've already shared ways that brands can incentivize trial and purchase using social media promotions. If you are like most consumers, you've used your share of online ratings and reviews before you made a purchase decision. But did you know that you can go shopping in social storefronts or browse on ecommerce sites that enable real-time chat with your friends? That's right. Groups of friends can shop together even when everyone is online--and not necessarily in the same physical location. When brands use social media marketing as a retailing space, create a venue for and/or encourage consumer reviews and ratings of products, and enable applications that help friends shop together online, we've solidly in the social commerce zone. This will be our focus for Chapter 9.

## CRITICAL REFLECTION

### HOW ALGORITHMS INFLUENCE REALITY
* Algorithms are instructions for solving a problem or completing a task. Recipes are algorithms, as are math equations. Computer code is algorthmic. The Interest runs on algorithms and all online searching is accomplished thorugh them. The app on your smartphone are algorithms. Computer and video games are algorithmic storytelling. Anytime you are offered automated suggestions--whether people you may wish to friend on Facebook, programs to watch on Netflix, products to consider on Amazon, possible romantic matches on Tinder, restaurant recommendations on Yelp (we could go on)--algorithms are responsible.
* Algorithms help gadgets respond to voice commands, recognize faces, sort photos, and build and drive cars. Algorithms are mostly invisible aids, augmenting human lives with convenient knowledge delivered on demand. However, sometimes the application of algorithms created with good intention leads to unintended consequences. As you might have guessed, criminals exploit algorithms for hacking and cyber attacks. Algorithms are also blamed for unfortunate issues in the currency and stock markets.
* But algorithms are the subject of this critical reflection feature because of the effect they may have on your experience using social media--and ultimately on your life. In fact, some are calling this the Age of Algorithms. Algorithms are primarily written (by coders) to optimize efficiency and profitability without much thought about the possible societal impacts of the data modeling and analysis. A study of experts by Pew Research explained that in algorithmic design, humans are viewed simply as an "input" to the process, rather than as real, thinking, feeling, changing beings. This is already problematic, but is likely to become more so as algorithms begin to write the algorithms. At that point, the robot will decide the rules by which the algorithms produce solutions.
* Bart Knijnenburg, a professor at Clemson University, explained (cited in Rainie & Anderson, 2017): "Algorithms will capitalize on convenience and profit, thereby discriminating (against) certain populations, but also eroding the experience of everyone else. The goal of algorithms is to fit some of our preferences, but not necessarily all of them: They essentially present a caricature of our tastes and preferences." He went on to say, "My biggest fear is that... it will be simply too convenient for people to follow the advice of an algorithm (or, too difficult to go beyond such advice), turning these algorithms into self-fulfilling prophecies, and users into zombies who exclusively consume easy-to-consume items".
* Perhaps zombies is an exaggeration, but the risk of living in a filter bubble is real. What is filter bubble? Akin to living in a bubble, unable to experience the world, algorithms can limit our exposure to new information and different experiences, while influencing our beliefs and emotions with the content that is served to us. Is this risk real? In fact, it's already happening. Your news feed in Facebook is controlled by an algorithm designed to personalize the content you see based on your preferences and past behaviour. These are benefits--it means you see more of the stories you have liked in the past, from people and brands you've interacted with most, with the goal of enhancing your experience. It is this filtered access to our social network that inspired the quesiton "is social media even social anymore?"
* Do you see the flaw. The flow of content you see isn't random or even in real time. It is filtered such that you are increasingly less likely to see stories from people with whom you haven't engaged for a while. You will see more stories from people you agree with and less from people who might have a different opinion. Over time, you could adopt a very distorted view of the world. You also will be limited in new experiences. The information presented by algorithms will never surpise you will something you never thought you'd do, watch, or see because the solujtions are based on your past behaivour.
* That is, unless the solution are manipulated. What's that? You trust the information you get online? Not so fast. Facebook scientists collaborated on an experiment called the Contagion Experiment. One sample of Facebook users were served consistently negative stories and another sample saw positive content. Did the content influence the recipients? You bet it did. Those in the negative group began posting content that suggested they were in a bad mood and those who saw positive content posted happier messages. In other words, not only may our experiences by influenced by algorithms, our perceptions of our experiences may as well.

## CAREERS IN SOCIAL MEDIA
* Now you've seen how individuals and organizations, including businesses, non-profits, and governments, use social channels. As organizations learn the value of social media for marketing, new jobs come online every day to accommodate the need for skilled social media marketers. Interested?

## CASE STUDY

MEET 221BC KOMBUCHA
* 221BC Kombucha is a family-owned business dedicated to promoting healthy lifestyles. Aneta and Eric Lundquist founded the company to inspire people to live their best lives one step at a time. Drinking kombucha, a nutrient-dense beverage with many health benefits, is a gateway habit to a healthy lifestyle.
* Kombucha is a bubbly, fermented tea with a host of health benefits. The basic ingredients in hombucha are yeast, sugar, and black tea. SCOBY, which stands for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, is an ingredient used in the production of kombucha. The mix is set aside for a week or more to ferment. Simply put, fermentation is where the activity of friendly bateria, yeasts, and probiotic enzymes eat the sugar in tea, transforming it into kombucha. The process is similar to how cabbage is preseved as sauerkraut or kimchi, or how milk is turned into yogurt. The tasty end product has B vitamins, probiotics, caffeine, and small amounts of alcohol.
* Kombucha has a long history. In fact, the name 221BC highlights the first known reference to the brewing of kombucha in China more than 2000 years ago? It was known as the "Tea of Immortality"! Aneta explains, "Kombucha is an ancient drink from Asia. The recipe is over 2000 years old. That's where our name came from--221BC stands for '221 before Christ'. We use high-quality organic tea leaves and sugar and ferment that in a culture, then add fresh-pressed, raw, organic unprocessed juices. It creates probiotics, enzymes, B vitamins. There's a trace amount of alcohol--less than 5 percent--but it's not considered an alcoholic beverage. (personal communication).
* Today, the kombucha market is growing rapidly. Globally, the market is projected to reach nearly $5 billion by 2025.
* Why the rapid growth? It goes beyond the popularity of beverage alternatives to soda. Kombucha purports to have many health benefits, especially benefits for gut health. Advocates say kombucha aids digestion, rids the body of toxins, and boosts energy. It's also said to boost immunity, support weight loss, ward off high blood pressure and heart disease, and even present cancer.
* Growing up in Poland, fermenting foods was a regular part of Aneta Lundquist's life. Every fall, her family harvested food from the garden. Some of that food was stored in underground cellars, while the rest was fermented in jars. Culturally, food was viewed as medicine for common aliments. After coming to ther US, Aneta realized that she didn't feel the energy she once felt. She committed to eating clean foods and using nutrient-dense foods as a core commitment to her family's health. She began brewing her own kombucha at home, experimenting with ingredients like bee pollen, turmeric, ginger, and matcha to influence the flavor and nutrition of her home brew. As the family transformed their eating habits, their health also improved dramatically, convincing Aneta's husband, Eric, that clean eating and kombucha should be a way of life.
* Today, Aneta defines herself as fermentarian; fluent in the language of good bacteria, she feels a natural connection to and understanding of the complex world of microbes. She's become obsessed with nature and the power of food to support a healthy life. With this goal in mind, she and Eric decided to begin 221BC Kombucha. Their mission goes beyond selling kombucha. Kombucha is simply one step that can serve as a gateway to healthy living.
* 221BC's product line offers several unique flavor blends, including:
* Berry Hibiscuss
* Grapefruit Bee Pollen
* Ginger
* Moringa Lavendar
* Orange Turmeric
* Jun Honey Matcha
* Lemon Cholorophyll
* Acai Beet
* Reishi Chai Core
* Yerba Power Green Core
* Yerba Power Berry Core
* 221BC is sold throughout and in a few major regional markets throughout the US, as well as abroad. Its channel of distribution is indirect in that it is sold through retailers such as Publix and Whole Foods. It is also sold on tap at healthy food bars and yoga studios. The company uses a premium pricing strategy with each bottle priced at or around $3.99 to $4.29. Competitively, 221BC is a relatively small player in a market overflowing with major brand like GT's Living Foods and Health-Ade as well as regional and niche brands.
* The company plans to use social media marketing to facilitate achieving its marketing objectives. Throughout an ongoing case study in this book, we'll walk side by side with Aneta and Eric and 221BC plans its social media marketing strategy. Currently, 221BC is active in the Social Community zone. you can follow 221BC and Aneta:

## SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* Marketers rely upon consumer insights to plan effective social media marketing strategies. Whether planning a campaign that will be executed entirely in social media or one for which social media are one component of an integrated marketing communications (IMC) campaign, understanding the needs, beliefs, and behaviours of the target market is key. Marketers use these insights to develop buyer personas that facilitate the strategic planning process. This is the focus of Chapter 2. We'll review the basics of segmentation, discuss individual and group behaviours in social media and why those behaviours occur, and detail segments found in social media communities.

## PROFILING THE TARGETED SEGMENTS
* Marketers value social media marketing strategies and techniques, but social media marketing will work only to the extent that these new media platforms can reach the customers that organizations want to talk to in the digital space. Marketers target specific segments whose needs they believe the brand is capable of satisfying in exchange for meeting organizational objectives. **Market segmentation** is the process of dividing a market into distinct groups that have common needs and characteristics. Segmentation enables marketers to achieve a trade-off between the efficiency of treating all customers the same and the effectiveness of addresssing all customers' unique characteristics. Marketers use several variables as the basis to segment markets, including geographic, demographic, psychographic, benefits sought, and behaviour. These characteristics represent the **bases of segmentation** marketers use when they divide a population into manageable groups.
* Marketers utilize these variables to segment and identify target audiences regardless of what kind of strategy will be used. But when it comes to social media marketing, we need to also take into account how prospective customers can be segmented according to their digital lives. Although it may seem like everyone is online, and most everyone is on Facebook, the extent to which a person's life is digital varies based on his or her lifestyle, personality, demographics, and even his or her geographic and economic conditions. For B2C (business-to-consumer) marketers, understanding these segments and how their attitudes and behaviours differ is a critical component in devising an effective social media marketing strategy. Marketers use this information and insight to develop profiles that help marketers make better campaign choices. Likewise, B2B (business-to-business) marketers also benefit from segmentation-driven targeting. Table 2.1 reviews the segmentation bases and exemplar variables. Let's briefly review the bases of segmentation and try to understand how these variables translate into the online world.

                        * Climate
                        * Environmental context (e.g., Indoor or outdoor)
                        * Language

## DMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* When marketers employ **demographic segmentation** they utilize common characteristics such as age, gender, income, ethnic background, educational attainment, family life cycle, and occupation to understand how to group similar consumers together. For example, General Mills creates specialized campaigns for different demographic segments, such as when it launched QueRicaVida.com as an online platform for Latina moms. B2B marketers also use demographic variables for segmentation but the variables of interest will relate to company size, industry vertical, buyer type, and other characteristics useful for describing businesses. Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin have made it easy for businesses to target prospects by offering targeting specifications based on information like interests, job title, company size, revenue, and more. When it comes to social media marketing, demographic segmentation help marketers to choose the right channels. This is because each SNS has a unique user profile. For example, Pinterest and Instagram have a larger percentage of female users than male, while Reddit has more male users. Facebook has a larger base of older users, while TikTok has a larger base of tweens and teens.

## GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* **Geographic segmentation** refers to segmenting markets by region, country, market size, market density, or climate. For example, North Face can expect to sell more parkas to people who live in winter climates, whereas Roxy will move more bikinis in sunny vacation spots. Geographic segmentation is increasingly relevant to social media marketers, not only due to location-based targeting based on a business's distribution channel, but also because social media increasingly incorporate **GPS technology**, a satellite system that provides real-time location and time information.
* The innovation aids local businesses that can use the technology to target specific people based on physical presence. Services such as Yelp position themselves as geotargeted social media. Yelp became popular for its user-generated reviews of local businesses. In fact, Yelp users have contributed more than 177 million reviews of local businesses. In mobile app helps users search for nearby businesses with the added value of reviews, ratings, and photos. Businesses can partner with Yelp to target Yelp users with adertising and in-app coupons. This is where segmentation strategy comes into play.
* For social media marketers, there are three geolocation techniques: geofencing, geotargeting, and beaconing. **Geofencing** is like a vritual line around a defined geographic space. As people with a geolocation mobile app enter the defineed area, they can be targeted with ads or offers. For example, if you have a smoothie shop at the mall, you could set up a geofencing around the mall and parking lot. As soon as people (with their devices enabled) come into that geofenced area, you can show them an ad with a deal. It's this same kind of functionality Snapchat uses to offer Snapchat geofilters--visual overlays that relay the "where" and "when" a Snap was taken. **Geotargeting** is similar to geofencing but the geographic parameters are more general, such as 50 miles from a zip code. The third type is **beaconing**, which has a very small range and is best for targeting locations within a store.

### EXHIBIT 2.1: YELP's GEOTARGETING ADDS VALUE
* Yelp's mobile app averages more than 20 million unique users per month. As Yelp mobile app users enter tageted geographic areas, local businesses in that area can reach out to them with special offers and interactive promotions such as free drinks or discounts. In fact, this is perhaps the most relevant strategies that engage on the social, mobile level. Importantly for the local merchants who use the service, Yelp offers a business "dashboard" that includes customization options for the business's page information and promotional offers, metrics on the number of Yelp views, notifications of new reviews, and message functionality for communicating with reviewers and heavy users. Through Yelp began primarily as a review site to help people find local businesses, it now incorporates transactional services as well. These include Eat24, YelpNow, SeatMe, and Request-A-Quote. Such services enable yelp to close the gap in the consumer decision-making process between information search and evaluation of alternatives and purchase. The services also provide another stream of revenue, in addition to advertising, for Yelp. Worried about privacy? We address privacy later in this chapter.

## PSYCHOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
* **Psychographic segmentation** approaches slice up the market based on personality, motives, lifestyles, and attitudes and opinions. These variables may be used alone to combine with other segmentation bases such as demographics. Psychographics tend to provide the richest picture of a consumer segment in that the description of psychographic segments help marketers to know the real person making the consumption decisions. Psychographics are important to consumer insights but they are also actionable for targeting purposes. For example, GoPro can target social media posts based on people's interests like hiking or skiing.
* Let's consider a practical application of psychographics in the social media space. The greeting card industry has experienced declining sales for some time now. Instead of cards, people may send emails, e-cards, a direct message (DM), or even just a Facebook post! A large-scale study by Unity Marketing identified four psychographic segments among greeting card buyers. Unfortunately for the greeting card industry, a segment called "Alternative Seeker", the largest group the study identified, is also the most eager to use an alternative to the traditional card. Alternative Seekers view social media as an answer to stay in touch with friends and family on both a daily basis and on special occasions such as birthdays and holidays.
* Unity's report warns that greeting card companies are at risk as people use social media as a replacement for traditional cards. But this change presents an opportunity for others. Apps like Touchnote and justWink create a variety of virtual greeting cards that can be delivered on Facebook and other social networks. Even Starbucks enabled a Twitter app that lets you give a cup of coffee to someone with a simple tweet!

## BEHAVIORAL SEGMENTATION
* **Behavioural segmentation** divides consumers into groups based on their actions. Exemplary variables include product research sources, the nature of the purchase, brand loyalty, usage level, frequency of purchase, and distribution channels used. Notice that these very same variables are valuable for B2B segmentation. When it comes to social media, marketers may use **behavioural information such as how much time prospective customers spend online and on social media, what activities they participate in on social media, which social networks they use, and the devices they use to access social media as segmentation variables.** Behavioural segmentation also helps with ad targeting. For example, you can segement and build target audiences for Facebook advertising based on people's past engagement with your Facebook page and ads.
* According to Global Web Index's Social Flagship Report, people's social media behaviour is a valuable segmentation variable. It categorized social media users based on their primary following patterns in social media and **found that people can be categorized into social usage personas like personal networkers, celebrity networkers, brand followers, and shoppers.**

## BENEFIT SEGMENTATION
* **Benefit segmentation** groups individuals in the marketing universe according to the benefits they seek from the products available in the market. For example, in the auto industry people who buy hybrids and electric cars look for different benefits from a car than those who buy muscle cars or SUVs. For business prospects, benefits sought might be about "how soon can it be delivered" or "can the purchase be invoiced?" The Job-To-Be-Done theory is useful for understanding benefits sought. It holds that to create a product or service that customers want to buy, marketers must understand the outcomes prospective customers are seeking. In other words, we need to understand the job the customer needs the product to perform.
* Brands may use social media to identify benefits customers want. That's how McDonald's identified the demand for its new "All Day Breakfast" menu--more than 80,000 tweets specifically mentioned the need for breakfast options all day. What benefits do consumers want from their interactions with brand in social media environments? There are competing want from their interactions with brands in social media environments? There are competing schools of thought on this issue. Some industry experts argue that consuemrs want to have meaningful relationships with the brands they use frequently, and particularly with those brands they consider lovemarks. This term, developed at Saatchi & Saatichi, refers to brands that inspire passionate loyalty in their customers.
* Others believe consumers seek a more functional relationship with brands, but will offer loyalty for those that meet their needs. This is the view taken in research on the social currency of brands.**social currency** measures the ability of brands to fit into how consumers manage their social media-centric lives. Based on the premise that social consuemrs are defined by the extensive use of technology and social media, liimited time and attention for decision-making, and a desire for value and utility, the social currency construct assesses brand contribution to several desirable benefits. How do ocnsumers respond to brands with high social currency? The study, which assessed 90 brands over five industries, found that people were more likely to choose these brands and more willing to pay a price premium.

### MINI CASE STUDY: THE POWER OF SOCIAL CURRENCY
* The Power of Social Currency was designed to measure the ability of brands within retail, fashion, automotive, food, and beer to adapt to the ways consumers manage their social lives. The report asserted that brands often struggle to keep up with changing consumer preferences. To succeed in social currency, brands should focus on initiatives across seven dimensions that help consumers manage their lives more effectively and efficiently. The modern social consumer is defined by a number of different characteristics that contribute to a desire for social currency benfits:

* manage their lives and achieve their goals using technology across context and culture
* make decisions with limited attention, time and effort
* use social media for information and entertainment, and
* comparison shop for cheaper and/or more convenient alternatives

7 Social Currency Dimensions
* How much my relationship to the brand plays into my **self-image** and **self-esteem**.
* How much **I feel a sense of belonging** and **kinship** with others who use the brand. 
* How much the brand facilitates **communicating who I am**
* How much the content shared by/about the brand **engages me**
* How much the brand helps me forge **new social connections** or **relationships**
* How much other people help me **discover evaluate** and **make** decisions about the brands.
* How much my engagement with the brand or its customers **enhances the value** I get from the brand.

RESULTS AND OUTCOMES
* The top ten brands in social currency were Nike, Subway, Olive Garden, Southwest Airlines, Honda, Levi's, Wendy's Under Armour, Chili's, and Toyota. Nike scored an indexed social currency composite of 119--a weighted composite of the brand's results on the seven dimensions. The score are interpreted to mean that Nike provides social currency benefits at a 19% higher rate than the average of the other 90 brands included in the study.

* The results suggest brands can use social media engagement with customers to build the relationship--conversing, sharing, caring, and interacting in each other's lives over time (Just like people do). We'll take a deep look at how brands can engage consumers using social community (zone 1) in Chapter 6.

## PULLING IT ALL TOEGETHER
* Marketers use these bases of segmentation to construct **buyer personas**. A persona is a snapshot of your ideal customer that tells a story using the information you used for segmentation (i.e., demographic, geographic, psychographic, benefits sought, and behaviour). This "bio" provides a composte sketch of the desired target market. With personas, marketers are better able  to identify, understand, acquire, engage, and retain the target audience. For example, Geckoboard, a company offering data visualization software for social media analytics, describes its buyer personas as a young to middle aged founder or chief executive-level decision-maker, at an organization in a high-growth, digital business with 11-200 employees, located in the United States, Western Europe, Australia, or Canada. Figure 2.2 provides an example of a persona.

                FIGURE 2.2 Buyer Personas
                * Who is he: 
                        * CEO of large financial firm worth $100 million; 
                        * Has been in role for 5 years
                        * **He is an innovative and a risk taker**
                        * He likes to communicate via email, face to face or by phone
                        * He is on LInkedin and Twitter
                        * He reads financial and economic news source online
                        * He likes to attend financial conferences
                * How he finds vendors
                        * He trusts referals and word of mouth
                        * He goes to the webiste during the initial phase of his buying journey
                        * He is not interested in using the information on the website beyond initial research. He prefers to weight his options before making any buying decisions.
                * Pain points:
                        * There are eight people involved in the purchase decision for his financial firm
                        * He is looking for a competitive price, with strong team experience and a track record of good creative work.
                        * The size of the team representing him is important. He always wants in-market representative, to allow for easier communication flows.
                * What he wants to know:
                        * Expertise
                        * Case studies
                        * Example of work
                        * Awards
                        * References
                        * Strong partnership
                * What he doesn't want
                        * He doesn't want to pay large fees, or be lokced in a long-term contract. Vlaue for money is important, as is his ability to change direction if needed.
                * Why he buys from us:
                        * Price and team expertise
                * How we retain him
                        * He is very hands-on and likes open lines of communication. Respond to a change requests quickly
                        * Monthly recaps
                        * Pitch new, out of the box ideas.
                        * Share latest industry news and best practices

* Marketers also use the segmentation bases and variables for targeting social media audiences. For marketers using Facebook, the following bases and variables can be sued to target posts and ads:

                * Demographics: Facebook offers many demographic targeting options, including age, sex, income, marital status
                * Location: you can target users by state, locality, zip code, and country
                * Psychographics: Facebook enables targeting by interests
                * Behaviour: Behaviour use the Facebook Pixel to target users. Pixel is a piece of code that tracks user behaviour so that you can display ads to people that behave in certain ways. For example, you might show ads to people who subscribe to your blog. It is also possible to target on engagement such as when someone comments, "likes" or follows you on social media.

## SOCIAL IDENTITY
* Facebook? Youtube? Flickr? Twitter? Which of these sites do you make a part of your digital life? What are you sharing? Thoughts, opinions, activities, photos, videos? When and from where? On the go with a mobile device? From a fixed location using a stationary computer? These days, the answer is most or all of the above. We all have an image of ourselves, or a sense of who we are; this is called our **self-concept**. From a psychoological perspective, **social identity** is the part of our self-concept that results from our perceived memebership in a group. We can break this rather abstract-sounding notion into two components. First, we think of ourselves as members of some groups but not others. At any point in time, what we're doing and where we are brings one of our groups front of mind. When playing a video game, for instance, we might see ourselves as a member of an affinity group of gamers. We probably won't be identifying with people who like baking. Second, we belong to many, many groups--some formal, some informal; some aspirational, some actual. If we are aware of our membership and the group is important to us, it can affect our social identity. What does this have to do with social media? When we participate in social media, we are engaging with one or more groups. From the broadest view, posting on Instagram is an interaction with the group of Instagram users.
* Our online activities and the information we post document and express our social identity--the way we represent ourselves via our social connections, community memebership, participation, and shared text, images, sounds, and video--to others who access the web. Consequently, social identity can influence where, when, how and what you contribute as a social media participant.
* **Marketers are interested in your social identity--along with other information useful for segmenting and targeting you, like your demographic characteristics, your interests, and lifestyle, your personality traits, where you live and work, your shopping behaviours offline and online, and so on. Where do they get this data? From a host of sources--smart marketers will license data from multiple sources to build a dataset useful for marketing analytics.** One of the sources is social data. As you participate online, you leave behind residue, sometimes calleed social exhaust. The residue becomes a source of **big social data**, data generated from technology-mediated social interactions and actions online, which can be collected and analyzed. When marketers assess this information, the portrait they paint of you is their view of your social identity. Altimeter defines the marketers' view of social identity as "the information about an individual available in social media, including profile data and ongoing activity". In other words, social identity is the way marketers view you given your social media activities.
* Just as direct marketers have long known that a more complete customer profile can lead to better targeting of offers, marketers now recognize the utilizing social data can further enrich these profiles. Marketers can use this information to identify new leads, convert prospects to customers, resolve service issues, and more. For example, if a brand can associate an Instagram user who posts a picture with a complaint caption with a customer who has purchased often in the past, it can resolve the complaint, retain the customer, and build high customer lifetime value. Altimeter belives using social identity data helps brands to build richer customer profiles, efficiently use marketing budgets, and engage across channels. Brands can use social identity data at all points in the purchase funnel, whether they seek to identify prospects, nurture leads, tailor recommmendations, follow up with customers to enhance retention, or reward loyalty.

## SOCIAL TOUCHPOINTS: THE DNA OF SOCIAL IDENTITY
* Let's take a closer look. Perhaps in a typical day you wake up using an alarm clock app on your smartphone. After you snooze the alarm, you might check your news feeds on Facebook Mobile. You leave home and head for school. In transit, you stay connected with your smartphone or even an Internet-enabled car if you drive a new Ford. You might search for reviews on the best place for coffee along your route, or the cheapest source of gas. When you get to class, your professor might ask you to work collaboratively in a wiki on a class assignment or bookmark research for a group project using an app lik Evernote. Later that night, you might watch The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. you get ready for your evening shift at work. When Jimmy tweets out the hashtag for tonight's Hashtag Games, you turn to Twitter to play along, hoping to be among those chosen to be on the show. See what we mean? Everywhere you go, as long as you have an Internet-enabled device, social media can be a part of your daily life. The opportunities exist as **social media touchpoints**. You can see the possibilities for these touchpoints in Figure 2.3. These touchpoints leave impressions, and they make up the data that marketers use to paint your social identity.

                Skip Figure 2.3

## SOCIAL FOOTPRINTS
* A footprint is the impression on mark on an object makes when it occupies a physical space. Depending upon the surface material, the impression may remain sometime after the indention was created--when a budding graffiti artist happens upon a patch of drying cement, the rest is history! Similarly, a **social footprint** is the mark a person makes when he or she is present in a social media space. As we visit websites and web communities, we leave a digital trail behind. This social footrpint may be subtle or obvious depending upon the quantity and frequency of visits and the activities in which we participate. For example, when you visit your friend's Facebook profile and learn that she's a fan of Juicy Couture, you learn something about what matters to her. This information is one aspect of her social footprint. 
* Like Hansel and Gretel who dropped breadcrumbs to mark their way in the forest, you leave traces as you interact online and especially as you share social content. Have you ever "liked" a site, an article, or a product? Footprints. Did you ever shop online? More footprints. Comment on Youtube videos? Download podcasts from iTunes or upload pictures on Instagram? That's right... more footprints. Records of your activities may make up a **lifestream** (assuming you share detail with regularity), which is essentially a diary you keep through your social media acitivities.
* Your footprints become a source of the big social data (we'll cover how marketers use the data in Chapter 10). The footprints are useful for making predictions about people--even broad, seemingly innocuous measures, such as the number of times you've logged into Facebook, and number of "likes", comments, and shares. According to Michal Kosinki, a Stanfrod-based researcher who coordinated a collaborative research study of the Facebook footprints of 8 million volunteers, social footprints can effectively predict surprisingly personal traits--including whether your parents are divorced.

## YOUR SOCIAL BRAND
* Your deposit social footprints throughout the social communities you visit. Many socila communities require registration as a member of the community in order to access services and join in community activities. Lacking visible bodies, people actively construct profiles that reflect how they want to be identified in social media spaces. Your username in social communities is a handle or nickname, just like those tuck drivers used on their old-fashioned CB radios. It may be a psyudonym of your real name. Although many digital natives use pseudonyms that can hide real identities and maintain some privacy, others choose handles that describe something about them in shorthand as they try to build a following. We can  think of these IDs as our digital brand name. Rather than hide one's identity,  they heighten the meaning associated with one's name. For example, digital media guru Jennifer Leggio, a prominent blogger for ZDNet, uses the handle "mediaphyer" to represent her social digital footprint.
* Before settling on a handle, be sure that you aren't handle-squatting. This term refers to the use of a digital brand name by someone who really doesn't have a claim to the brand name. Sometimes another person may have a legitimate claim to the name--many of us have names that are not unique. For instance, there are hundreds of men named David Jones in the world. In that case, use of the handle doesn't constitue squatting. On the other hand, a quick search of Twitter fo actor Hugh Jackman turns up several people listings, including @RealHughJackman, @jackmanHugh, @HughJackman, and @H_Jackman, among others. Only one is the "real" Hugh Jackman--the others are probably handle-squatters.
* Next, you should find out whether your desired username is available in the many social communities. Services like Namechk.com make this easy. A sign of the times--parents are using services like this to choose baby names (to find a unique name) and then registering their newborns in social networks to reserve the handle!

### YOUR SOCIAL BRAND IN THE AGE OF SELFIES
* The first selfie was shared in early 2011, and in just a few years the hashtag #selfie has been used on Instagram more than 185 million times. That's just one social vehicle and one hashtag. People use the hashtag #me just as much! A hashtag is a word or phrase comprised of letters, numbers, and/or emojip receded by what was once referred to as the pound symbol (#). Your selfies are indicators of your social brand and, like your handle, they differ from many other sources of information that make up your social identity. Aspects of your identity over which you have a great deal of control are thought to be active, while activities associated with typical participation in social channels are thought to be more passive. The less control you have over the information, the more passive it is in terms of influencing your identity. A selfie is one of the most active aspects because you are in control. You may take several shots, but you publish only the ones you like--if you publish it all.
* We'll explain later in this chapter how marketers can use the information that makes up your social identity to target you more effectively, but what does your social identity say to others? To your friends, family, employers, teachers? That's the question Andy Beal addresses in Repped, a book designed to show people how to protect their own reputations in a social economy. Why is it important? Because, as we discussed in Chapter 1, social media are a reputation economy. Brian Solis perhaps said it best: "Think about it this way. When you look in the mirror, you see a reflection of who you are right now. What if you could transform that reflection each day into someone you hoped to see staring back at you?" You can with the choices you make. Solis suggests that people conduct their own social activity audit. Sounds like a useful activity? It should. It's a personal version of a **social media audit**, the exercise marketers use to assess the situation and their competitors' social presence! A personal audit should categorize social media activity according to the values expressed in the social engagement:

                * Vision: a vision post answers the questions: "Did I learn something? Was I inspired?"
                * Validation: a validation activity answers the question, "Am I accepted by a group?"
                * Vindication: a vindication post informs others, "I am right."
                * Vulnerability: a vulnerability post opens one's self to others, "I am approachable."
                * Vanity: a vanity post reveals a tendent to narcissism, "Look at me. I am all that".

* Footprints should reveal a social identity that is balanced. We all have aspects of these avlues inside. But when our footprints are focused more in certain areas, we may inadvertently paint a distored picture of ourselves.
* Once you've completed the audit, you will be ready to cultivate a personal brand identity using social media. Daniel Tolliday of  the Social media Examiner poses five questions--the answers will guide your choices as you build your social brand:

                * What goal are you seeking to accomplish?
                * What do you want to be known for?
                * What groups and people are active in your desired field and which social media channels do they use?
                * What can you do to communicate your desired social brand identity while also differentiate yourself from others?
                * What visual elements will support the image you want to accomplish?

* Who knows! You could become the next "it" social media influencer. That's one of the exciting benefits of social media. Anyone with a unique point of view can gain a following.
* To summarize, your social footprint leaves evidence of where you are and where you've been. Your lifestream is the journal of your digital life. Taken together, they make up your social brand, what marketers call your social identity. When you look at this evidence, we think you'll agree: youare what you share.

### CRITICAL REFLECTION
WHICH RIGHT MATTERS MOST? THE RIGHT TO KNOW OR THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY?
* We've warned that reputation is everlasting in the realm of social media. But is that really so? The Court of Justice of the European Union thinks differently. Under Data Protection Directive, its so-called Right to be Forgotten ruling, the Court declared that people have a right to control, at least to some extent, the access others have to digital information about them. In other words, if you don't like some of the information that makes up your social identity, just ask Google that it not be found! And yes, your public activities in social communities are indexed! Try Googling yourself to see what others could see. While you may appreciate this "do-over" approach to burying past mistakes, it creates tension between the right to privacy and that of free speech. Japan's top court recently ruled on a right to be forgotten case and determined that the country's legal system prioritizes the public's right to know over privacy. Denying a plaintiff's bid to remove search results on Google about his child pornography-related criminal record, the high court said that search engines assist users in obtaining necessary information from massive volumes of data and, therefore, play pivotal roles in modern society's Internet-based information distribution. The court listed six factors to guide society's Internet-based information distribution. The court listed six factors to guide future cases in determining which should be suspended--freedom of speech or privacy:

                1. nature and content of information resulting from search engine search
                2. plaintiff's damage
                3. plaintiff's social status and power
                4. searched articles' objective and meaning
                5. societal conditions
                6. necessity of posting searched information
                
===

* Google recently won a landmark case in which the EU's top court ruled that Google does not have to remove links globally--only in Europe. Thus, even those who have the right to be forgotten are faced with some geographical limitation.

### EXHIBIT 2.2
COMPANIES USE SELFIE TOO!
* GT's Living Foods, the leading brand of kombucha, is just one of several brands, like Toyota, Mastercard, Disney, and Tarte Cosmetics, leveraging the popularity of selfies in marketing campaigns. GT's decided to use the #selfie trend to inspire kombucha fans to submit user-generated content. The brand released a video encouragin viewers to post selfies with a GT's Kombucha bottle and the hashtag #infullbloom. For each selfie, the brand donated $5 to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. The connection to a charity enabled GT's to leverage the altruism motive to participate in social media and the selfie appealed to the validation impulse.

## MOTIVES AND ATTITUDES INFLUENCING SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES
* Web users increasingly participate in social networks such as Facebook, play online social games (turn-based, multi-player games designed to be played within social networks) such as Candy Crush within the network community, watch videos, listen to music, comment on the posts of friends, update status messages, and share content. Likewise, brands are active on these sites as they add content and try to converse with consumers. Research from GfK identified the top social activities:

                * visiting a friend's profile page
                * commenting on a friend's post
                * sending a private message
                * watching a video
                * posting pictures
                * linking a post
                * updating status
                * follwing, liking, or becoming a fan of somet hign or someone
                * playing a social game
        
* **For marketers, understanding the motives for social media participation can facilitate the design of effective social media marketing campaigns. What motives are behind participation in social media? Chances are there are many reasons that drive your activity in social communities. Some of these motives probably seem like no-brainers, but others may surprise you. These are the most common impulses researchers have identified:

* **Affinity impulse**: social networks enable participants to express an affinity, to acknowledge a liking and/or relationship with individuals and reference groups. Affinity relates to the affective dimension of social identity. When you use Facebook to stay in touch with high school friends and to make new friends, you are responding to the affinity impulse. This is also referred to as a social function. When people contribute to social communities for this reason, they do so to form friendships and feel a sense of belonging. The affinity impulse is related to a person's desire for social capital. **Social capital** refers to the resources created by the **building and maintaining of relationships in social networks.**
* **Personal utility impulse**: While we tend to think of social media participation truly as community participation, some do consider, "What's in it for me?" This is the personal utility impulse and it may be one of the most important motives for brands to acknowledge. Studies of participation in social communities report that utility, whether in the form of information seeking, incentive seeking, entertainment seeking, or convenience seeking, is a major motive for social media activity. The findings are congruent with others utilizing a uses and gratification approach to understanding social media behaviour. For instance, one study found 60% of Internet suers used social media as a source of health-related information. Participants consulted online reviews of doctors, hospitals, and medical treatments; posted reviews of their own experiences; and posted questions in social networks
* **Contact comfort** and **immediacy impulse**: people have a natural drive to feel a sense of psychological closeness to others. Contact comfort is the sene of relief we feel from knowing others in our network are accessible. Immediacy also lends a sense of relief in that the contact is without delay. Do you feel lost without your mobile phone? Do you feel anxious if you haven't checked Facebook recently? When you rely to a message, do you keep checking for a response? These are indicators of your need for contact comfort and **contact immediacy**. Social media users even seek contact comfort and immediacy from brands. One study found that nearly 40% of respondents believed brands were very likely to engage with them on social networks and 25% expected a response within an hour of leaving a comment on a brand's Facebook or Twitter page. In another study, participants named timeliness and speed of response and sense of connection among the attributes they associate with the most successful brands using social media.
* **Altruistic impulse**: some participate in social media as a way to do something good. They use social media to "make the world a better place", and "pay it forward". The altruistic impulse is also aided by the immediacy of social media, and this value has been played out in the **immediate altruistic response** of social media suers to aid calls during crises such as the earthquake relief for Haiti or Japan. Individuals want to do good an do it quickly--social media make it easier to contribute in the form of a cash donation or a service to the community. The altruistic impulse serves a value-expressive function in that it enables individuals to express their own moral beliefs through their social media behaviour. Altruism can also explain negatively valenced social media activities including **altruistic punishment**, in which social media users seek to draw attention to a company or person whose behaviour is unacceptable to the social community. Beware of the difference between the altruistic impulse and affinity and validation impulses. Known as **virtue signaling** (and sometimes "hashtag activism" or "slacktivism"), people may give token support for a cause with a simple post-share or like. The altruistic impulse is intrinsically motivated. If the underlying motive is to affirm a relationship, publicity build one's image, or shame others, altruism is not the social media motive at play.
* **Curiosity impulse**: When people use social media to gain new knowledge and stimulate intellectual interests, **epistemic curiosity** is the driver. Another form of curiosity is the **pruient impulse**. Online, we can satisfy our curiosity by "following" people on Twitter and visiting their profiles. Surely it is the pruient impulse that led millions of Twitter users to follow Kim Kardashian's daily tweets, while millions of other relentlessly tract the ups-and-downs of Justin Bieber--will he prevail, or crash and burn?
* **Validation impulse**: social media focus intently on the individual. You can share many or as few of your opinions and activities as you like, and comment on those of others. This focus on the self highlights the validation impulse, in other words, feeding one's own ego. That's why the validation impulse is sometimes referred to as the ego-defensive function. This function is thought to be particularly relevant as people seek to eliminate perceived external threats and eliminate self-doubts. Certain behaviours are affiliated with people driven by the validation impulse. These include the prevalence of selfies among the mix of posts, a tendency to check to seek whether posts received "likes", a tendency to overshare, and a tendency to impression manage (e.g., promoting the perfect life). These were among the behaviours noted by researchers in a study that investigated types of narcissism in social media. Particularly on Facebook and Twitter, people may use posts to show superiority (particularly by expressing opinions) or to participate in exhibitionism. That's why Brian Solis, a thought leader in the realm of social media, advises to guard against the dreaded disease "accidental narcissm". Perhaps it's no wonder then that an analysis of Twitter posts found that 80% were posted by "meformers" and just 20% by informers. Meformers post updates primarily related to themselves such as commentary on their daily mood and acitivites, while informers post updates that share and/or link to information. Though informers were less prevalent, the study revealed that they have twice the number of followers as meformers.

* Though all of these motives have been linked to social media participation, one study suggested tht the validation motive, and especially the aspect related to developing a desirable image, is the dominant driver of social media activities. Whether a conscious decision or not, image management is a major factor in social media participation. Particularly when one is narrowcasting (i.e. communicating with just one person) rather than braodcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people), people will avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. How can we know whether our friends are revealing their "true selves" to us online? The answer may be in the content--a study of true self-expression on Facebook found that people who felt comfortable sharing their "true self" tended to post personally revealing and emotional content. Earlier we encouraged you to audit your social media activities and to consider using social media to brand yourself. As part of the exercise, you may want to consider how mcuh separation between personal friends and professional colleagues you prefer and whether you will use social media as a tool for enhancing your professional reputation. The choices you make will result in one of four strategies to guide the boundaries you set between personal and professional contacts while accomplishing your goal. Figure 2.4 illustrates the four strategies and includes recommendations to guide your social media activity.

                FIGURE 2.4: A Framework for Understanding Social Sharing Boundaries
                Self-verification, Integration: 
                        Open boundary management behaviour: Open your profiles to personal and professional contacts
                
                Self-verification, Separation: 
                        Audience boundary management behaviours: Exclude professional contacts from your social media profiles

                Self-enhancing, Integration:

## PRIVACY SALIENCE: HOW MUCH DO THEY KNOW AND HOW MUCH DO YOU CARE?
* It's helpful for marketers to understand motives for social media participation and sharing as we make strategic marketing decisions, but the residue left behind from your social footprints is also of value. That residue of big social data makes up the social identity information that marketers can use to augment other customer information, conduct research, target advertising and other promotions, and more.
* Are you concerned about privacy as it relates to your social media activities? The extent to which one worries about privacy and the risks related to the collection, unauthorized secondary use, errors in, and improper access of personal data is known as privacy salience. Interestingly, privacy salience doesn't necessarily explain whether social media users take steps to protect their privacy. Because of this disparate relationship, researchers call the phenomenon the **privacy paradox**. The privacy paradox describes people's willingness to disclose personal information in social media channels despite expressing high levels of concern for privacy concerns as a two-part systems: System 1 is **intuitive concern** and System 2 is **considered concern**. Intuitive concern is an emotional gut reaction to a possible privacy invasion, while considered concerned is an emotional gut reaction to a possible privacy invasion, while considered concern involves identifying possible privacy risks, estimating the potential costs of privacy invasions, and deciding whether any benefits offset those costs. Thus, it is possible for social media users to have high intuitive concern and yet determine that the risk doesn't warrant action.
* Privacy concerns also take on multiple forms, including social privacy and institutional privacy. Social privacy refers to concerns about disclosing personal information to others. Institutional privacy is privacy relating to the use of data by the institution providing the service and third parties. Research suggests that people are taking steps to protect their social privacy. Common strategies include using privacy settings to restrict access, excluding personal contact information, untagging and removing photographs, and limiting contact to known others. While it's still common to disclose (and perhaps overshare) intimate information, people may feel comfortable sharing because they've taken steps to protect social privacy.
* Some suggest that privacy is viewed differerntly by differernt generations. In particular, today's teens exhibit lower levels of privacy salience. According to Pew, teens share a lot of information in social channels:

                * 92% have posted their real name to the profiles they use
                * 91% have posted a selfie.
                * 82% have posted their birth date
                * 71% have posted the name of the school they currently attend
                * 71% have posted the name of the town in which they live.
                * 64% who use Twitter have a public profile
                * 53% have posted their email address
                * 20% have psoted their mobile phone number
                * 16% have allowed sites to auto-post their location.

* Why so much sharing? It may be the view of the social context. If social media communities are viewed as private, the expectation is the social norms will prevent inappropriate use of the content and people should feel comfortable disclosing sensitive information. If these spaces are viewed as public rather than private communities, users may disclose more carefully, recognizing that the content may have a broad reach beyond the intended audience. People, particularly young people, may view social media profiles as forms of "produced self" and tend to see social communities as public venues. In other words, people may view privacy in social media settings as networked privacy. With **networked privacy**, people understand that their personal information is likely to be compromised by technological and social violations and that any protective behaviours they may invoke are likely to be insufficient. People may develop an attitude of "privacy cynicism" as a copying mechanism, leading to a resigned neglect of behaviours that would protect privacy. Another explanation is that social media users use a mental cost-benefit approach to justify negating their privacy concerns when trust is high, marginal risk is low, and the entities collecting the data aren't overtly present.
* Privacy salience may also vary by cultural region. A study by marketing research firm Ipsos found just that! you might be surprised by the outcome, though. When asked for a descriptor of how much they share online, one in four people around the world said they share everything. The United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany all under indexed while countries such as Saudi Arabia over indexed. There may be a relationship between Internet penetration and oversharing. Nearly all of the countries reporting oversharing are in areas with lower Internet penetration, while the countries that undershare primarily European, where Internet penetration is high.

## SOCIAL MEDIA SEGMENTS
* Because social media are such new areas, marketers are still figuring out just how to use them, and to what extent they should rely on these platforms when they identify their target markets and try to communicate with them. One brand may add a social media piece to a broader strategy when it creates a Facebook page, whereas another may replace virutally all of its traditional advertising with "new media" messages. Decisions regarding just how much to rely on social media and how to design programs that will be effective require us to understand as much as we can about just who participate in social media and how they may differ from one another.
* Understanding these nuances will help you to ensure that the social media marketing strategies and tactics you plan have a shot to resonate with the target market. There are countless examples of social media marketing campaigns that have failed. In fact, Gartner, a research firm specializing in technology, claims that half--that's right, 50%--of social media campaigns fail. Why the huge number of bombs? Probably a major reason is simply that the social strategy is not matched to the target audience. A contest that requires players to upload original content will not succeed with a target market that primarily consumers content but does not create its own. A promotion for a free song download offered on Twitter will not work if the band's fans tend to hang out on SoundCloud instead. A stunt from Skittles to feed live streams from social media communities to its website will not appeal to parents if the live feed includes profanity inappropriate for their children. Let's take a look at several social segementation models, each of which offers insights about social media users.

## SOCIAL TECHNOGRAPHICS
* Forrester Research introduced the concept of **Social Technographics** based on research if conducted on the social and digital lives of consumers. This work became the foundation for a book, Groundswell, by Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff (2008). From that first study, Forrester identified six types of people (of those online) based on how those people use and interact with social media. **Categories included joiners, creators, critics, collectors, and conversationalists.** The types were not exclusive--some people fit into more than one category based on their activities. The behaviours are still useful, but as the population of social media users became increasingly savvy and engaged, Forrester revised the model to incorporate an overall score of social media usage. The new framework emphasizes that people rely on social media at varying degrees throughout the stages of purchase decisions.
* The Social Technographics score reflects how actively a segment uses social tools, how important those tools are within the stages of the consumer life cycle, and how willingly they engage with brands in social media. The score ranges from 0 to 100 and includes four types of social media users: 1) social skippers, 2) social snackers, 3) social savvies, and 4) social stars.

* **Social stars** (scores of 60+) demand social interactions with your company. These consumers constantly use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products. For stars, social media are the preferred choice for interaction with and about brands and products. What's more, with their high discretionary spending via multiple channels, including mobile, social stars are valuable customers to acquire.
* **Social savvies** (scores of 30 to 59) expect social interactions with your company. Social media are still a part of their everyday lives and  they frequently use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products.
* **Social snackers** (scores of 10 to 29) appreciate social interactions with your company. They don't shy away from branded social interactions, but neither do they seek them out--meaning that marketers targeting this audience should treat social tools as a secondary part of their marketing plans.
* **Social skippers** (scores of 0 to 9) spurn social interactions with your company. They rarely use social media to connect with companies, brands, and products. Skippers prefer to interact with companies through established channels such as email, catalogs, and brick-and-mortar stores--so marketers targeting this audience should put as few resources as possible into their social efforts. You may be surprised to learn that skippers constitute more than 20% of the general population, but don't worry. Skippers tend to be older, brand-switchers who spend the least on discretionary products, and resistant to marketing.

* As you might expect given variations in social media usage globally, Social Technographics scores also vary. For instance, in Asia, Indian and Chinese consumers living in metropolitan areas have the highest scores. Though South Korea is typically described as a ountry with heavy social media penetration and usage, Koreans has a lower average Social Technographics score. This is attributed to the popularity of the mobile message app KaKaoTalk.
* Social Technographics also provides scores by customer life cycle stage, to enable brands better choose objectives for social media marketing. Figure 2.5 illustrates a sample report based on the average scroes for online adults in the US.

* The **discover** socre measures the extent to which the target audience uses social media to learn about new brands as well as how likely they are to spread the word about their favorite products and services. High discover scores also reflect an openness to the experiences affored via social media. When marketing to a segment with high discover scores, the zones of social community, social publishing, and social entertainment are all viable.
* The **explore** score gauges whether social media can be used to create purchase intent. This number measures how actively your audience consumes social content when they're considering products and making purchase decisions. High explore scores suggest social media marketing tactics focused in Zone 2 and 4--the zones of social publishing and social commerce.
* The **buy** score tracks whether social media are likely to be used to make purchases. it measures how often your audience clicks a "buy" button on social sites. In other words, it measures the likelihood of conversation using social media, the ultimate goal of the zone of social commerce. Forrester's research suggest that even peopel who are social stars are still resistent to completing transaction in social media.
* The **use** score measures whether social media can stimulate increasd product usage. It measures how common it is for a target segment to share product and service experiences, such as sharing what songs they're listening to on Spotify or comparing their workouts to that of other Fitbit users. When use scores are high, brands can benefit from organic word-of-mouth communication and encourage the audience to contribute brand-related UGC and reviews and ratings--levaraging the zones of social community, social publishing, and social commerce.
* The **ask** score reflects whether social media are a valued channel for customer support. It measures how commonly the segment turns to social media for help using the proudcts and services they buy, such as asking for help on Twitter or looking up how-to videos on youtube. When ask scores are high, the zones of social community, social publishing, and social commerce are useful.
* The **engage** score gauges whether social media will be useful to build custoemr relationships. It measures the target segment's use of social media to connect with their favorite brands (i.e., their lovemarks). High engage scores suggest social media marketing strategies that include the zone of social community.

## THE SOCIAL CONSUMPTION/CREATION MATRIX
* Another segmentation framework, the Social Consumption/Creation Matrix, categorizes social media user types according to their degree of social media consumption and creation. While a more simplistic representation of social media users, the framework effectively captures the dual roles of creation and consumption. Consumption of social media content is the most prevalent activity but must be served by the more taxing creation of content. While brands and media publish social media content, research suggests that social media users have a proclivity for content created by other users. Considering user propensity, from low to high, for content creation and consumption reulsts in a four-segment matrix, depicted in Figure 2.6. 1) attention seekers, 2) devoteees, 3) entertainment chasers, and 4) connection seekers.

                FIGURE 2.6: The Social Consumption/Creation Matrix
                Suggested Tactics by User Type

                Creation:low; Consumption: low:
                        Entertainment Chasers: Advergaming, Contests, Quizzes

                Creation: High; Consumption: Low:
                        Attention Seekers: "Celebrity" Endorsers

                Creation: Low; Consumption: High
                        Connection Seekers: Groups, Events

                Creation High; Consumption: High:
                        Devotees:Brand ambassadors, UGC generators.

* **Attention seekers** have large networks, high social capital, and the ability to create and promote social content. These are the social media influencers we discussed earlier in the chapter--regular people whose social media activities have created a celebrity-like following for them. They are motivated by validation impulse and are ready to participate in conspicuous, brand-initiated interaction.
* **Devotees** are ideal brand ambassadors, because they want to interact with brands and are eager to share their opinions. Like attention seekers, they are talented content creators, but because devotees are also active content consumers, other social media users may perceive them as more authentic and genuine.
* **Entertainment chasers** are characterized by a low level of both creation and consumption. These are passive users with short attention spans who restrict their investments of time and effort unless there is a reward offered as an incentive. They respond best to social media marketing efforts in the zone of social entertainment, including videos, quizzes, pools, and games.
* **Connection seekers** are the largest segment of social media participants. They make up the foundation of any social community. Though they are low content creators, their ongoing engagement is critical to the health of social communities. Motivated by the affinity impulse, connection seekers want to socialize and build relationships. For brands, the social media marketing activities associated with teh zone of social community wil be most effective for nurturing connection seekers.

* The Social Consumption/Creation Matrix provides clear guidance to marketers given the characteristics of each segment. The framework is based on research conducted among Facebook users, but clearly the implications are valuable across social channels.

## A TYPOLOGY OF SOCIAL UTILITY
* Researchers from Ryerson University in Toronto took a different approach to categorizing social media segemnts, employing user propensity to socialize and seek information in social media communities. By categorizing social media users into **passive or active information seekers and passive or active participants, four segments were identified, as shown in Figure 2.7; 1) Minimalists, 2) Info seekers, 3) Socializers, and 4) Mavens.** Brands must interact socially in the zone of social community to target Socializers and Mavens, and actively provide content (content marketing in the zone of social publishing) for Info Seekers and Mavens. Minimalists are the least engaged, presumably because thir needs for affiliation and information are lower than those of the other segments.

## MICROBLOG USER TYPES
* Microblogs like Twitter are thought to differ from other social networks. Members may seek to align by interests rather than relationships. The patterns go even deeper though, as Pew Research Center found in its study of Twitter topic networks. It discovered six specific archetypes of social media participation in its analysis of Twitter conversation:

1. Polarized crowds
2. Tight crowds
3. Brand clusters
4. Community clusters
5. Broadcast networks
6. Support networks

* The two most critical for marketers are brand clusters and support networks, but before we get into that, let's take a look at the meaning of each archetype. Polarized crowds are people who are passionately discussing an issue. There are two sides and people do not cross the party lines. Tight crowds are characterized by high interconnected people such as hobbyists, fans, or pofessional groups. Brand clusters are talking about brands but the people talking are not talking with each other. Community clusters typically feature news relevant to specific groups. Broadcast networks exist when many people repeat prominent news. The news sources are the hub, but the news is spread through retweets. The support network is one in which customer compaints are handled by one or more members. It produces a hub-and-spoke structure but the numbers are larged disconnected. Brand clusters are relevant for social media marketers because these conversations are occuring around brand topics. There is an opportunity to engage. The support network archetype is relevant to brand seeking to use social media as a customer service channel.

### CASE STUDY
221BC's SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING
* In Chapter 1, we met 221BC and its owners, Aneta and Eric Lundquist, 221BC is a family-owned company offering a high-quality kombucha with unique flavors. The company is committed to developing a social media marketing strategy to facilitate accomplishing several marketing objectives. In this chapter, we take a closer look at 221BC's target audience.
* Given the many health benefits of kombucha, it may seem like it should target a mass market. Everyone wants to healthier, right? While that's tempting, marketers know that marketing is most effective when we strategically design marketing, efforts to meet the needs and characterisitics of specific target markets. In Chapter 2, we learned the bases of segmentation used to group the marketing population into segments, from which we can choose target markets. Personas are developed to provide further insight into the motivations, behavioural patterns, and characteristics of the target markets. We also learned about motivations and behavioural patterns affecting social media participation, which can be useful when planning social media marketing campaigns.
* 221BC will want to target existing drinkers of kombucha and may also want to target non-drinkers who are likely to embrace kombucha once they try it and know its health benefits. So who drinks kombucha? Millennials have embraced kombucha. One study found that 51% of those between the ages of 25 and 34 drink kombucha, but other estimates suggest only 14% of the US population has tried kombucha. Another found that kombucha consumers are typically concerned with buying local and sustainably produced products, even more so than they are concerned with cost. They choose kombucha for its probiotics, flavor, and taste. Even though kombucha drinkers re driven by its health nenefits, they tend to prioritize convenience and accessbility over local, fresh brews. They are open to trying new things and pay attention to health trends. Kombucha drinkers also tend to have a healthy lifestyle with interests in sustainability and social good and fitness activities like yoga.
* Women make up the prime demographic target audience for the global kombucha market. This is connected to a rise in health consciousness as well as increased spending power for women around the world. Women today tend to focused on fitness, healthy eating, and weight loss and this has all contributed to increased sales of kombucha and the overall strength of the kombucha market.
* 221BC has created some elements of a target person which it calls The Conscious Foodie, described in Figure 2.8. In terms of demographics, this market is between the ages of 18 and 54 (with a sweet spot of 30-54), college-educated, and middle- to upper-class income. Psychographically, the target market is active in outdoor sports, a heavy user of digital and social media, strives for a healthy lifestyle, appreciates good design, and is willing to pay more for quality. She likes to try new experiences and she' curious and open to different cultures. 221BC's geographic market is currently limited to Florida Eand other major city markets but it is planning expansion in the near future. The benefits sought include an alternative to sodas, an alternative to alcoholic beverages, a beverage that provides energy detox, and healthy probiotics.

                The conscious foodie
                        * Demographics: Female, may have children, 18-54, College educated, upper middle class
                        * Psychographics: Active and enjoy the outdoors, digitally connected, strives to live a healthy lifestyle, willing to pay more for quality, appreciate good design

## COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
* Through infrastructure, channels, devuices, and social software make social media possible, it's people like you that make it a living, breathing part of everyday life. Social media are first and foremost about community: the collective participation of members who together create value. Defining exactly what an online community is and what it isn't has been difficult task for researchers. Thwrough different approach exist, we'll refer to online communities as a group of people who come together for a specific purpose, who are guided by community policies, and who are supported by an online vehicle or host that enables virtual communication among members.
* In some ways, online communities are not much different from those we find in our physical environment. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online version, of course) defines community as "a unified body of individuals, unified by interest, location, occupation, common history, or political and economic concerns." In fact, one social scientist refers to an online community as a cyberspace where "people connect online with kindred spirits, engage in supportive and sociable relationships with them, and imbue their activity online with meaning, belonging , and identity".
* Community participation is facilitated online by sites that serve as hosts or vehicles (the second layer of infrastructure in the Social Media Value Chain we covered in Chapter 1) for communication and collaboration between members. These hosts, whether social network sites, forums, or message boards, proide a virtual space--a cyberplace--and functionality to support member connectivity and participation in one or more of the zones of social media. Chances are you are already using Facebook and other host sites like these!

                * Qzone
                * Taringa
                * Sina Weibo
                * VK
                * Youku

* Across all four zones, the value of social media is tied to network effects and group influence. For this reason, we cover the structural elements of networks, the creation and flow of content, and the sources of influence in social communities as a foundation. We'll also explore the rise of influencer marketing.

## NETWORKS: THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF COMMUNITIES
* When we first presented the Social Media Vlaue to you, we emphasize that all of social media are networked. Though we'll talk more in the next chapter (and throughout the text) about social network sites, in fact all social communities are networks of social networks. Social network sites--defined as "networked communication platforms in which participants 1) have uniquely identifiable profiles that consist of user-supplied content, content provided by other users, and/or system-provided data; 2) can publicly articulate connections that can be viewed and traversed by others; and 3) can consume, produce, and/or interact with streams of user-generated content provided by their connections on the site"--serve as the most prevalent form of host in social media. Networks underlie the premise of social media and the network effect is key to understanding the value of social communities for social media marketing. The network effect explains that the relative value a community offers its members is tied to its membership. Before we move on, let's cover the basics of social network theory, the theory that explains how networks (whether online or off) work.

## SOCIAL NETWORKS
* A **social network** is a set of socially relevant nodes connected by one or more relations. Nodes are members of the network (whom we also refer to as network units). When we think of community we tend to think of people, but members of a network can be organizations, articles, countries, departments, or any other definable unit. A good example is your university alumni association. Members are connected by their relationships (or ties) with each other. Relationships are based on various affiliations such as kinship, friendship and affective ties, shared experiences, professional relationships, and shared hobbies and interests. They may be reciprocal or unidirectional. Friend, follower, fan, link, and contact are all terms used to denote relationship connections in social communities.
* Social networks can be diagrammed to illustrate the interconnections of network units. Figure 3.1 illustrates a visual representation of a member's social network showing the nodes, ties, and relationship strength. Circles in the image represent nodes (members of Linkedin) who are connected via ties. Linkedin also supplies information on degrees of separation between members. People with direct connection are separated by one degree. A friend of a friend has a two degree separation, and so on.
* How many degrees of separation are you from your favorite movie star or most admired business leader? Six degrees or less. That's the concept known as the six degrees of separation--the idea that anyone on Earth is connected to anyone else in just six steps or less. So through just five other people or less, you're effectively connected to anyone and everyone--whether those people are the Queen of England, Mark Zuckerberg, or Cristiano Ronaldo. The theory originated from a 1929 short story called "Chains", by Frigyes Karinthy in which one of the characters challenges the others to find another person on Earth that he can not connect himself to through fewer than five intermediaries, but was't tested scientifically until decades later. Based on the math, the concept is plausible. "Assuming everyone konws at least 44 people, and that each of those people knows an entirely new 44 people, and so on, the maths shows that in just six steps everyone could be connected to 44^6, or 7.26 billion people--more than are alive on Earth today". But we owe the real breakthrough in scientific support for the thoery to a college game called "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"
* Connected nodes in a network experience interactions; these are behaviour-based ties such as talking with each other, attending an event together, or working together. If you have a conversation on Twitter, you are a node engaging in an interaction with another node. These interactions create flows among connected nodes.

## FLOW: HOW IDEAS TRAVEL ONLINE
* Flow are exchanges of resources, information, or influence among members of the network. For example, on Facebook you share news, updates about your life, opinions on favorite books and movies, photos, videos, and notes. As you share content, you create flows among those in your network. In social media these flows of communication go in many directions at any point in time and often on multiple platforms--a condition called media multiplexity. Flows are not simply two wayor three way, they may involve an entire community, a list of group within a network, or several individuals independently.
* Flows of communication also occur outside the community platform. While the online community exists within a web space, the flows of communication may extend to other domains such as emails, text messages, virtual worlds, and even face-to-face meetup where members of an online network arrange to meet in a physical location. Increasingly we find that social connections online result in face-to-face connections offline. For marketers, flows are especially important because they are the actionable components of any social network system in terms of the sharing of information, delivery of promotional materials, and sources of social influence. Word-of-mouth communication flows from node to node. Whether the flow changes behavior or attitudes depends on the social influecne of the initiating node. The extent of social influence (where one person's attitudes or behaviour change as a result of others attempts) varies depending upon the power of attractiveness of other nodes. We'll take a deep look at influence and how someone develops it later in the chapter.
* Earlier we saw that social communities are built on networks, and these networks include nodes that are connected by ties through which content and experiences flow. The nodes of influencers are valuable because of the large number of people they can reach with their social power. Understanding what flows occured and how extensively the flows were disseminated thorugh influencers was first based on a framework called the **two-step flow model of influence**. more recent research has tweaked that basic idea; now it suggests that influence can be driven both by influencers and by interactions among those who are easily influenced. These people communicate the information vigorously to one another and also participate in a two-way dialogue with the opinion leader as part of an influence network. These conversations create cascades of information which occur when a piece of information triggers a sequence of interactions (much like an avalanche), as Figure 3.2 shows.
* A message originates at Level 1 and is sent by the influencer to his or her contacts (level 2). The message may travel on from some level 2 contacts to their contacts (Level 3), and so on. With the ease of sharing via social media, the power of the network effect, and the flow of influence, word-of-mouth communication can spread with or without influencers.

## THE VIRAL SPREAD OF SOCIAL CONTENT
* When content, whether a simple opinion, video, or trend, spreads through social networks rapidly, we say that it has gone viral. Viral content may or may not be branded, but it will be content that a large number of people in one or more social communities deemed relevant, valuable, or just plain too bizarre not to share with friends. Those community members then influenced the spread of the content by altering it, sharing it with their own social graphs (for social networks), and participating in word-of-mouth (WOM) communication about the content. 
* When viral content evolves within a social community, it becomes a meme. A meme is a snippet of cultural information that spreads person to person and is adapted until eventually it enters the general consciousness. These snippets may include songs, phrases, ideas, slang words, fashion trends, or shared behaviours. An example of a meme is that of the millions of Baby Yoda images found across social media!
* It's easy to understand how a meme spreads if you use the medical analogy of a virus; memes spread among consumers in a geometric progression, just as a virus starts off small and steadily infects increasing numbers of people until it becomes an epidemic. The leap from person to person occurs as people share and imitate the meme. The memes that survive over time tend to distinctive and memorable. The most enduring ones evoke earlier memes that may relate to legends and well-known stories and tales. For example, the Star Wars movies evoke prior memes that relate to the legend of King Arthur, religion, heroic youth, and 1930s adventure serials.
* Memes have even inspired their own community on Reddit called the Meme Economy , in which memes are discussed using stock market jargon. It ispired a website, where memes were bought, sold, or held like stocks in a stock market. The buy/sell trades served as an indicator of a meme's future spread.

### EXHIBIT 3.2
VIRAL CONTENT INSPIRES MEMES
* A recent example of viral content is the so-called "kombucha girl" whose experience and reaction to drinking kombucha for the first time spread from TikTok to Twitter and Instagram. In the TikTop clip, Brittany Tomlinson tastes kombucha and shares her reactions including curiosity, uncertainty, disgust, enjoyment, consideration, and laughter! The sequence of facial expressions was so relatable, the video swiftly turned into one of the most well-known reaction memes of 2019. Tomlinson told Vulture about her kombucha experience, saying, "Will I try kombucha again? Probably. Will I like it? Probably not. Will I keep drinking it? Yes most likely."

RICKROLLING: A CLASSIC MEME
* Have you ever clicked on an exciting link or potentially explosure news story, only to find yourself watching the 1987 Rick Astley hit "Never Gonna Give You Up?" Then you've been rickrolled, my friend. A classic bait-and-switch scenario, the meme is as popular now as it's ever been. The first rickroll happened in 2007 when visitors to the Youttube Trailer for the vidoe game Grand Theft Auto IV were instead served Astley's video. Youtube got in on the fun itself one April Fool's Day when the site rickrolled every user who viewed a clip on its homepage. Since then million of people have been rickrolled. See Higgin (2014) for some of the best examples (including one by the White House Twitter account)

## WORD OF MOTH (WOM
* When the information sprread via flow is product information shared node-to-node, person-to-person, it is called **word-of-mouth communication**. Despite all of the money marketers pump into lavish ads, WOM is far more powerful: it influences two-thirds of all consumer goods sales. In one survey, 69% of intervewees said they relied on a personal referral at least once over the course of a year to help them choose a restaurant, 36% reported they used referral to decide on computer hardware and software, and 22% got help from friends and associates to decide where to travel. 
* If you think carefully about the content of your own conversations in the course of a normal day, you will probably agree that much of what you discuss with friends, family members, or co-workers is product related; when you compliment someone on her dress and ask her where she bought it, recommend a new restaurant to a friend, or complain to your neighbor about the shoddy treatment you got at the bank, you engage in WOM.
* Marketers have been aware of the power of WOm for many years, instead of sitting back and hoping more aggressive about trying to promote and control it, instead of sitting back and hoping people will like their products enough to talk them up. The ease of sharing WOm vai social media and other digital channels is a key reason. Companies such as BzzAgent, an everyday influencer marketing compnay (www.bzzagent.com), have thousands of online "agents" who try new products and spread the word about those they like. And many sophisticated marketers today also precisely track WOM.

### EXHIBIT 3.4
ENGAGEMENT LABS MEASURES WOM ONLINE AND OFF
* With word-of-mouth conversation driving $6 trillion in annual consumer spending, marketers need to know what people are saying. Online conversations are important, but offline conversations are too. Engagement Labs' TotalSolution combines in-depth social listening with comprehensive offline conversation measurement tools, delivering a TotalSocial scorecard in 17 major industry categories.

===

* According to the report "Hearing the Voice of the Consumer: UGC and the Commence Experience," online word-of-mouth communication is the most preferred source for 90% of shoppers making a purchase. It even outranked search engines and promotional emails and was so valuable for some that they are willing to pay more and wait longer for shipping for products that are organically endorsed by others. Online WOM consistently correlates with sales in empirical studies, but its influence varies. When shared via social media, it tends to be more influential when those exposed to the message believe they are similar to the person sharing the information. In contrast, similarity doesn't seem to play a role in the relative influence of online WOM on ecommerce platforms. It is also more influential when products are novel, rather than well established in the market.
* Keep in mind that word of mouth can be a double-edged sword for marketers. Just as positive WOM can enhance attitudes and sales, negative WOM can harm. Furthermore, consumers weigh **negative word of mouth** more heavily than they do positive comments. According to a study by the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, 90% of unhappy customers will not do business with a company again. Each of these customers is likely to share his or her grievance with at least nine other people, and 13% tell more than 30 people about their negative experience.
* Over time, negative WOm has increased relative to positive WOM such that there is a higher volume of negative messages online. Reach is also potentially high because social media allow users access to many others, even beyond their own network, because of the cascading flow of information--though, research suggests that the valence of WOM shared may depend upon the interpersonal relationship between sender and receiver. When interpersonal closeness is high, negative WOM is more likely to be shared; when low, positive WOM is more likely. The research suggests that the effect is due to high interpersonal closeness activating the goal to protect others, and low interpersonal closeness activating the goal to enhance the self.
* These brand-specific conversations also have value in terms of their media equivalent, known as the **ad equivalency value**. In other words, when brands use paid media, they have an estimate of the value of the advertising in the form of the fees they paid to place the ads. But in social media, most of our promotional value comes from earned and owned media. Therefore, we may try to establish a value and relate that value to the cost of buying equivalent paid media. This is the meaning of ad equivalence value--what would the value of the mention be if it had come through a paid advertising placement rather a volunteered comment?
* Forrester Research labels these brand-specific mentions "influence impressions" We generate influence impressions whenever we discuss brands openly online. In advertising lingo, an **impression** refers to a view or an exposure to an advertising message. In social media, brands may benefit from influence impressions as well as ad impressions. An **influence impression** is an exposure to a brand via another person--in other words, it's the impressions that are generated through social sharing. Forrester estimates that billions of influence impressions are generated as people talk about their lives with each other, telling stories and experiences that invariably include brands. We also see influence impressions in the form of online reviews, which we cover in depth in Chapter 9. Further, the brand activity in the social media space, whether in the form of tweeting, blogging, social networking, or virtual commerce, encourages people to incorporate this information into their own communication exchanges.

## THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ONLINE COMMUNITIES
* All communities, whether they exist online or in the physical world, share important characteristics: participants experience a feeling of membership, a sense of proximity to one another (even though in online groups other members' physical selves may be thousands of miles away), and in most cases some interest in the community's activities. Social network sites, and other social vehicles, provide value for community memebers by establishing a virtual location and the functionality needed for memebers to connect, communicate, and collaborate.

## PRESENCE
* Though online communities exist virtually rather than a physical location, the better ones supply tangible characteristics that create the sensation of actually being in a place. This is particularly true for virtual world communities that include three-dimensional depictions of physical spaces, but it also applies to visually simplistic online communities such as message board groups. **Presence** refers to the effect that people experience when they interact with a computer-mediated or computer-generated environment. Social media sites enhance a sense of presence when they make the environment look and feel real.

## PURPOSIVE VALUE AND SOCIAL OBJECTS
* Virtual communities do not develop and thrive without a foundation of commonality among the members. Just as your offline communities revolve around family, religious beliefs, social activities, hobbies, goals, place of residence, and so on, your online communities also need commonalities to create bonds among the members. These groups come together to allow people to share their passions, whether for indie bands, white wines, or open-source apps. Community content (whether simple dialogue, shared recipes, event photos, or something else entirely) is generated, shared, consumed, fortified, and promoted by community memebers. The contributions of memebers add value for the general memebership group. 
* **Social object theory** suggest that social networks will be more effective if there is a way to activate relationships among people and objects. In this perspective an object is something of common interest and its primary function is to mediate the interactions between people. All relationships have social objects embedded in the relationship. In the online world, a site such as Facebook provides venues for several object formats to ensure that relationships can  thrive within the site's framework. One factor that drives Facebook's stunning success is that it offers so many objects for users to share; these include photos, live video, events, quizzes, and so on. Memes are a type of social object.
* Other social network sites provide a more specialized or focused set of objects. For example, consider how each of the following SNS incorporates objects as part of its mission. On Instagram users participate because they want to share photos, stories, and videos. These images are the objects that give meaning to the platform and motivate people to visit.

### EXHIBIT 3.5
DOGSTER AND SOCIAL OBJECT THEORY
* Social object theory explains that shared objects give meaning to a social vehicle and motivate memeber engagement. On Diigo, the objects are URLs. On Yelp, the objects are businesses. On Dogster, the objects are our canine companions. On Whisper, secrets are the object.

===

* **Object sociality**, the extent to which users can share an object in social media, clearly relate to an audience's unique interests. It ties the site relationships to a specific object such as photo of people's dogs or bookmarked websites that provide details about the history of alternative music. The audience becomes specialized, at least to a degree. Importantly, though, SNS oriented around object sociality are likely to be passion-centric. That is, the people who join those communities probably not only share an interest in the object. We all know people who devote countless hours to a hobby or who (to an outsider) seem insanely obsessed about the fine details of Star Wars characters, vintage wines, or warring guilds in World or Warcraft.
* In industry terms, vertical networks are sites designed around object sociality. The term refers to the narrow, deep focus of SNS that differentiate themselves because they center on some common hobby, interest, or characteristic that draws memebers to the site. These vertical networks do not attract the same traffic typical of general sites, but one might argue that the memebers are more involved because of the common interest that initially brought them to the site. They function much like so-called niche markets in the physical world. The term niche refers to marketplaces that offer a relatively small number of items to buyers who tend to be loyal to these outlets (e.g., big-and-tall men's stores or tandem bicycles built for two).

## STANDARD OF BEHAVIOUR
* Communities help memebers meet their needs for affiliation, resource acquisition, entertainment, and information. Above all else, communities are active! Whether online or offline, they thrive when the members participate, discuss, share, and interact with others as well as recruit new memebers to the community. Virtual communities need norms, or rules that govern behaviour, in order to operate effectively. Some of these rules are spelled out explicitly (such as when you agree to the terms of use when joining various SNS) but many of them are unspoken. In general, **norms** are mental representations of appropriate behaviour in a community. Social norms are created, shared, and sustained by community members because they promote behaviour that benefits the collective. Without these rules, wee would have chaos. Imagine the confusion if a simple norm in the offline world such as stopping for a red traffic light did not exist!
* In social communities, memebers learn norms through socialization. For instance, researchers attempting to explain the prevalence of aggression expressed online, including vulgarity, insults, bullying, slander, and trolling, found the expressed aggression was more common in social communities in which peer comments were also aggressive. Some of the more prevalent forms of aggression are flaming, doxing, and trolling. **Flaming** refers to posts written with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS TO EXPRESS ANGER. Doxing, a cyber offence that is illegal in the UK, refers to identifying and publishing private information about someone as a form of punishment or revenge.
* Trolling refers to the deliberate provocation of conflict by posting messages that are inflammatory, controversial, insulting, and/or provocative. Trolls are not your average social media user taking advantage of an opportunity to vent or complain. They are online bullies; trolling is a hobby to them, Michael Brutsch, a Reddit troll, is an example. Using the handle ViolentTacrez, Brutsch created offensive subreddits (topics groups on Reddit) with the goal of enraging other Reddit users. Some of the sections Violentacrez created were Chokeabitch, Rapebait, Misogyny, and Jailbait. Unfortunately for marketers, it's become a popular game among troll to bait brands.  If they succeed in eliciting an emotional response, they screenshot it and post it. Whether a marketer or an individual unlucky enought to be the target of a troll, experts recommend ignoring the troll unless the attacks become sufficiently severe to warrant reporting the troll to the social community and blocking the troll.
* As you can see, some norms prevent negative behaviours that are pretty minor; others relate to more serious matters. And while norm enforcement is typically thought of as sactions against community memebers, social media make it possible for communities to attempt sanction against people and businesses beyond the community, as in the case of shaming and online firestorms. David Brooks, a writer for the New York Times, explains that shaming, attempting to make people feel bad by posting many negative comments, marks a shift in the culture of social communities. It the past, people would recognize their bad behaviour by the guilt felt by their conscience. Now, Brooks claims, people are expected to respond to teh voice of the community.
* In addition to social norms, standards of behaviour may also be influenced by anonymity and by explicit agreeements between the community and individual memebers. Open access sites enable anyone to participate without registration or identification. This can be valuable for participation on sensitive topics as well as for ease of use. However, open access also lower the barriers for misbehaviour because it ensures anonymity to users. Just as people tend to "act out" at a costume party when no one knows who they really are, visitors to these sites may post things they might avoid if others knew their real identity. The social contract is the agreement that exists between the host of governing body and the memebers. You engage in a social contract when you indicate agreement to a "term of use" clause for a site. Social contracts set forth expectations for user behaviour as well as for the host of governing body. Some sites such as Facebook, however, come under fire when they make changes to the social contract without user input. The specific concern is typically for the protection of membership privacy.

## GROUPS AND SUBCULTURES
* Within a social community, groups and subculture can thrive. We've seen this since thee early days of research on virtual communities and into the present with the many netnographic studies of niche groups. These communities and subcultures have always existed but often remained on the fringe, unable to reach a critical mass due to logistical inaccessbilitiy to like-minded others. Social media enable these once remote subcultures to network and collaborate. The result is flourishing crowdcultures around almost any topic: anime, minimalism, paleo diets, marathon runners, libertarianism, and more. The potential influence of these communities is illustrated by the phenomenon of crowdsourcing, when tasks are completed collaboratively by a large group of people such that the resulting value far exceeds that which could have been contributed by any single participant.
* members affiliate with communities with which they identify, but the source of commality could be anything--a mission, location, interest, characteristic, and so on. The choice to affiliate is tied to one's social identity, which we introduced in Chapter 2. Social identity is that part of an individual's self-concept that is related to group memebership and it helps us to understand participation in social communities. Participation can be thought of as **intentional social action** in the context of a group. Described as "well-intentions", participation is influenced both by individual attitudes and characteristics and the context and norms of the group.

## PARTICIPATION
* Community members seek out ways to be connected. The site encourages new memebers to connect. It's critical to encourage participation among new memebers; these contributions continue to build the value of the platform for all members. If a social media site starts to lose visitors, it resembles a deserted mining town in the Old West--empty saloons, banks, and stores with (digital) tumbleweed blowing across the streets.
* Your level of participation is based on a mix of four elements: **1) the people with whom you are connected, 2) the content (called artifacts) you produce on the site, 3) the feedback you receive from others, 4) and the distribution of the artifacts and feedback throughout the network.** Of these, the biggest predictor of whether someone will become active in a social network space, regardless of the site's primary function, is the presence of a critical mass of friends. If your friends are present and active in the space, you probably will be too because you will have someone with whom to interact and to reward you for your participation.
* Of these four elements of social network site participation, three are dependent upon the nodes in your network. If your contacts are not active in your experience, your own activity in the network will be stunted because you won't have people with whom to interact, you won't receive sufficient feedback, and your content will not be redistributed. Some nodes will have more connections than others and some will take part in more interactions. These nodes will tend to have greater influence in the network. We'll talk more about influence later in this chapter. Interactions are participative in nature--they are shared activities among members in the network.
* For an online community to thrive, a significant proportion of its members must participate. Otherwise the site will fail to offer fresh material and ultimately traffic will slow. In addition to its importance in community health, participation fuels engagement--the ultimate desired state of being in social media (and a topic we cover more in Chapter 4). The meaning of engagement has been the focus of great scrunity among marketing scholars. Engagement as "a psychological state that occurs through interactive, co-creative consumer experiences with a focal agent/object" highlights the role of participation (in interctive, co-creative experiences) and the context (in this case, the social community). Participation can be a challenge, though, because most users are lurkers, people who review site content but don't actually contribute. Researchers estimate that only 1% of a typical community's users regularly participate and another 9% do only intermittently. The remaining 90% just observe what's on the site, so they don't add a lot of value--other than adding to the number of "eyeballs" the site can claim when it tries to convince advertisers to buy space.
* Sound familiar? This diaparity roughly parallels the larger pattern we often observe in marketing contexts called th 80/20 rule--that roughly 80% of the product is bought by 20% of a brand's users. Marketers label these faithful "heavy users". In many groups or consumer segments, a relative handful of people account for most of the activity; this hard-core group is often the most valuable for organizations to touch because they are the real movers and shakers. Thus, a person's participation is influenced by 20% or less of their network. What do the most effective communities do to promote participation? According to Platform Revolution three factors are responsible: 1) magnetism (i.e., members are attracted to the community and vice versa), 2) user-generated content (members are proactive in contributing content), and 3) value creation (by participating memebers co-create value, thus improving the experience)

## SOCIAL CAPITAL
* When people form community relationships, these affiliations allow them to accumulate resources that they can "trade" for other things. In the offline business world, we clearly see how this process works in the golf subculture. Although many people do love to hit that ball around, the reality is  that a lot of business is transacted on the course and executives profit from their membership of this community (some business schools even offer academic courses on "golf etiquette"!).
* We call these resources **social capital** because their value lies in providing access to others. The resources may be actual or virtual, and they may be held by a group of an individual. For instance, they might include useful information, relationships, the ability to organize groups, employment connections, and more. Do you know anyone who landed a job interview due to the intervention of a friend of a friend? This is an example of social capital at work--especially since jobseekers who know larger numbers of people who already work at high-level jobs are more likely to be able to trade on these connections. Social capital tends to be a limited and protected resource. To return to the golf example, at many country clubs it's not enough just to rolling in money: you also need to be recommended by current members so that the organization controls (fairly or not) just who gets to hobnob on the links and in the locker room.
* Typically, a community is healthier and more desirable when it is able to offer a lot of social capital as an inducement for people to join. Communities build capital through reputation and structure. **Reputational capital** is based on the shared beliefs, relationships, and actions of those in the community such that norms, behaviours, and values held and shared by individuals ultimately support a community reputation. You can think of this like a big, beefy nightclub bouncer who decides whom he will admit past the velvet rope. In fact, like exclusive country clubs, online gated communities that selectively allow access to only some people may offer a high degree of social capital to the lucky few who pass the test.

### EXHIBIT 3.6
RAYA MEMBERS HAVE SOCIAL CAPITAL
* RAYA, an exclusive dating network, is an example of an online gated community that carefully curates memebers to weed out the unattractive. Described as "Tinder for famous people", applicants are screened using selection criteria including Instagram followers, personal recommendation, and individual characteristics (think looks, creativity, and income)

===

* How does online social capital work? Netowkr size, memeber activity, activity quality indicators such as network feedback like number of "favorites", and information flows from a member through his or her network serve as variables that influence one's social capital. Network size is a variable because it promotes the viability of the network we discussed in Chapter 1 and the chance that content will cascade through the community. Member activity reveals the importance of participation. Quality indicators and information flow serve as evidence of value and relevance. All of  this is based on community participation. If and when people participate less in a given social community, the social capital of influencers in that community will diminish as well. As social capital declines, the community experiences decline in its own strength as measured by participation, adherence to norms, perceived reputation, and trust among members. Hopefully you can see that influencers in a community have a lot at stake in keeping the community active and even growing it. In fact, influencers are concerned that Instagram's decision to hide "likes" on posts will har their social capital.
* Interestingly, this is the very phenomenon researchers at Princeton University used to predict the ultimate demise of Facebook. Just as we discussed the way viral content spreads like a disease, we can also view community participation and memebership much like the spread of infection. Using data on the adoption and abandonment of memberships and activity in MySpace, the study built a model using Google Trend data on social network search queries. The model suggested that social networks follow a life cycle (much like a product life cycle) through which social communities will grow, mature, and ultimately decline. The prediction that Facebook would lose 80% of its active members went viral, and Facebook researchers responded with their own study of Princeton enrollment. Using data from Google Scholar and a similar approach to modeling, Facebook's team built a model illustrating that Princeton would lose all student enrollments by 2021. Given the low probability of the latter prediction, Facebook was able to humourously debunk the Princeton study. Nonetheless, it is true that Facebook's meteoric growth is stablizing, espeically as many young people abandon it in favor of more private networks like Snapchat and for "dark social" options like texting.

### EXHIBIT 3.7
IS FACEBOOK'S FUTURE UNCERTAIN?
* Although billions of people worldwide love to share on Facebook, not everyone wants details about their private lives to be available to lurkers (especially to curious parents). In recent years sites like SnapChat that delete posts after a certain amount of time have gained in popularity. Marketers are also less committed to Facebook. For the first time in the last 5 years, Facebook lost share as the most important platform for marketers, dropping from 67% in 2018 to 61% in 2019. One in ten marketers indicated they'll be decreasing their organic marketing on Facebook. What do you predict to be the future of Facebook?

===

### STRONG AND WEAK TIES
* Emotional support is one form of social capital. For example, people who struggle to lsoe weight or fight addictions often prevail because they are part of a group that helps them with these battles, such as Weight Watchers or Alcoholic Anonymous. We call this kind of emotional support **bonding social capital**.
* This resource easily accrues online because of our accessbility to peopel who can help us with a variety of issues even though we may not know them personally. In contrast, our **core ties**, those people with whom we have very close relationships, may or may not be in a position to provide solutions to some problems we face (or we may not want them to know about these in some cases). Interestingly, through the course of giving and receiving bonding social capital, we may come to develop core ties, or at least **significant ties** (somewhat close connections, but less so than core ties), with others in the community.
* Online communities can also provide other kinds of support. This is particularly true of those that increase the accessbilitiy of so-called **weak-ties**. This term refers to contacts with people where your relationship is based on superficial experiences or very few connections. For instance, you have a **strong tie** with your best friend. Perhaps you and she went to high school together and so you have a history of shared experiences and friendships from your past. You then attended college classes together and again you were able to share experiences. You also joined the same sorority so you are bound by your relationship in the context of the organization. In this relationship, there are at least three connection sterams between you and your friend that extend several years and multiple shared experiences--we'd say this is a fairly strong tie.
* In contrast, you likely have weak ties among your Facebook friends, many of whom are just causal acquaintances or even friends of a friend whom you've never met. Weak ties may also be more prevalent when someone is connected to several otehrwise dispersed networks of people. In other words, rather than being central in a few tightly connected networks, the person serves as a node in several relatively unconnected networks. However, we can assure you that weak ties also have value. They may provide **bridging social capital**, the value we get from others who provide access to places, people, or ideas we might not be able to get on our own.
* In fact, many of the connections we make on SNS are not active ties at all. Rather, they are **latent ties**: pre-existing connections that we've discarded. **Maintained social capital** refers to the value we get from maintaining relationships with latent ties. You've probalby heard your parents say they've reconnected with old high school friends on Facebook ("I can't believ how bald he is now!") This is a perfect example of latent ties--as we move through life, some people stay in our lives, but others lose relevance as we develop and change. SNS are valuable connectors for latent ties because they represent a low-involvement, low-effort channel to maintain these bonds. In fact, researchers discovered that college students use Facebook as a way to preseve their network of latent ties. Some of your high school friends may have chosen the same university you did. Others went elsewhere. With sites such as Facebook, you are easily able to stay in touch with these friends, despite the shift in lifestyle and geographic location. Those connection may come in handy if you visit an unfamiliar place or need to find a job.
* Note: earlier we talked about weak and strong ties in communities. Latent ties are not necessarily weak ties. Your BFF in the sixth grade was once a strong tie, but she might now be a latent one. Before the social media era, it's likely you would have just lost track of her unless you both happended to hobble into your 25th class reunion. Now, you can keep your old connections on the radar screen, even if you don't necessarily talk or write to them on a regular basis. SNS enable members to maintain relationships across tie types.

### EXHIBIT 3.8
INFLUENCER CASEY NEISTATE USED SOCIAL CAPITAL FOR GOOD
* Influencers can use their social capital for good. That's what happened when Casey Neistat, a Youtube with more than 5 million subscribers, used his daily vlog to ask for help on behalf of his friend, UPS driver and frequent guest, Marlan Frandlyn. Larlan had been paying his sister's medical expenses to treat her severe kidney disease personally but could no longer shoulder the burdern alone. Casey suggested a GoFundme campaign to crowdsource the needed money--$125,000.
* Watch Casey's plea here: youtu.be/nELmgVd0dWw
* Within a few hours, marlan's GoFundMe campaign was trending. Within four days, nearly 10,000 people from around the world had donated, exceeding the goal by several thousand dollars.

## THE RISE OF INFLUENCERS
* Although consumers get information from personal sources, they do not usually ask just anyone for advice about purchases. If you decide to buy a new sound system, you will most likely seek advice from a friend who knows a lot about this topic. This friend may own a sophisticated system, or may subscribe to specialized magazines such as Stereo Review and spend her free time browsing through electronic stores. However, you may have another friend who has a reputation for being stylish and who spends his free time reading Gentleman's Quarterly and shopping at trendy boutiques. You might not bring up your sound system problem with him, but you may take him with you to shope for a new fall wardrobe.
* **Opinion leaders** (also known as **influencers** or **power users** in some communities) are people who others view as knowledgeable sources of information. They have a strong communication network that gives them the ability to affect purchase decisions for a number of other consumers, directly and indirectly. **Five characteristics help to describe them: 1) activists, 2) connected, 3) impact, 4) active minds, and 5) trendsetters.** In other words, opinion leaders develop a network of people through their involvement in activities. They are active participants at work and in their communities. Their social networks are large and well developed. Others trust them and find them to be credible sources of information about one or more specific topics. They tend to have a natural sense of intellectual curiosity that may lead them to new sources of information.
* Because of their reach and ability to drive engagement with interesting content, influencers have become a sweetheart for social media marketing. According to a study by MediaKix, **80% of marketers find influencer marketing effective and 89% say the return on investment from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels.** Marketers are using influencer marketing to drive brand awareness, reach new audiences, and generate sales. Before we explore influencer marketing further, let's review the underlying characteristics of influencers.
* Opinion leaders exist in all social communities. It is a natural pattern for some members to be more active and to acquire positions of authority within a group, whether offline or online. The source of the influence itself, however, originates from the power bases an influencer may possess.
* How can someone acquire power? French and Raven identified in their classic article, **The Bases of Social Power", several sources of power individuals can accrue in organizations. These sources of power include the following:

* **Reward power**: one's ability to provide others with what they desire.
* **Coercive power**: the ability to punish others.
* **Legitimate power**: organizational authority based on rights associated with a person's appointed position.
* **Referent power**: authority through the motivation to identify with or please a person
* **Expert power**: recognition of one's knowledge, skills, and ability.
* **information power**: one's control over the folow and access to information

* Of course, marketers always want to identify opinion leaders and get them on their team. These people often are the linchpin in a communication strategy; once an opinion leader decides he or she loves your product, it's just a matter of time before others in that person's network hear about it as well. Thus for purchase decisions, opinion leaders are extremely valuable information sources due to their social power.

* They are technically competent so they possess expert power.
* They prescreen, evaluate, and synthesize product information in an unbiased way, so they possess knowledge power
* They are socially active and highly interconnected in their communities.
* They are likely to hold positions of leadership. As a result, opinion leaders often have legitimate power by virtue of their social standing.
* they tend to be similar to the consumer in terms of their values and beliefs, so they possess referent power. Note that although opinion leaders are set apart by their interest or expertise in a product category, they are more convincing to the extent that they are homophilous rather than heterophilous. **Homopilly** refers to the degree to which a pair of individual is similar in t erms of education, social status, and beliefs. Homophily can predict collaborative online relationships and connectivity, whether in professional collaborations like a new product development project or in reciprocal kindnesses among friends in an online network of musicians.
* Effective opinion leaders tend to be slightly higher in terms of status and educational attainment than those they influence, but not so high as to be in a different social class.
* Opinion leaders are often among the first to buy new products, so they absorb much of the risk. This experience reduces uncertainty for the rest of us who are not as courageous. Furthermore, whereas company-sponsored communications tend to focus exclusively on t he positive aspects of a product, the hands-on experience leaders make them more likely to impart both positive and negative information abour product performance. Thus, they are more credible because they have no "axe to grind".

* Opinion leaders in social communities are most likely to deliver these influence impressions: only 6.2% of social media users are responsible for about 80% of impressions. Forrester calls these influencers **mass connectors**, paying homage to Malcolm Gladwell's popular book The Tipping Point. Gladwell posits that three factors work to "tip" a trend, in other words to ignite interest in an idea, behaviour, or product: the law of the few, stickiness, and the power of context.

1. The law of the few proposes that three types of people help to spread viral messages:

                * **Maven** are people who are knowledgeable about many things
                * **Connectors** are people who know many people and communicate with them
                * **Salespeople** are people who influence others with their natural persuasive power.

2. If an idea is sticky, this means it has memorable impact and it stays with us for a long time. Indeed, web designers use the term "stickiness" to describe the extent to which a website captures people's interest so that they stay on the site for a long time.
3. Lastly, Gladwell acknowledges that ideas spread more easily when conditions are right--that's the power of context.

* Though opinion leaders exist in social communities, these communities have also given rise to a different type of influencer--the microcelebrity (also called microinfluencers). Microcelebrities build influence using a self-presentation technique that involves establishing a sense of intimacy with their audiences by sharing content in one or more social communities. Though these influencers are self-branding, the technique ensures they are perceived as authentic, transparent, and relevant. Compared to traditional celebrities, microcelebrities have smaller audiences; they are classified as social personalities with 1000 to 100,000 followers, but they often have higher engagement rates and more influence in their communities. Unlike traditional celebrities who may have large audiences across several social network sites, these influencers tend to specialize in one community. Over time, their audience can grow. Kayla Itsines, a fitness trainers from Australia, is an example. She regularly shares before and after photos of women who follow her fitness protocol, as well as training videos, and pictures of healthy food on Instagram. Her following is now in the several millions; even Time magazine heralded her positive influence motivating women to make better fitness choices as a "virtual movement.
* Figure 3.3 describes a few of the archetypes that characterize social media influencers and examples of the types of brands that work with each archetype. This won't be our only discussion of the role of influencers in social media marketing. Brands partner with influencers to seed campaigns, drive impressions, and increase the likelihood that campaign content will go viral.

## MINI CASE STUDY
INFLUENCER MARKETING
* Influencer marketing is one of the fasting growing strategies for marketers, and agencies like Linqia, Grapestory, and Everywhere have developed to match marketers and influencers and plan effective influencer campaigns. Influencers provide reach for marekters but there are other benefits as well. A study of marketers using influencers in campaigns revealed a plethora of reasons for the rising popularity of influencer marekting. When asked why they chose to work with influencers, 73% of participants noted that the influencers were relevant to their target audience, 72% wanted to leverage the influencers' authenticity and trusted voice, and 60% sought to spark audience engagement.
* Working with influencers is also an efficient way to create content for social media. Traditionally, brands pay professional content creators (e.g., photographers, videographers, writers) to produce content, whether it be a blog post, photo, video, how-to article, or recipe. This can be expensive and time consuming. When brands work with influencers, content is typically a part of the deal. According to the study, 50% of marketers pay influencers a flat rate to produce each piece of content, in the same way that they would engage a professional content producer. On average, this typically costs 2.6 times less than working with a professional for a similar output. It also allows the marketers to categorize the production as a "working spend" because the influencers are sharing the content with their audiences. **Working spend** is a term used to describe investments that reach the target audience such as advertising and event marketing. **Non-working spend** is any cost attributed to creating campaign assets, planning, or managing the campaign. Lacey Meece, strategist for Ragu, explained: "Something as simple as recipe ends up being an  excruciatingly long and expensive process when professional produced. First, we have to pick a product to feature, then hire a food scientist that charge a per recipe fee. Next, we bring in photographers and videographers to shoot the visuals. Working with influencers is far more efficient--they each have their own style and voice and can quickly churn out audience recipes, photos, and videos at scale". Ragu partnered with lifestyle influencer Dzung Duong of the popular Youtube channel Honeysuckle to develop recipes for its Homestyle line of sauces.
* Creating enough good content is a major challenge for social media marketers. Influencers add value by not only reaching more consumers but also creating content that can repurposed for use across a brand's social media channels. Most marketers are repurposing influencer-generated content: 84% post influencer content on the brand's organic social media accounts and 72% drive attention to the content using paid social media.
* Are influencers effective? Nestle's Gerber thinks so. When Gerber launched its Lil' Beanies product and wanted to drive awareness and trial in key markets through Publix, Target, Walmart, and Kroger, it chose influencers as a key part of the social media strategy. The navy-bean-based snack for toddlers has two grams of protein per serving, is non-GMO, and contains no artificial flavors or colors. The advertising budget for the product launch was small and the strategy needed to showcase the brand's alue proposition. Using mommy bloggers as influencers was the perfect solution.
* The hook? Lil' Beanies is a great snack for toddlers. Who were the influencers? Several influencers participated, including Kristy of Mommy Hates Cooking, Shannon of Mom Without Labels, and Susie of Not Quite Susie Homemaker. The bloggers clearly labeled the blog posts as sponsored but also shared their stories with the brand. As important as conveying the positive nutritional information was, the bloggers were able to illustrate that their kids like the snack. Check out their posts to see how the influencers promoted the product while staying true to their followers.
* Effective? We'd say so! The campaign resulted in a reach of more than 56 million impressions and 260,000 interactive engagements. It also produced more than 9,000 pieces of content that could be repurposed in Gerber's social media activities. The proudct achieved a 5% sales life during the campaign, suggesting that the campaign drove sales as well as awareness.

===

* In summary, influencer marketing will likely remain a key social media marketing approach well into the future. When selecting influencers, marketers use the following factors to choose the right influencers for their campaigns.

* Quality of content: 81%
* Target audience: 78%
* Engagement rate: 73%
* On-brand messaging or aesthetic: 56%
* Budget: 50%

## CRITICAL REFLECTION
CHALLENGES FACING INFLUENCER MAREKTING
* Influencer marketing may be today's social media darling, but it comes with challenges. In a study of influencer marketing challenges, MediaKix found that 50% of marketers were concerned about spotting fake followers, 49% worried about changes to the algorithms used by social network sites, 38% were pressured by the rising costs of influencers, 28% felt brand safety and alignment with influencers was an issue, and 18% worried about influencers breaking Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations and guidelines. Instagram has cracked down on third-party services that sell fake followers and inauthentic engagement, but concern over fake followers remain omnipresent. It's possible that companies remain skepitcal because Instagram has not disclosed the scope of third-party apps targeted in the update and because the platform has been caught selling ad space to the same follower-buying services that it banned.
* Influencer fraud occurs when an influencer falsifies estimates of his or her reach and social impact, whether through purchased followers or inauthentic engagement. According to CBS News, influencer fraud cost brands more than $1.3 billion in 2019. Companies spend an estimated $8.5 billion annually to persuade influencers to market their products. The problem? About 15% of the corporate dollars spent are lost to fraud, because influencers don't always have as many real followers as they claim. Brands typically pay influencers based on their reach, as measured by their number of followers. The sng, however, is that influencers sometimes buy fake followers, meaning brands pay for access to prospective customers who essentially don't exist. When an influencer profile is relatively new, but has a larger number of followers, this might be fraud. Influencers may also try to improve their engagement scores by using bots to engage with their posts. These forms of fraud are hard to spot because there's no automated method for identifying influencer fraud. It's a manual and time-consuming validation process.
* Brands aren't the only vitctims of influencer fraud. Regular people can be scammed too. That's because there's an increase in so-call virtual influencers, computer-generated images managed by bots. While some are cartoonish and easily identified, others are so life-like that they appear to be real. What's surprising is that virtual influencers are earning engagement rates that are three times the average for real influencers. So who are these virtual influencers? Lilmiquela is the most popular virtual influencer with nearly two million followers. Other popular virtual influencers include Noonoori and Imma.gram.
* In addition to preventing influencer fraud, social media marketers are also concerned with managing compliance and disclosure requirements by the Federal Trade Commission. To that end, the FTC wants to create more transparency in sponsored content by placing more onus on brands and influencers to openly divulge the relationship between companies and the influencers recommending their products or services. We'll talk more about the FTC and influencer compliance in Chapter 7.

## CASE STUDY
221BC'S SOCIAL INFLUENCE OPTIONS
* 221BC embraces the culture of social media as a way to spread its mission of kombucha as a gateway to a healthy lifestyle. As Aneta said, "When I started doing this, I knew I would be big business. I want to make the world a more beautiful, healthier place. The people I hire for our sales team have the same mission and the same principles. And we use a lot of social media to spread the message.
* When it comes to social communities and influencers. 221BC has a world of options. In terms of social objects, 221BC has focused on photos and videos on Instagram. But many other social objects may fit its mission and target market such as recipes, tips , motivational quotes, and coupons. Those objects and where its target audience is active on social media will determine the social network sites 221BC should leverage in its social media marketing campaign.
* In addition to social objects, 221BC may want to jump on the influencer marketing bandwagon. According to CreatorIQ, a data company that tracks campaigns of more than 5 million creator worldwide, influencer marketing campaigns have doubled in the past year. Instagram was the social network of choice of 93% of those campaigns.
* Of course, 221BC won't be the first kombucha brand to use influencers. Health-Ade Kombucha partnered with health and fitness duo Tone-It-Up for a popular co-branded flavor, Bubbly Rose. Health-Ade partners with an influencer platform called Trend to help identify influencers and manage its influencer campaigns. Health-Ade CEO, Daina Slekye Trout, said, "Trend allows us to always have a fresh stack of creative content to use across our website, social accounts, and ads. The Influencers are a pleasure to work with and always find ways to surprise us with what they can create". Another kombucha brand, Dr. Brew, took a slightly different approach to influencer marketing. It has a student ambassador program (for students with more than 500 Instagram followers) across many university campuses. In exchange for two social promotion posts per week, Dr. Brew student ambassadors get free kombucha and Dr. Brew swag. GT's Living Foods leveraged a meme and organic influencer support! Magician influencer Zach King published a video of himself creatively unscrewing a GT's Kombucha bottle as part of the bottle cap challenge meme. GT's quickly scooped it up and re-posted with hearty praise. This was not a paid influencer sponsorship, but GT's recognizerd the value of King's following and made the most of the organic endorsement.
* 221BC will need to identify influencers that may fit with its target market (identified in Chapter 2) and facilitate meeting its objectives. How do marketers go about selecting influencers? **While metrics like engagement rate certainly matter, the most important quality companies look for when evaluating influencers is the quality of their content. This suggests that strong creative content will be a key differentiator for effective influencer marketing. The second most important factor is influencer alignment with the company's target audience, which highlights the increasing importance of granular audience demographics data for influencer campaigns.** 221BC must keep in mind that the influencer charactertistics must align with its brand identity and its target audience. For instance, a female yoga influencer is a more natural partner for a kombucha drink than a male mindfulness expoert, even if their audiences are very similar.

1. What social objects should 221BC share to engage its target market?
2. How can 221BC leverage word-of-mouth communication?
3. What memes could 221BC use to help the virality of its message?

## STRATEGIC PLANNING AND SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
GT's Living Foods is buying into social media, big time. the company has strategically utilized several different social media zones, channels, and vehicles in recent years. The comapny has an active presence in social communities, including Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and Linkedin. It's committed to social media, including social media strategies in-house to lead its campaigns and "always-on" strategy. Because of its relevance to 221BC, we'll hear more about GT's approach to social media marketing in this chapter.
* For marketers like those at GT's Living Foods, **strategic planning** is the process of identifying objectives to accomplish, deciding how to accomplish those objectives with specific strategies and tactics, implementing the actions that make the plan come to life, and measuring how well the plan met the objectives. The process of strategic planning is three-tiered, beginning at the corporate level, then moving the the business level, and lastly moving to the functional areas of the organization, including marketing. Planners first identify their overall objectives (e.g., "raise consumer awareness of our brand by 10% in the next year") and then develop the specific tactics they will use to reach those goals (e.g., "increase our spending on print advertising in targeted publications by 15% this year"). A **marketing plan** is a written, formalized plan that details the product, pricing, distribution, and promotional strategies that will enable the brand in question to accomplish specific marketing objectives. Table 4.1 provides a sample of an overall marketing plan structure.

                        * How do we integrate supply chain elements to maximize the value we offer to our customers and other stakeholders?

                D: IMPLEMENT AND CONTROL MARKETING PLAN

                1. Action Plans (for all marketing mix elements)
                        * How do we make our marketing plan happen?
                
                2. Responsibility: 
                        * Who is responsible for accomplishing each aspect of implementing the marketing plan?

                3. Timeline:    
                        * What is the timing for the elements of our marketing plan
                
                4. Budget:
                        * What budget do we need in order to accomplish our marketing objectives?
                
                5. Measurement and Control:
                        * How do we measure the actual performance of our marketing plan and compare it to our planned performance and progress toward reaching our marketing objectives?

* On second thought, what's wrong with jumping right into the game? Why should we take the time to plan? Although it's tempting to just follow our instincts, it turns out there is tremendous value in planning. Dumb luck and sweat take you only so far. Planning ensures that an organization understands its markets and its competitors. It helps to ensure that organizations are aware of the chaning marketplace environment. When organizational partners partipate in the planning process, they are better able to communicate and coordinate activities. Planning requires that objectives are set and agreed upon, which improves the likelihood of those objectives being met. It enhances the ability of managers to allocate limited resources using established priorities. Perhaps most of all, planning enables success to be defined. Success or the lack thereof becomes a measurable outcome that can guide future planning efforts.
* it's increasingly common for organizations to include a heavy dose of social media in their marketing plans. The annual **Social Media Marketing Industry Report** provides data on the use of social media marekting by B2B and B2C marketers around the world. The more recent report revealed that 93% of all marketers indicated that their social media efforts have generated more exposure for their businesses, among other benefits. Whether large or small, B2B or B2C, most businesses recognize that social media should be integrated into their marketing plans. most are doing so for branding and demand generation purposes, but social media marketing is also valuable for managing customer service interactions and conducting market research. This upward trend will continue in the coming years.
* It makes sense to include social media marketing in a brand marketing plan. Social media marketing has many applications for marketers. Social media can be a delivery tool to build buzz and word-of-mouth communication. It can efficiently deliver coupons and other special promotional offers. Social platforms can be the primary venue for the execution of contests media can also serve as efficient channels to manage customer service relationships and to conduct research for new product development. Not to mention, social media are relatively inexpensive ways to increase the reach and frequency of messages that are otherwise delivered via more traditional, big media methods.
* Because the creative applications related to social media are somewhat unique, we will suggest an approach for developing an in-depth social media marketing strategy similar to an advertising plan (also known as an integrated marekting communications (IMC) plan or marcom plan) that provides in-depth detail on the execution of the (traditional) promotional portion of a brand's marketing plan. In the early days of social media marketing, many plans were developed for stand-alone campaigns that were not fully integrated into the brand's promotional mix. Today, social media marketing campaigns may serve as stand-alones and/or be a fully integrated media choice in the brand's marcom plan. Many marketers today strive for "always-on" social media to ensure consistent communicaitons and engagement with brand fans. Table 4.2 provides the structure of a social media marketing plan. We'll begin this process as we explore the strategic development of social media marketing plans. Then we'll cover the steps in strategic planning for social media marketing. Finally, we'll discuss structural approaches organizations can take to be prepared to execute their plans.

## THE PHASES OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING MATURITY
* If you keep up with industry news, you might be tempted to think that every brand has a social media strategy. Each day seems to bring new stories about a marketing campaign with social media elements. On ads, storefronts, and business cards, we see "Follow me" calls to action as organizations large and small flock to Twitter and Facebook.
* Although it seems everyone is talking about social media, it's one thing to claim you use social media and quite another to say you have a strategy that incorporates social media. In the former case, a group can turn to social media activities to stage **stunts** (one-off ploys designed to get attention and press coverage) or as **activation tools** to support other marketing efforts. For example, when Skittles let its social media presence take over its website, that was a stunt. But when Starbucks runs social media promotions, it integrates these promotions with the overall campaign in place. The most engaging brands using social media for marketing will ensure that all communications are consistent with the brand's image, while using social media as an element for experimentation and engagement with short-term campaigns as well as use in omni-channel marcom campaigns.
* As organizations develop in their social media marketing maturity, they plan systematically to ensure social media marketing activities are consistent with their marketing and marketing communications plans and are capable of meeting specific marketing objectives. By this we mean that, as a result of time and experience, we tend to see that applications that start as one-time "experiements" often morph into more long-term and carefully thought-out elements that the organization integrates with all the other communication pieces it uses to reach customers.
* Nevertheless, many marketers currently use social media marketing tactics without that level of maturity. A major study of marketers in both Europe and North America found huge differences in the level at which respondents use social media and integrate them with their other initiatives. Many still just experiement with baby steps (like managing a Facebook page) rather than include social media as a fundamental components of their marketing strategy. Companies can be thought of in terms of their level of maturity in social media marketing, of which there are three phases: trial, transition, and strategic. Let's take a closer look at each phase.

### TRIAL PHASE
* The trial phase is the first phase of the adoption cycle. Organizations in the trial phase test out social media platforms, but they don't really consider how social media can play a role in the overall marketing plan. In these early days, most groups focus on learning to use a new form of communication and exploring the potential for social media as a venue.
* It isn't necessarily a bad thing to test the waters of social media. Companies need, especially early on, to experiment--to play in the sandbox, so to speak. Doing so helps them to brainstorm ideas to use social media and understand what it takes to succeed in this brave new world. However, the problem with the trial phase is that many companies do not treat it as an exploratory stage of what is really a multi-stage process. Instead they just jump right in and focus only on cool new ways to communicate. Think this couldn't happen? According to the 2019 Social Media Marketing Industry Report, 35% of marketers have been using social media for less than two years.

### EXHIBIT 4.1:
THE TRANSITION STAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* GT's Living Foods appears to be in the strategic phase of social media marketing now, but that wasn't always the case. In 2010, the brand was in the transition stage of social media marketing. How do we know? In 2010, GT's Kombucha mysteriously went missing from supermarket shelves. Customers learned through word-of-mouth communication that the product's alcohol content was mislabeled. During shipment, the product was unrefrigerated, causing the alcohol content to rise above regulated levels and beyond the indicated on its labels. This was a clear concern for people who drank it for the health benefits, and especially pregnant women. The tainted kombucha was removed from shelves, but GT's failed to handle the social media response. Hundreds of fans posted to GT's Facebook page asking when the product would be available and what had happened. There was no response from GT's! The brand simply didn't respond! What would you think? You got it. Social media is 24/7. Brands don't have the option of being on only eight hours per day. issues like this can be amplified by influencers. We tend to think of brands partnering with influencers to increase the reach and spread of positive content. But if influencers have a negative experience, their complaint spread as well. GT's Living Foods learned this the hard way. Fortunately, the brand has improved its social media responsiveness over time.

### TRANSITION PHASE
* An organizations mature in their use of social media marketing, they enter a **transition phase**. During this phase, social media activities still occur somewhat randomly or haphazardly but a more systematic way of thinking starts to develop within the organization. In the transition stage, brands are on the right track but may not have fully formed a strategic approach. For instance, the brand may have established social media profiles and be using them regularly but still make mistakes. A common one is the use of automation to schedule social media posts and replies. This means that some of the responses to tweets or Facebook posts (or other social media comments) are programmed. In the industry, these automated responses are useful for workflow management but users view automation as fake, referring to the practice as **social media zombies**. In and of itself, that's not bad. Automation can help brands be responsive. But if overused or use ineffectively, people will know. And they will resent it.

### STRATEGIC PHASE
* When an organization enters the final strategic phase, it utilizes a formal process to plan social media marketing activities with clear objectives and metrics. Social media are now integrated as a key component of the organization's overall marketing plan. While making a strategic commitment to social media marketing takes time, it also comes with benefits. Marketers report increased brand exposure, brand attitudes, and even sales driven from social media marketing. Of course, this isn't necessarily easy, even for marketers with substantial experience using social media. A need to show the ROI for marketing activities coupled with a fluid social media environment creates challenges.

### CRITICAL REFLECTION
SOCIAL MEDIA AREN'T EASY
* marketers are smitten with social media. Social media investment remains high. For example, in the US, spending on social network is expected to exceed $43 billion. According to the CMO Survey, social media spending makes up more than 11% of marketing budgets. Clearly, commitment to social media is strong. That said, social media marketing is not without disadvantages. Let's take a look at some of the concerns marketers face when marketing with social media.

1. Socia media are time consuming.
* This is one of the biggest cons of social media marketing. For an effective marketing effort, you need to invest time engaging and publishing social content suitable enough to keep your audience interested and engaged. This requires time to develop high-quality content as well as time posting to SNS and replying to posts from fans and critics. Social media may cost less in hard currency than some other media forms, but they require more human touch. What's more, time must be a continuous investment. Social media marketing is not a quick marketing solution. It can take a long time to achieve your objectives. As much as we hear about the successes of memes and viral videos, it is important you know social media are not a genie that will instantly start granting wishes; it takes time.

2. ROI is difficult to measure.
* To date, Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) acknowledge that social media's contribution to organizational performance has been relatively modest. On a scale of 1 = not at all contributing to 7 = very highly contributing, respondents to the CMO Survey rated social media's contribution between 3.1 and 3.3 over the last five years. In part, the ratings may be due to the difficulty in measuring social media return on investment. As we'll discuss in Chapter 11, "likes" and impressions provide initial metrics on the success of social media efforts, but it can be difficult to deduce how social media contribute to acquiring new customers and driving sales. CMOs say they struggle with this issue. The CMO Survey found that 39.3% of companies report they are unable to show the impact of social media on performance, and another 36% have a good qualitative sense of the impact, but not a quantitative measure of the impactt. Every social media marketing effort has an objective whether that is to increase website traffic, drive sales, or build brand awareness. It can be difficult to attribute outcomes to social media marekting efforts.

3. There is a risk of negative publicity
* Social media marketing is a very powerful tool for the promotion of a company, but it can also use that the same force to pull down or negatively impact a business. When organization adopt social media marketing, they are also exposing the brand to external threats. Just as people face social media trolls, so do brands. Trolls may slander a brand and post negative comments even when they have no idea what the company does. Without proper management, such negative publicity can go viral and irreparably damage the reputation of your business.

* Legitimate negative publicity can also gain traction via social media channels. For example, Johnson & Johnson faced a major public relations challenge related to its perceived role in the opiod epidemic and amid concerns about the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder, which was the target of a major product recall. Vocal consumers took to Twitter to express outrage at the possibility of asbestos in Johnson's baby Powder, and the firestorm spread to other J&J brands including Aveeno. Aveeno's online net sentiment plummeted! The situation was worsened when Aveeno's spokesperson, Jennifer Aniston, was accused of posting a photo of herself revealing possible illicit drug use. Aveeno's brand equity was surely damaged by these Twitter posts and conversations.

## SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS: THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS
* Those organizations that have moved beyond the trial and transition phases of social media marketing maturity develop strategic plans for social media that incorporate components of the social media mix as channels to accomplish marketing objectives. As we saw in Table 4.2, the process consists of the following steps:

                * Conduct a situation analysis and identify key opportunities
                * State objectives and allocate resources
                * Gather insight into and target one or more segments of social consumers.
                * Select the social media mix (zones, channels, and vehicles)
                * Create an experience strategy.
                * Establish an activation plan using other promotional tools (if needed)
                * Execute and measure the campaign.
        
## SITUATION ANALYSIS
* The first step in developing the plan is much the same as it is in the creation of traditional strategic plans--**research and assess the environment. Good social media planning starts with research on the industry and competitors, the product category, and the consumer market. Once this research is compiled, stratgists try to make sense of the findings as they analyze the data in a situation analysis.**
* The situation analysis details the current problem or opportunity the organization faces. It will typically include a social media audit. In addition to the standard things marketers need to know, the social media audit ensures the team understands the brand's experience in social media. The audit will assess the brand's past social media activity, including whether profiles and consistent with the brand image, frequency of activity, types of activity, responsiveness, engagement, and other measures of effectiveness. Free tools that are useful for auditing social media activities are LikeAlyzer, Fan Page Karma, and AgoraPulse. Audit report can also be created using paid vendor services like those from Sprout Social, Sysomos, and others. Figure 4.1 provides a template for beginning a social media audit.
* In addition, a review of the brand's SWOT analysis will highlight relevant aspects of the firm's internal and external environment that could affect the organization's choices, capabilities, and resources. This acronym refers to strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that the firm should consider as it crafts a strategy. The internal environment refers to the strengths and weaknesses of the organization--the controllable elements inside a firm that influence how well the firm operates. The external environment consists of those elements outside the organization--the organization's opportunities and threats--that may affect its choices and capabilities. Unlike elements of the internal environment that management can control to a large degree, the firm can't directly control these external factors, so management must respond to them through its planning process.
* A key aspect of the external environment is the brand's competition. Analyzing competitive social media efforts and how the target market perceives those efforts is a must-do in social media marketing planning. It can be done in much the same way as the social media audit--except the focus in on the competing firms. You can use an internal system or a **cloud service** such as Klue (klue.com) to organize competitive information and to monitor news and social activity. When you use Klue, you can maintain a search of competitive activity and news mentions online for a small fee. Figure 4.2 illustrates a template for tracking a social media competitive analysis. Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi Brand Analysis, which assesses effectiveness as well as brand activity in social media. A competitive social media analysis should answer the following questions:

* In which social media channels and specific vehicles are competitors active?
* How do they present themselves in those channels and vehicles? Include an analysis of profiles, company information provided, tone, and activity
* Who are their fans and followers? How do fans and followers respond to the brand's social activity?

* Importantly, marketers have many approaches to solve problems and taking advantage of opportunities. Here we are concerned with the organization's use of social media, but still, the planner should ask the question, "Given the situation and the problem identified, is social media marketing the appropriate approach?" Especially for organizations that are still in the trial phase, it's tempting to focus on social media "gimmicks", even if other less trendy tactics might in fact be more effective. So, a word of caution: social media often provide effective solutions to marketing problems, but beware of blindly using these tools.
* To see how the early stages of the strategic planning process work in the real world, let's return to our example, GT's Living Food. GT's uses social media as part of its integrated social media initiatives, particularly related to community altruism. It does so in a way that resonates with specific social media vehicles like Facebook, Twitter, instagram, Youtube, and Pinterest. GT's Living Foods is the market leader in kombucha and has more shelf space and brand awareness than any other kombucha brand. That's why GT's founder is called the King of Kombucha. But GT's faces stiff competition from other major brands, regional brands, and even do-it-yourselfers who brew their own kombucha at home. Table 4.3 provides a SWOT analysis for GT's Living Foods.

## IDENTIFY SOCIAL MEIDA MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES
* In this stage of the process, the planner elaborates on what is expected of the social media campaign and what financial and human resources are available to meet those objectives. An **objective** is a specific statement about a planned social media activity in terms of what that activity intends to accomplish. The content of the objective will vary based on the situation and the problem at hand. For instance, the campaign may be designed to amplify other marketing communication efforts the organization uses. Let's say, for example, the brand co-sponsors a concert series. This series is an event marketing strategy built into the overall marketing commmunication plan. But the organization realizes that promoting the event using social media can build pre- and post-event buzz. In this case, the objective (to create heightened awareness of the event among target customers) relates to other activities in the organization.
* The basic assumption is that the campagin can accomplish the desired marketing objectives. What are some examples of the basic marekting objectives social media marketers pursue? Figure 4.3 illustrates several social media objecitves. here are some important ones: 

                * Increase brand awareness
                * Improve brand or product reputation
                * Increase website traffic
                * Amplify or augment public relations work
                * Improve search engine rankings
                * Improve perceived customer service quality
                * Generate sales leads
                * Reduce customer acquisition and support costs
                * INcrease sales/sales revenue.

* In this tage of planning, it's important to state the objectives in a way that will help the planner to make other decisions in the planning process and eventually to measure the extent to which the objective was accomplished at specific points into the campaign. A well-stated, actionable objective should include the following characteristics:

* be specific (what, who, when, where)
* be measurable
* specify the desired change (from a baseline)
* include a timeline
* be consistent and realistic (given other corporate activities and resources)

* Here's an example of an actionable objective: To increase site stickiness in the retail areas of our site by 100% (from five minutes browsing to ten minutes per site visit) with the addition of social commerce sharing applications by the end of the third quarter. The statement of the objective should include specific elaboration on the individual goals  the brand wishes to achieve over the course of the campaign, taking care to state these goals such that they are specific, measurable, realistic, adn time-lined. We don't know GT's precise objectives but we can gauge that GT's seeks to generate engaging content for popular social networks, build its gan base in social communities, build brand equity, and increase top-of-mind awareness.

                FIGURE 4.3: Top Objectves Marketers Pursue Using Social Media
                * increase Exposure
                * Increase traffic
                * Generated leads
                * Improve sales
                * Developed loyal fans
                * Provided marketplace insight
                * Increase thought leadership
                * Grew business partnership

* There should be a focus on resources. You've probably heard people say that the main benefit of social media marketing is that it's free. When brand managers work with agencies to plan traditional advertising campaigns, the cost of media placement can seem overwhelming. With that as a point of comparison, one can see why many might think of social media marketing as the free alternative to advertising. Even for brand participation in social network sites, social media are not free. In planning a social media campaign, a budget must be allocated that ensures sufficient resources to accomplish the goals--just like in a traditional ad program. Granted, the media costs are often must lower compared to, say, a national television campaign. But there are other costs associated with social media. Charlene Li, a leading social media strategist, once said, "Social media trades media costs for labor costs"
* What does Li's comment mean? To a large extent, the social communities in which brands engage consumers are indeed free to play spaces in term of media costs. But there are other costs we must take into account. Content must be generated, shared, and managed, and the time that that takes requires funding. Strategies in some social media channels of our social media framework require development costs (in-house or with a vendor or agency) such as customizing profiles and developing social games, branded applications and widgets, and microsites. Organic reach is increasingly difficult for brands to achieve as well. The result in an increase in  the use of advertising (paid media) on SNS. At the end of the day, there's no such thing as free lunch!
* Most organizations to date allocate only a small portion of their marketing budgets to social media. Current estimates are under 10%! Though that budget is expected to nearly double in the next five years! Where will this money be spent? Primarily organizations are staffing for content management, ensuring that time is available for content development, blogging, and monitoring of social channels and paying for social advertising. As we described in Chapter 1, the job of social media manager, akin to that of a brand manager, is becoming more commonplace. This person has the role of overseeing, managing, and championing the social media strategy internally. Most organizations now have a dedicated team for social media marketing, but 80% of teams have fewer than four people. Typical roles include that of social media strategist, community manager, social media analyst, and social media assoicate. In addition, organizations may budget for software and services to manage social media acocunts, manage projects, analyze effectiveness, automate tasks for efficiency, host content, monitor social conversations and collect data, and facilitate content creation. Agencies and other providers can supplement the work of the social media manager (or team) with ideas, ways to integrate social media marketing with the rest of the brand's marcom plan, technical expertise, and measurement.
* As with everything else in business, the budget is critical--without funding, the organization can't initiate or maintain the campaign. How much should it allocate? When it comes to social media campaigns, budgets run the gamut from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
* Many companies approach social media marketing budgets as a percentage of their ad spends, which in turn are assigned by planners within the organization according to one of several formulae. The percentage of ad spend method assigns a set portion of the overall advertising budget for the organization to social media activities. Some use a variation, where they allocate a percentage of online marketing funding to social media.
* Two other methods are used by companies. the competitive parity method uses competitors' spending as a benchmark. Like advertiser share of voice, competitive parity is based on the belief that spending the same or more on social media marketing will result in a comparable change in share of attention for the brand. When it comes to social media, though, share of voice takes on a new dimension; social media include conversation about the brand from other sources. In contrast, with advertising, increasing share of voice is accomplished by simply purchasing more media time for advertisements.
* With soial media marketing, the costs of different approaches and platforms vary widely, and even a large spend may not result in widespread buzz or content sharing and viral spread. The resulting share of voice depends in part of the extent to which fans and friends share the message with their own networks. Lastly, the objective-and-task method considers the objectives set out for the campaign and determines the cost estimates for accomplishing each objective. This method builds the budget from a logical base with what is to be accomplished as the starting point.

## PROFILE THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF SOCIAL CONSUMERS
* Social media marketing plans, like any marketing plan, must target the desired audience in a meaningful and relevant manner. To do this the development of a social media profile of the target audience is required. The target market for the brand will have been defined in the brand's marketing plan in terms of demographic, geographic, psychographic, and product-usage characteristics. The target audience's social profile will take this understanding of teh market one step farther. It will include the market's social activities and styles, such as their level of social media participation, the channel they utilize and the communities in which they are active, and their behaviour in social communities. You learned about the elements of segmentation and targeting and the use of personnas in Chapter 2.
* The strategic planner must assess what it means to speak to the audience in the social media space. Who is the core target? How can we describe the key segments of that core target? To whom will the conversations in social media be directed? Of which social communities are the consumers a member? How do they use social media? How do they interact with other brands? The insights from the consumer profile that was done for a brand's overall marketing and marcom plans will be useful to understand the overall profile of the target market.
* However, the planner also must understand how and when his or her customers interact in online social communities, as weell as which devices they use to do so. In developing a consumer profile, the planner may plot out a typical day for the social media user as well as gather information on the Internet activites of the audience.
* However, the planner also must understand how and when his or her customers interact in online social communities, as well as which devices they use to do so. In developing a consumer profile, the planner may plot out a typical day for the social media user as well as gathering information on the Internet actvities of the audience.
* GT's profiles will align its sub-brands. The target audience for its Aqua kefir is different than that for its Synergy product line, and so on. For example, Aqua Kefir was designed for non-kombucha drinkers. GT's Living Foods uses the insights about each persona to guide specific campaigns and interactions across its social media activities

## SELECT SOCIAL MEDIA MIX: ZONES, CHANNELS, AND VEHICLES
* Once the organization understands who it wants to reach, it's time to select the best **social media mix** to accomplish this. The zones of social media make up the channel and vehicle choices available for a social media mix. Similar to a more traditional marketing mix, the social media mix describes the combination of vehicles the strategy will include to attain the organization's objectives.
* The social media mix options lie among the four zones we've already discussed: relationship development in social communities, social publishing, social entertainment, and social commerce. We cover these zones in depth in the next section of the book. Within each zone are many specific vehciels that may be best suited to reach a certain audience. For instance, to meet the desired objectives and the social media patterns of a target audience that includes college students, the planner may determine that the campaign should include social networking, social publishing, and social games. The media vehecles might include Facebook, Youtube, and Flickr. Social publishing may utilize a corporate blog and document sharing sites such as Scribd. Brands can leverage the popularity of games, music, and video using the zone of social entertainment. It's also a good idea at this stage of planning to map out how the campaign will build earned media and utilize paid and owned media synergistically.

### EXHIBIT 4.2
GT'S EXPERIENCE STRATEGY INVITES FANS TO PARTICIPATE
* To promote its latest special edition kombucha, Pure Love, GT's Living Foods created a UGC campaign for Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. According to GT's Living Foods, this exclusive winter flavor enhances its kombucha with fresh pressed blood orange, rose, hibiscus, and 100% pure love. The Pure Love social media campaign seeks to promote universal love by inspiring acts of love for one's self and others. Even the bottle design was artistically render to capture the pure love sentiment. The founder and CEo of GT's Living Foods, known as GT Dave, said: "We believe now, more than ever, the world needs more love. Sometimes the world feels like a dark place--we can be slow  to love, but so quick to hate. Our flavor, Pure Love, is intended t oshine a bright light on what love is supposed to be--without limits, without race, without gender, without religion. Love is supposed to be pure"
* Instagram's user profile matches the persona for GT's target audience and UGC campaigns inspire engagement. The experience? Fans post a selfie with someone they love and a bottle of GT's Kombucha and tag the photo with #GTsPureLove. Each month, GT's will gift one winner with a special weekend gateway to experience with someone they love. The concept aligned with GT's overall marcom campaign, while effectively engaging the target audience. not only was the choice of experience and social vehicles appropriate given the target persona, the campaign was designed for propagation. Fans who contributed ideas were invested in the campaign and likely to share the campaign content with their friends. Importantly, all of GT's social media campaigns are built on UGC experiences, which help to ensure a stream of fresh content alongside fan engagement.

===

* GT's utilizes many of the zones of social media and multiple vehicles within each zone. The choice of zone and vehicle is based on the nature of the marketing objective and the persona characteristics, as well as how best to bring the experience strategy to life. See Figure 4.4 for a summary of GT's zone activity.

                Figure 4.4: GT's Zones of Social media Marketing

                Community: 
                        * Active participation in SNS, sharing content with hashtags, replying to fans, and interacting with influencer profiles
                        * In addition to GT's Living Foods, the CEO, GT Dave, is also active 
                        * Incentivized UGC contests
                        * Profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Pinterest
                Publishing: 
                        * Entertainment video content to Youtube
                        * Video and photo content to Instagram including words of enlightment
                        * Image content published to Pinterest
                        * History and benefit of kombucha content published on website and youtube
                Entertainment:
                        * Social music (e.g., interaction with Spotify including branded playlist)
                        * Donations to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation for UGC participation
                        * Participation in "bottle cap challenge" meme
                Commerce:
                        * Reviews and ratings

## DESIGN AN EXPERIENCE STRATEGY
* If we were planning advertising campaign, the next step would be to identify a creative message strategy. Message strategy refers to the creative approach we will use throughout the campaign. This should flow from the brand's **position statement**--a single written statement that encapsulates the position the brand wishes to hold in the minds of its target audience. Positioning statement succinctly capture the heart of what the brand is and what the sponsor wants it to become. Reviewing the position is a necessary step in preparing a social media marketing strategy, because the social media activities campagin plans and executes need to consistently suppport the desired message.
* Can you identify the brands that go with these positioning statement?

1. The computer for the rest of us
2. Networking networks
3. The world's information in one click
4. personal video broadcasting network

* The message strategy should also be appropriate to meet the campaign's objectives. it is developed from a creative brief--a document that helps creatives channel their energy toward a sound solution for the brand in question. In planning for social media marketing campaigns the design process works similarly; the planners create a brief to guide the development of the campaign. But--because unlike traditional media, social media focus on interactive experiences, social sharing, and engagement--the brief has a somewhat different structure and goes by a different name. Some planners call this document an experience brief.
* The concept of an experience brief evolved from the work of website developers who consider the direct impact on users when they design site architecture, imagery, copy and other site features. Griffin Farley, a strategy planner, uses a different term. He describes the planning document for social media as a propagation brief. He explains that propagation planning means to plan not for the people you reach, but for the people who they will reach. In other words, the audience produces more audience. Traditional advertising promotes a message to a passive audience, and that audience is the target. **Social media invite an interactive experience with an audience of influencers who will then share the brand's message and invite others to the experience.**
* Researchers conceptualize **brand experience** as the sensations, feelings, thoughts, and behaviours evoked by brand-related stimuli when consumers interact with brands, whether during exposure to brand messaging, shopping and service interactions, or product consumption. The four dimensions of brand experience point to important element in experience design: 

* To trigger the sensory dimension, the experience should engage the senses, especially visual.
* To evoke the affective dimension, the experience should be emotional
* To activate the behavioural dimension, the experience should enable phyiscal action.
* To stimulate the cognitive dimensions, the experience should stimulate curiosity, problem-solving, or other intellectual motive.

* Based on the brand experience dimensions, social media marketing strategies should use visual elements like video, emotional creative appeals (like humor, love, guilt, nostalgia, and fear), and interactive features. Surprisingly, research suggests that brands have focused on functional messages in social media marketing, far more than emotional messages. In one study of top brands using social media, nearly 90% of the brands studied used functional messages but only 57% used interactivity and 43% used emotional appeals. The study found that engagement and influence were both positively influenced by emotional appeals and interactivity, while functional appeals had no effect at all.
* To develop a social experience worthy of participation and worthy of sharing, social media planners ask and answer several questions. The answers become the basis for the brief:

* **What are the campaign goals and/or communication tasks? Objectives have been set for the campaign and the use of social media identified as a possibility. Here the planner reviews these decisions and provides a succinct overview of the goals.**
* how is the brand positioned? What is unique and special about its position in the marketplace? As in a traditional creative brief, any campaign work should leverage the brand's positioning strategy and build on the brand's strengths.
* Who is the target audience? You've profiled the target already. Now consider what you want the audience to do. Do you want them to talk to the brand? Create and share content? Spread the message to their network? On what devices (e.g., iPad, smartphone, desktop) will they interact with your brand? What could you offer of value in exchange for their cooperation?
* Is there another group of people who can persuade the target audience to follow them? This group comprises your influencers--the people who will propagate your message. Why would these people want to share your message with others? What's in it for them?
* What are the existing creative assets? How can the brand's creative assets foster a social experience? Most brands already have some **creative assets** that drive their paid and owned media. For example, a well-known and popular brand spokescharacter such as the GEICO gecko is a creative asset that the insurance company has developed in its traditional advertising, so he might be employed in a social media campaign to give the company a head start in terms of consumer recognition as it tries to break through the clutter of competing messages. The planner should list the creative assets that already exist and identify the assets he or she still needs in order to extend the brand's story. how can the creative assets already available be used and/or leveraged in a social media context?
* How can we integrate with other branded media being used by the organization, and how long do we have to execute? This is a question that references how the campaign can integrate best with the brand's paid and owned media.
* What experience are possible given target market needs and motives, the available channels, and the creative assets? How can we design these experiences to maximize device portability and access? Creative assets used in social media campaigns should inspire activity and interactivity. These questions ask what types of activities could be engaging for the target audience using multiple devices and worth sharing with their network.
* What content will be needed? Social media are content-driven. What content will be relevant to the campaign and what will be the source? Comments? Questions and polls? Videos? Images? Stories? Apps?
* How will experience engagement be extended and shared throughout the social channels? For instance, will engagement activity auto-post to status updates (e.g., "Tracy created a GT's playlist on Songpop")?

* After the planner goes through the process of discovery and briefing to provide these "must-knowns" to the creative team, the creative team will then enter the stage of ideation or concepting. **Discovery** is the term used to describe the research stage of the plan. Planners may rely on secondary and primary research as they seek to discover insights that will be useful to the creative team. These insights will be presented to the team during the briefing. The creative team will spend time brainstorming ideas and developing possible concepts for the campaign. Eventually the chosen ideas will be further refined and designed, and prototypes or mock-ups will be developed. These preliminary executions can then be used for internal review, usability testing, and other pre-testing.
* When a brand begins to interact in social spaces, **a key decision is how to represent the brand's social persona**. This means planners need to define how the brand will behave in the social web, what voice will be used, and even how deeply the brand will interact in the social space with customers. The decisions made should support the brand's position in the market. To introduce that persona, brands have several creative options. They may involve humanizing the brand (again, think of the GEICO gecko); showing a vulnerability to the customer and working as a steward to customer service (think Dell); or providing a value to the customer whether that value be function, information, or entertainment (think Nike). In GT's case, the brand's position is brand as corporate entity; though the founder, GT Dave, also has an active social media presence as a brand spokesperson.
* Additionally, the makeup of the brand's social persona may vary. Other brands, such as Zappos, utilize different employee voices in social communities so the online retailer's persona is the sum of its employees. Still others have represented the brand with a person, but with a single individual charged with the brand's social reputation. The brand's mascot may take the social stage as Travelocity has done with its Roaming Gnome. **Some brands present themselves as funny, comedic, thought leaders, and friends.** There is no right or wrong social persona--it should ulitmately be a social representation of the brand's position and of course be consistent with how the brand presents itself in other contexts.

### EXHIBIT 4.3
GT'S BRAND PERSONALITY SHINES IN SOCIAL MEDIA
* GT Dave and GT's brand personalities are reflected in their social media banter. In addition to brand fans, GT's Living Food's presence in zone 1--social community--also includes engaging with critics! It's any social media marketing pro's nightmare. GT Dave was singled out in a mocking Youtube video in which he was called The Kombucha King. Youtube creator Cody Ko published the video in which he and a colleague mocked Dave. The Kombucha King video garnered nearly 8 million views and 18,000 comments-- many of which were as unflattering. Most would be tempted to ignore such a crisis and hope it would simply blow over. Not GT Dave! instead, Dave shared the video on his personal Instagram profile with the message: "I love a good roaast and I think this video is funny as hell. Check it out if you want a good laugh--at my expense" Dave's post earned thousands of "likes"--more than seven times the average engagement on Dave's other Instagram content. Dave didn't stop there. He invited Ko and Miller to meet with him. As told in Winchel (2019), Dave said: "I was pleased to see that it was more of a "roast" and that you could tell that Cody is a legit fan of the product so he was cognizant of what lines he shouldn't cross. That was the impetus for me to reach out to them as I was convinced they were good guys and we could do something funny together." Ko and Miller documented their experience with GT Dave in another video called "Visiting the Kombucha Lair" which has more  than 6 million views. Dave shared the follow-up video on his Instagram with the tongue-in-check caption: "Who knew being cyber-bullied could be so much fun!" Dave's response made the most of the social media exposure and netted him new fans. Engagement across all of GT's Living Food's social media profiles increased and fans applauded GT Dave for his sense of humor. This was smart engagement! The response was clever, funny, and relevant! Plus, because the banter was picked up by news outlets as a story, GT's was able to reach an even larger audience--but without the cost of paying influencers. Dave said, "You also need to be aware of your tone, words, and of course any imagery as you're in somewhat of a hybrid role of still being a brand representative but also being perceived a peer. You have to maintain a balance of a professional position while still having a casual and relaxed quality about you". The story serves as a reminder to marketing pros that not all social media trolling has a bad ending.

## INTEGRATING WITH OTHER PROMOTIONAL COMPONENTS AND ESTABLISH ACTIVATION PLAN
* Traditional media campaigns typically live a desinated lifespan with timing tied to the accomplishment of specific objectives. For social media, though, campaigns are not necessarily events with fixed start and stop dates. Conversations in communities continue over time, and a brand's social media marketing presence should do this as well. This is particularly true for brands that rely on social media for customer service and custoemr relationship management. Some of the most famous social brands, like Dell and Zappos, are "always on" with their social media campaigns. They aim to project a constant presence in the communities in which they participate. GT's Living Foods uses a mix of short-term campaigns and ongoing presence. Other organizations have also done this.

### EXHIBIT 4.4
GT'S MAKES SOCIAL COMMUNITY MEANINGFUL
* Brand-created experiences are among the most effective tactics for building consumer engagement. GT's connects with its loyal customers thorugh its "Living in Gratitude" social media strategy--by tying philanthropic donations to UGC on social media channels. For example, to promote its Living in Gratitude kombucha flavor, GT's asks fans to post a photo with a GT's donates ten meals to people in need via Feeding America, the nation's largest organization dedicated to fighting domestic hunder through a network of food banks. The approach leverages the altruistic motive (discussed in Chapter 2), rewards fans for their UGC engagement, and ensures plenty of social media content to keep GT's social media feeds fresh and interesting. The campaign also educates fans with a video about hunder on GT's Youtube Channel. That's not GT's Living Foods' only philanthropic campaign. Its employees are also actively volunteering throughout the community. For instance, the brand launched a program hashtag #GT4Good, where employees can volunteer to help local organizations. For example, the brand volunteered at Los Angeles-based Grow Good, a non-profit organization that works to turn communities into agricultural centers filled with all kinds of greenery. In another campaign, GT's asked fans to post a picture of themselves with their bottle of kombucha using the hashtag #InFullBloom. For every picture received, GT's donated $5 to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation. Clearly, GT's is infusing philanthropy thorughout its social media marketing strategy.

## EXECUTE AND MEASURE OUTCOMES
* In the final stage of the strategic planning process, we implement the plan and measure the results. In Chapter 11, we'll go into detail about the metrics we can use to assess the effectiveness of social media campaigns. The data gathered on all aspects of the social media plan are used to provide insight for future campaigns.
* As we've seen, many organizations are still "social media wannabes". They 're at an early stage in the process and feeling their way in a new environment. So perhaps we can forgive them for the common mistakes they tend to make. Here are some of the biggest offenders:

* Staffing: the initial imperative when it comes to social media marketing is to simply get there--to have a presence in the community of interest. But focusing on presence can result in brand assets that are underutilized and underperforming in terms of the objectives set of the campaign. Organizations in the trial and transition phases tend to focus on establishing Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts, or perhaps on planning a UGC contest. These companies take an "if you build it, they will come" Field of Dreams approach, **without addressing ways to build and maintain traffic and interest. ultimately though, social media marketing is built on the community , content, and technology inherent to social media. To make it successful, the brand must be active in the space--and that means committing staff time to posting, responding, and developing content.**
* Content: a related issue is the failure to introduce new, fresh, and relevant content. Developing interactivity, emphasizing relevant, monitoring the asset for needed maintenance, responding to visitor feedback, and providing new content will keep the asset fresh and inspire a curiosity to return among the core audience. Importantly, these components of successful social media marketing require an ongoing commitment of human resources.
* **Time horizon: social media work differently tahn do traditional advertising, and may require patience before results are delivered.** Although television campaign can utilize a heavy buy early in its media plan to incite near immediate awareness and build momentum, social media are just the opposite. It can take months for a social media campaign to build awareness (and there are plenty of social media failures that never gained traction). Assuming the plan itself is sound, organizations must be patient while the community embraces the content and the relationship. Although the results may take longer to see, the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the social media model can be well worth the patience and resources required.
* Focus of objectives: it's not uncommon for organizations to focus on action steps rather than desired outcomes from social media. In other words, they take a short-term tactical approach rather than a long-term strategic approach. **An inappropriate objective might read: "Increase engagement by responding to comments on Twitter and Facebook within 24 hours of posting, posting three status updates per business day, and adding links to social media accounts on the corporate blog". Do you see the error? The emphasis is on the action stpes the social media manager will complete (tactical) but there's no focus on what the social media activities should do for the brand. There is no value in doing social media marekting for the sake of social media--the value lies in accomplishing marketing objectives.** Social media are more than the "flavor of the month"--they have the potential to provide lasting and measurable benfits when campaigns are done right.
* Benefits to users: social media live or die on the quality of the content a platform offers to users. That content must add value to the social community. A social media marketing plan answers the question: How will we distribute our content using social media channels? But it also must answer other questions: How can we engage our target audiences in social media communities? What content is valued by our audiences? Do they want content that informs? Entertains? How can we develop an ongoing stream of relevant, fresh content? This should be connected to the experience strategy.
* Measurement: organizations fail to properly measure results. Marketing consultant Tom Peters famously observed, "What gets measured gets done". As social media marketing has developed, some evangelists have encouraged new disciples to keep the faith, emphasizing the growth and and popularity of the media as reason enough to develop a presence in the space. In the long term,  that's just not good enough. for organizations to succeed in social media marketing, measurement is critcal. Measuring outcomes ensures that the organization is learning fromm what worked and what didn't Importantly, as organizations begin to shift more marketing dollars from traditional advertising to social media marketing, managers will seek out comparisons on metrics such as ROI between social media and other media options.

## MANAGINE SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING IN THE ORGANIZATION
* So there we have it--a framework to plan a social media marketing campaign. In Chapter 5, we'll take a closer look at the tactics social media marketers use and how social media teams plan for the daily, weekly, monthly, and annual activities. But social media teams aren' the only employees who play a role in social media. **Other divisions may interact with the social media team to share brand assets, meet information technology needs, address customer concerns, design creative materials, evaluate risk and potential legal liabilities, identify prospects, coordinate sales and special offers.** In other words, social media teams will likely interact with marketing, sales, customer support, information systems, web design, legal, human resources, and finance. In addition, employees can be valuable brand advocates in social media channels. But they can also cause problems. Stories abound of employees who tweeted an insult on an impulse that reflected poorly on the employer brand and harmed customer relationships. To address the roles employees play across the organization, companies rely upon social media policies.

## THE SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY
* Companies need to develop, adopt, and publicize a social media policy among employees. A social media policy is an organizaitonal document that explains the rules and procedures for social media activity for the organizatio and its employees. Just like you, many employees are already engaged in social media. They may be active on social network sites and microsharing tools like Facebook and Twitter. While employees may use social media to communicate with friends and access entertainment opportunities (maybe even when they're supposed to be working!), there's a good chance they will mention their employers and maybe even vent about office politics or shoddy products. Managing that risk is a must for companies. And many companies will recognize that these employees can act as powerful brand ambassadors when they participate in social media. As we mentioned, Zappos takes advantage of teh fact that many of its employees participate in social media vehicles--and these enthusiastic team members promote the company in the process.
* Of course, there's no guarantee that an employee (at least on his or her own time) will necesarily say only glowing things about the company. Brands use formal documents to ensure that the company is protected in a legal sense and also to encourage employees to participate in ways that are consistent with the brand's overall strategy. Here are excerpts from three companies' policies.

* Microsoft: if you plan to tweet about any professional matters (such as about the business of Microsoft or other companies, products, or services, in the same business space as Microsoft), in addition to referencing your alias@microsoft.come email address, whenever possible use the service's profile or contact information to assert that you are a Microsoft employee and/or affiliated with a specific group/team at Microsoft.
* Sun Microsystems: whether in the actual or virtual world, your interactions and discourse should be respectful. For example, when you are in a virtual world as a Sun representative, your avatar should dress and speak professionally. We all appreciate actual respect.
* Intel: consider content that's open-ended and invites response. Encourage comments. You can broaden the conversation by citing others who are bloggin about the same topic and allowing your content to be shared or syndicated...If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront, and be quick with your correction. If you're posting a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post--just make it clear that you have done so.

* The Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA -- now part of the Association of National Advertisers) developed a quick guide to designing a digital social media policy, shown in Table 4.4. Its purpose is to guide how the organization, its employees, and its agents should share opinions, beliefs, and information with social communities. Not only is it good business, it can also help prevent legal problems. The guide encourages organizations to make several decisions and include those in an organization-wide social media policy. Organizations must decide upon:

* Standard of conduct: standards of conduct in a social media policy refer to the basic expectations for employee behaviour in social communities. At a minimum, standards should require that all online statements about the business be honest and trasparent. Deceptive, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims about the organization or its competitors must not be issued. Further, good manners must be used in social communities (no ethnic slurs, personal insults, rumors, lies, or other offensive statements)
* Disclosure requirements: transparency is key in online communities. Employees must disclose that they are affiliated with the organization. If they are receiving material compensation or gifts in exchange for posting, this must be disclosed. Disclosing affiliations ensures that readers can still find the posts credible and trustworthy. Bloggers should include a simple statement: "I received (inserted product name) from (insert company name) and here is my opinion..." In addition, when using posts on social networks, the poster should use hashtags to disclose the nature of relationships reflected in the posts: "#emp (employee/employer), #samp (free sample received), #paid (paid endorsement).
* Standards for posting intellectual property, financial information, and copyrighted information: many of the potential legal problems within social media relate to the inappropriate sharing of information. Organizations should keep all intellectual property and prviate financial information confidential. Prior to posting copyrighted information, appropriate permissions should be collected.

## AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SOCIAL MEDIA
* Who "owns" social media within an organization? Some brand assign the responsibility to a discipline "silo" such as the marketing department, whereas others rely upon a **center of excellence model** that pulls people with different kinds of expertise from across the organization to participate. This eliminates the internal political issues relating to who in the company has primary responsibility for social media so it's easier to integrate social media applications with other marketing initiatives.
* Aside from the organizational structure to support social media marketing efforts, busiensses must make decisions on the level of resources to dedicate. Social media are ongoing conversations across potentially several communication vehicles. Some businesses dedicate multiple employees to manage the conversation calendar, whereas others assign a single person. The organizational task is to assign the least number of resources needed internally and then supplement those resources with help from the organization's social media agency resources.
* There are five basic models for social media structure as shown in Figure 4.5:

* Organic MY: Random nodes connected with each oter
* Centralized: MY: a tree
* Hub and Spoke--Coordinated: MY: One node in the middel connected to many node
* Multiple Hub and Spoke--Dandelion
* Holistic Honeycomb

1. In the centralized structure the social media department functions at a senior level taht reports to the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) or CEO (Chief Executive officer) and is responsible for all the social media activations. The potential problem here is that all social media activity may not be adequately represented. Is customer care going to be good if social media marketing is housed under marketing rather than customer service?
2. In the organic structure no one person owns social media. Instead, all employees represent the brand and work social media into their roles. This is implemented through training and used across the organization. The danger here is that the content can end up off message. Any employee can sign up to respond to customer queries on Twitter. That means the company can not control what employees say. Therefore, the company must have well-developed social media policy in place to guide employee behaviour in social communities.
3. In the hub-and-spoke (also called the coordinated) model, a team of people who are cross functionally trained are ready to address various social media needs. **This is currently the most popular structure for social media management.**
4. The dandelion model is essentially a multi-layered hub-and-spoke model. It is appropriate for companies with strategic busienss units (SBUs) that still represent a core brand.
* The holistic model is currently the least used. it truly refers to a structure within which all employees are empowered to use social media, use social media, and do so according to the company's strategy.

## SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
* Regardless of the structure a company uses or the policy it develops, it must also devise a day-to-day system for managing social media activities, tracking content from mdevelopment to distribution, managing social ad campaigns, analyzing effectiveness, monitoring and listening, and capturing and analyzing social data for market research. Companies may also use vendors to aid in social customer relationship management (CRM), host owned social sites, generate reviews and ratings, facilitate influencer marketing tactics, and provide content. In particular, companies benefit from incorporating cloud services for social media management, social monitoring and listening, social ad management, and social media analytics and modeling. Whether on a small or large scale, one of the most used systems is Hootsuite, Notably, Hootsuite offers a special program for university users that includes an option to become Hootsuite Certified.

## FRAMEWORK FOR STRATEGIC SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* The framework for social media marketing depicting in Figure 4.6 describes an organization's use of social media marketing along four dimensions: 1) scope, 2) culture, 3) structure, and 4) governance.

* Scope: does the organization **use social media marketing internally and externally to collaborate with stakeholders or is social media predominantly limited to use as an external communications channel?** The answer categorizes organizations as defenders, who use social media marketing primarily as a one-way communication tool to entertain consumers or to inform stakeholders, or as explorers, who seek collaboration with many different stakeholders such as clients, employees, and suppliers.
* Culture: is the organization's culture conversative (traditional with a focus on mass communications) or modern (permeable, open, flexible)?
* Structure: are the organization and departmentalization of the social media marketing assignments hierarchical or networked?
* Governance: does the organization define social media regulation and employee practices (autocracy) or allow norms to develop organically (anarchy)?

* Decisions on social media marketing should be guided by the firm's internal influencers (e.g., general vision, mission, corporate goals, corporate culture, available resources), which in turn should be in line with external influencers (e.g., communities, competition, government regulation). The framework doesn't suggest a right or wrong choice. Rather, depending upon the organization's overall strategic focus and stakeholders, social media marketing should be organized for fit and congruence with the organization's design.

### CASE STUDY
221BC'S SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING STRATEGY
* Thus far, we've defined 221BC's social media marketing objectives and its target audience, and identified influencers it could use to help spread its social media message. In Exhibit4.5, you'll see a complete social media marketing strategic plan for 221BC. Note the major components covered in the plan, including objectives, target market personas, the proposed mix of social media zones, channels, and vehicles, the experience strategy, and proposed metrics.

EXHIBIT 4.5
221BC'S SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING STRATEGIC PLAN
* 221BC Kombucha is a family-owned business, founded and operated by Aneta and Eric Lundquist, that brews and distributes traditionally fermented kombucha. The Lundquists, and those passionate about drinking kombucha, believe that it is a gateway food to a healthier lifestyle. 221BC is a date that represents the origin and evolution of ancient wisdom with the innovation of the present; 221BC is using the most traditional methods of kombucha brewing, while marrying those techniques to the most nutritionally dense of the current superfoods. This social media marketing plan will act as a guideline for 221BC to grow and evolve their current social marketing efforts, which are to increase consumption of 221BC Kombucha and, more importantly, to spread the knowledge about the importance of clean eating.
* The plan will evolve from the existing strengths of the brand; that it is healthy, authentic, craft-made, organic, clean, and empowering. In addition, 221BC recently underwent a branding and creative initiative that will be a consistent basis from which to implement the social plan across platforms. The brand's position is "a belief that balance is the key to living a rich life. 221BC balances the authentic health benefits of traditional pungent kombucha with a modern knowledge of herbs and superfoods to create an appealing flavor and pleasurable bevarage experience" (personal communication). The brand's promise to deliver a product that is made using functional herbs and superfoods, by like-minded people trying to spread a healthy lifestyle.

##### SITUATION ANALYSIS
* 221BC currently operates within a small regional market, mostly Florida, in which is a very large and growing competitive kombucha industry. The size of the industry, and commitment to standards, give 221BC opportunities in the competitive landscape. However, the popularity of the product and the growing numberof kombucha products entering the market increase the threat of decreased market share. In addition, some of 221BC's direct competitors are large, national companies like GT's Living Foods and Health-Ade, which have the human and financial resources for large social media marketing initiativs.

##### SWOT
* The following SWOT analysis captures the key strengths and weakness within the company, and describes the opportunities and threats facing 221BC Kombucha.

##### Strenths
* Traditional fermentation used with no shortcuts--only whole ingredients and no substitutes
* 100% family owned and female founded.
* Owners has a tremendous knowledge about gut health, fermentation, and microbiology.
* Have already solidified brand guidelines and a create style guide.
* Content taht is currently on the brand social channels is professional looking and on-brand.

##### Weaknesses
* no current marketing plan due to limited resources and lack of executive direction.
* Current social presence is inconsistent due to restriction on knowledge and resources.
* Product label doesn't tell the full brand story.

##### Opportunities
* The kombucha market is expected to continue to grow, with kombucha becoming seen as a mainstream beverage and an alternative to soda.
* Fill the information gap left by competitors about how kombucha fits into a larger picture of personal health.
* Potential to launch complementary products that align with the goal of promoting health.
* Kombucha popularity means new consumers entering the market.
* More and more competitors are adding supplemental ingredients while 221BC remains pure.

##### Threats
* Kombucha as a trendy drink instead of a lifestyle commitment.
* National kombucha brands have more market value, brand awareness, and social media marketing resources.
* Kombucha is becoming a saturated marekt; competition has increased, price has decreased.
* Acquiring shelf space is expensive and retaining placement is difficult.

### COMPETITIVE AUDIT
* A competitive audit of the national kombucha industry reveals competitors such as GT's, Big Easy, Dr. Brew, and Bauchi--representing just a portion of the market. These competitors focus efforts on the most popular social channels with image-heavy content related solely to the prodct. The long-term issue with this strategy is that these kombucha brand competitors also alter their final product with extracts, concentrates, and other unnecessary ingredients. In addition, these companies are not focused on sharing broader information about why and how kombucha fits into a healthy lifestyle. The future is in real food with understandable and recognizable ingredients, and in companies that care about the health and knowledge base of their curious consumers; 221BC is already positioned to fit into this new food landscape with a social media marketing strategy that promotes this competitive advantage.

### SELF-AUDIT
* 221BC kombucha is active on Facebook and Instagram, as well as Twitter. Content is about what differentiates their product from those of competitors and the company monitors social posts to provide customer service care via social channels. Frequency of posting across channels is inconsistent; 221BC should aim for one post to Instagram a day and at least two stories, one post to Facebook a day with a blog post share and a live video at least once a week, and posting to Twitter at least once a day. In addition to the three social channels listed above, the company has recently launched a blog called Biome 1.0, which is published predominantly by founder Aneta Lundquist. Aneta wants to create and promote deeper social content, beyond the product, to educate and converse with consumers about the driving force behind the use of the product.
* AAall creative imagery flows from t he recently conducted branding initiative--all logos and themes align with brand creative standards. These pre-set creative guidelines will make producing content easier moving forward. 221BC has dabbled in paid/boosted posts but not consistently or well. In the absence of any current broader marketing and communications plan, the company should divert all advertising funds into social (and search) marketing as it is more cost effective and reuslts are easily measured.

### OBJECTIVES
* Because the kombucha industry is anincreasingly competitive market, the goal of the social media marketing plan is to increase brand awareness through social engagement with the brand by creating a sense of community across all channels focused on education regarding shared health and lifestyle interests. The plan will seek to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Promote the brand's image and position as superior to national brands by communicating how the 221BC product is different from those of competitors.
2. Encourage product trials and faciliate purchases by inviting new consumers to try the product
3. Increase brand loyalty by positioning the brand and Aneta as an "expert" --a provider of information related to the proudct by encompassing teh large real food and healthy lifestyl movement.
4. Connect consumers with each other and encourage engagement.

### TARGET AUDIENCE
* From 221BC's own internal customer data and market research, teh company has pinpointed their target audience and created a customer persona called the Conscious Foodie. She is age 30-54, college educated, middle to upper-middle class, physically active, seeking or pursuing a healthy lifestyle, willing to pay more for quality, has kids, reads labels, and tends to be brand loyal. in addition, the Conscious Foodie is digitally connected, seeks out educational content, is mostly on facebook and instagram, and desires interaction with her favorite brands.
* The secondary target audience is known as the College Health Trend Chaser. She is a college student, age 18-25, prefers to buy products "at a deal" but doesn't mind paying more for quality and health, is a fitness nut (espeically trendy fitness like cycling and yoga), and tends to be less brand loyal. The College Health Trend Chaser is more trend driven to drink kombucha and less likely to find value in the health education and lifestyle driven content of the brand's social offering. She is active on Facebook and Instagram, maybe Twitter, maybe Youtube, maybe Tiktik, and is more likely to respond to meme content.
                
### SOCIAL MEDIA ZONES AND CHANNELS
* 221BC will use paid, earned, and owned media in its social marketing plan. Owned media will consist of the brand's website and the newly developed blog content; blog posts should work to educate customers, communicate the brand story, and position Aneta as the brand ambassador and passionate expert on living a healthy lifestyle, gut healthy, and clean eating. Earned media will include social posting and engagement across the company's current channels of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. 221BC will work in video content by using Facebook Live video before committing to starting and managing a Youtube account. Consistency and transparentcy in messaging regarding product ingredients, recipes, and no-string-attached information will help build trust in the earned media target audience. 221BC will use paid media on social channels; boosting posts toward the specified target market on social media will help amplify the message. Search engine optimization (SEO) efforts will also be used. Content centered on paid efforts should promote trial use and repeat purchase of the product, including coupons and offers, as well as giveaways. The brand will also re-approach working with microinfluencers with an audience both geographically and demographically suited to the 221BC target audience in order to grow the brand community.
* Zones utlized will include social community, social publishing, and social commerce. All zones will be used throughut the year and across brand channels. Social community will be used to share the brand truth and to engage with followers. Social publishing will be used to expand content from just product based to the new goal of being a source of education. The social media marketing plan content calendar will incorporate videos, recipes, health tips, blog posts, and more via Aneta herself and possibly the newly created brand personaity the "Bubbly Buddha", which emerged from recent branding sessions. Social commerce will be used to better proliferate coupons, and offers to consumers who aren't yet awwre of the brand or brand loyal, but could be, as well as to encourage current customers to become repeat buyers.
* Strategic objectives are matched with strategy for achieving those objectives and tactical objectives are matched with a tactical strategy and specific tactic employed. 

### Objective One
* Promtoe the brand's image and position the brand as superior to national brands.

* Live video Q&A with Aneta called "Kombucha for Newbies

### Objective Three
* Increase brand loyalty

Strategy
* Position the owners as brand ambassadors and share their story and passion
* Communicate the 221BC company culture through content.

Tactical Objectives
* Make Aneta a brand and lifestyle "expert" on real food and gut health by having her contribute valuable content via the blog and social channels
* Position 221BC as a provider of information beyond the product

Tactics:
* Publish behind the scenes photos and videos so consumers feel like a part of the product
* Create and publish a recipes and tips content series on the blog (cross-posting the content to social media and using social content to drive traffic to the blog)
* Have Aneta converse and interact with followers who engage with her content

Objective Four
* Connect consumers with each other and encourage engagement

Strategy
* Become a wellness brand with engaged community followers, rather than a company
* Create physical spaces for customers to interact, share information, and experience the product
* Cultivate and share user-generate content, especially as responses to brand content

Tactical Objectives
* Increase social engagement across channels by encouraging tagging and sharing
* Use geographical data to invite top engaging followers to popup events

Tactics
* Work with microinfluencers (look for people with lots of engagement within brand followers)
* Create brand partnerships with related products or influencers like fitness gurus
* Involve followers with #FollowFriday; share them using the product or trying the recipes and tips that Aneta shares on the blog
* Use giveaways to grow followers and increase engagement across social channels

## EXPERIENCE STRATEGY
* 221BC's current content types focus on the product, much like their competitors in the kombucha industry. This sort of content doesn't give the consumer much to engage with from an experience standpoint beyond liking the content. The importance of user-generated content is that it elevates messaging on brand-owned channels and mediums that is audience-centric and not brand- or product-centric. Customers should be inspired to engage fully in content, interact with the brand, and generate their own content to share back 221BC. For example, when Aneta shares tips on a recipe she should encourage blog readers to try making the recipe and to share photos of their end product on their channels, taging 221BC so other followers see the posts. In that way, the social content of the 221BC channels grows beyond the goal of being informative and achieves the goal of being an inspiring community with 221BC and Aneta at the center of it.
* The social experience should also invite followers into the inner workings of the 221BC brand, product, and company. This achieves the goals of elevating the quality of the product above competitors, but it also acts as a transparent way for customers to feel more connected to and involved with the product. Not all creative content has to be polished; working off-the-cuff live videos, short clips, and photo into content can often make branded social media channels seem more real and approachable.

## ACTIVATION
* Create a content plan that will outline content themes, types of content, sample titles of posts, and which channel they should be posted on. Work on more social scheduling to take the strain off your timme resources. You should be boosting at least one post on each channel per week and all social posts that link back to the blog should be boosted.

Budget is 5k/month?

Content Calendar--A sample week of what 221BC should be posting

                * Twitter: Last week: blog post (promote)

Thursday
* Take a few minute to converse with followers across channels and answer comments:

                * Instagram: Share a user post highlighting the 221BC product
                * Twitter: Post a Bubbly Buddha health tip

Friday:
* Post the week's blog to the website:
                * Facebook: Latest blog post (promote)
                * Instagram: #FollowFriday (and #TGIF Giveaway bi-weekly)
                * Twitter: Share a recent positive review of the product

Weekend
* Scehdule out weekend posts so you can take a break
* make Saturday and Sunday posts more product based and simplisitic

Monthly:
* Set aside monthly to complete schedule posts for the month ahead
* Monthly blog series call "Benefit of 'Buch"

Quarterly:
* Promote and host a popup social event where consumers/followers can take their virutal engagement to the real world--also frame these events as a chance to get to meet Aneta
* Live video Q&A with Aneta called "Kombucha for Newbies"

##### Measurement
* The effectiveness of the plan will include measurable goals, including metrics that specifically can be tied back to the tactical objectives. Increase followers on the three current main channels of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Increase engagement on posts across the same channels. Monitor specific metrics on brand new initiatives, including an average increase in blog viewership over the first year it's live and average increase in Facebook Live video views over the first six months in implementation. In addition, increase traffic to the website from both social and search. As the social marketing plan evolves, practice social listening and use social analytics to tweak the content, messaing, timing, and budget of the plan on a monthly basis. 221BC should be prepared to access the success of the plan anually and to expand the scope of the plan as the company grows.

### CASE STUDY (CONTINUED)
* In this chapter, we took an in-depth look at a primary competitor, GT's Living Foods. TD's is a powerhouse brand in the kombucha space and one with superior resources for distribution and marketing. For 221BC to stand out among kombucha fans, it must find a way to distinguish its social media engagement from that of GT's Living Foods and other popular kombucha brands. GT's is involved in all four zones of social media marketing. Because 221BC has fewer resources, we've proposed that it concentrate on three zones of social media: social community, social publishing, and social commerce. For social community, the channels will be Facebook and Instagram. Social publishing will utilize a new blog, called Biome 1.0, for which new posts will also be promoted across 221BC's social community channels. Social commerce will play a role in that 221BC will offer coupons to encourage product trial. The experience strategy is tied to 221BC's mission for its kombucha to serve as a gateway to healthier life. For that reason, 221BC's social media content will focus on providing tips and resources for healthier living. When it comes to social media marketing management, Aneta Lundquist is essentially a team of one, but she still uses Hootsuite to schedule posts, follow brands of interest (like GT's) and monitor engagement. We'll look at more of these details as we cover the remaining chapters of the book, including a deep dive into each of the four zones of social media marketing as well as social media metrics and analytics.

5. How do social media teams manage the roles, tasks, and schedules related to executing social media tactics?

## TACTICAL PLANNING FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* In the last chapter you learned how to plan a strategy for a brand's social media marketing. The social media marketing strategic plan may exist independently or may be a sub-plan of an integrated marketing communication plan. When part of a marketing communications (marcom) plan, social media marketing activities will be aligned with other marcom elements such as advertising and sales promotions to amplify the brand's message and/or to activate campaign events. Consequently, many of the tactical decisions mentioned in this chapter, such as establishing brand persona and identifying a creative strategy to guide brand communications, may already be determined. The stories that relay the brand meaning to the target audiences along with existing brand assets may be in place and ready for the social media team to use as a base. Even for new brand launches, brand identity, the pillars that will serve as the foundation for the brand's image and position, and the value proposition it promises to deliver, will be defined as part of the brand's strategic marketing planning process.
* In this chapter, you will learn the process for developing a tactical plan. The **tactical plan** brings the social media marketing strategy to life. There are several practical steps required, **including determining the right channels, content to deliver the desired experience, rules of engagement, and schedule. As if that's not enough, we must also develop processes to create, produce, and deliver the content, conversation, and other experiential elements of our strategy.** In other words, we will address the why, who, where, what, when, and how of social media marketin. With this foundation for how social media marketing is accomplished from a practical perspective, you will see how the strategic decisions interplay as we cover the zones, strategies, and tactical decisions in depth in the next section of teh book.

## WHY: VALUE-DRIVEN SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING
* **Social media tactic** are the actions taken to execute the social media strategy. **The strategy considers the situation analysis, target audience, and objectives to guide the zones of social media that the brand can best use to reach and engage the target audience. The tactic will guide the brand's activities in the zones of social media marketing, but must do so in a way that fits with the objectives. The objectives are the why--the reasons or purpose for social media marketing.** Table 5.1. reviews possible objectives, the strategy for achieving the objective, and possible tactics. As we saw in earlier chapters, there are several possible marketing objectives that brands use social media marketing to address. The table uses a few of these to demonstrate how we map strategic objectives and strategies to tactical objectives and tactics.

## WHO: UNDERSTANGING AND HONORING THE TARGET AUDIENCE
* Target audience research is a key component of the strategic social media marketing planning process. It provides the insight needed to devise an experience strategy capable of engaging the target audience in the zones of social media. **Engage** is a key word because of the culture of social media. Remember social media are about participation and sharing. The cultural expectation is that participants will interact, co-create, and share, and this expectation exists for consumers as well as for brand participants. For this reason, a social media strategy should be based on an experience. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines experience as 1) direct observation of or participation in events as a basis of knowledge, 2) the fact or state of having been affected by or gained knowledge through direct observation or participation. The Cambridge Dictionary defines experience as the process of getting knowledge or skill that is obtained from doing, seeking, or feeling. **If marketers are to be effective at engaging people, we need to understand what experience might inspire action--inspire the audience to do, see, and/or feel.** Likewise, target audience research will guide decisions of where and when. It will provide guidance on the social media networks and channels the target audience uses as well as the activities they participate in, when they participate, the devices they use, the people and brands they engage, and more. The persona is the characgter description that highlights key information about the target audience. Chapter 2 reviewed the elements of personas in depth and that information became part of the strategic planning process covered in Chapter 4. Here we reply on personas again. It's useful to review the persona or revise it to reflect insights that will guide tactical decisions. Figure 5.1 provides a template for a persona focused on guiding social media tactics.

                What are Their Favorite Types of Social Content?

## WHERE: THE CHANNEL PLAN
* The next decision determines where the brand will engage with the target audience. For simplicity, we are reviewing the process for tactical planning as a linear one. In reality, these decisions are considered in tandem. The culture, guidelines and rules, and functionality (as well as charactertistics of the population membership) of each prospective **channel** will influence **what can and should be shared, how people engage with each other, and choices about the timing and frequency of participation.** In this step, each channel is evaluated for fit. Some of the questions that will facilitate channel selection include the following:

* **Who uses this channel, what are they using it for, and how much time do they spend here?**
* **What are conversations like here? What kinds of content work best here?**
* **Will participation in this channel help us meet our objectives? Does it make sense for our business to use this channel?**
* **What specific goals can be pursued here given the channels' functionlity? Does these goals relate to objectives in our strategic plan?**
* **Can we establish a unique presence and make a valuable contribution to the community? Does our brand image, voice, and tone fit with the **channel culture?**
* **Are our competitiors present here? If so, how are they performing?**
* **If we participate in this channel, what will we contribute? What will we ask fans and followers to do when they engage with us and after engagements? Share? Comment?**
* **Does the channel offer paid media options to ensure audience reach and the ability to target specific audience segments?**

* The characteristics of each channel should be considered. Remember there are several possible **social media channels**. We mention those with the large audiences and aoption rates for marketers, but there are thousands of options available. Depending upon the target audience, the industry, and the objectives for social media, smaller, niche, channels may be effective. Table 5.2 provides an overview of the characteristics associated with several major channels.
* The answers to the questions posed and the evaluation of the characteristics of the channels will facilitate the creation of a **channle plan**. **Table 5.3 illustrates a sample channel plan. It identifies the vehciles the brand will use to reach and communicate with the target audience and summarize the tactics that are recommended for each vehicle. Channel selection influences subsequent decisions on the topics and types of content the brand will create and publish, as well as the volume of brand activity and the forms of engagement the brand will use. Keep in mind that these choices must take in account available resources. The size of the social media team and the budget available for social media marketing will influence the number of channels, the types of content, the sources of content, and the volume and frequency of distribution and promotion of content.**

===

* Some channels work for both B2B and B2C marketers, while some (like LinkedIn) are best for one more than the other. This is reflected in the channel choices made by B2B and B2C marketers, as shown in Figure 5.2. Channel plans will include any owned media options and paid media purchased on social media sites as well. Figure 5.3 shows the extent of marketers' use of paid media on social media sites

## WHAT: DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE
* What will the brand ask the target audience to do? The answer to this question is the basis for the experience the brand will offer the audience. It must not only enable participation and sharing by virtue of its design, but should inspire the audience to participate and share. It must be consistent with the brand's image and be valuable to the audience. For this reason, the ideal experience can be thought of as one that **captures the sweet spot at which the audience's passions and needs intersect with the brand's identity**. Like advertising, **it must be able to attract attention, break through a clutter, deliver the intended message, and aid comprehension and recall, while positively influencing brand attitudes and purchase intent**. Wait, there's more! It should be **discoverable** so that the brand appears during relevant searches. It should be **authentic** and **conversational** to fit the culture of social media. Finally, it should be **scalable** and **sustainable**. Table 5.4 lists the characteristics of effective social media tactics. That's quite a challege! Perhaps it's no wonder that so little social media marketing efforts earn audience engagement.

* Interactive
* Targeted
* Value-driven
* Authentic
* Participatory
* Distinctive
* Purpose-Driven
* Discoverable
* Symbolic
* Functional
* Experiential
* Inviting

* The design of the experience therefore encompasses several elements: 1) type of **tactic**, 2) **content type**, and 3) **content strategy**, including themes, topics, appeals, source, and style.

## TYPES OF TACTICS
* The experience the brand offers the target audience should align with the relevant zone of social media marketing. In other words, in the zone of social community, the experience should build relationships and will likely include conversation and sharing. In the zone of social publishing, the experience should be informative and/or educational. In the zone of social entertainment, the experience should be entertaining. In the zone of social commerce, the experience is related to shopping and buying. Some tactics are cross-zone while others are not. Table 5.5 describes the tactics marketers use to achieve experience strategies and the related zones of social media. You'll learn more about these tactics as we cover each zone of social media in depth in the next section of the book.

# PART IIIL THE Four Zones of Social Media

# CHAPTER 6: SOCIAL COMMUNITY
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. How do social networking communities enable user participation and sharing?
2. In what ways can brands utilize social networking communities for branding and promotion?
3. How can brands reach consumers organically using social network sites? What characteristics do brand fan exhibit?
4. What forms of paid media can be used in social communities? Why is paid media important to social media marketers?

## THE SOCIAL COMMUNITY ZONE
* In this chapter we drive deeper into the zone of social community, the first zone in our model, shown in Figure 6.1. Recall that all zones in the social media mix are built on social networks, technologically enabled, and based on the principles of shared participation.
* As we plan ,we want to devise a way to encourage customers to participate and to share and to do so within the zones within which we operate. What will invite participation and sharing? That's our experience strategy. Where will they participate and share? Within the zones. Of course, we may use any of the four zones. But in this chapter our focus is on the first zone, the zone of social community. Let's think of zone 1 as the relationship acquiring and maintaining relationships above all else. Conversation and collaboration are the principal activities in this zone, though we often converse and collaborate around content, whether provided by brands, suers, or others. Brand encourage this participation through engagement.

                FIGURE 6.1: Social COmmunity Zones
                Social Community:
                        * Sharing
                        * Socializing
                        * Conversing
                Social Publishing:
                        * Editorial
                        * Commercial
                        * User-Generated
                Social Entertainment:
                        * Games
                        * Music 
                        * Art
                Social Commerce
                        * CRM/Service
                        * Retailing/Sales
                        * Human Resources

* Social network sites are the community vehicles that house and enable social engagement. Facebook is the juggernaut of social networks, with the most members worldwide.
*  Social networks are the foundation of social media because every form of social media is based on participation from a community of members. Still, it is useful to compare and contrast social networks and to understand how their defining dimensions affect our ability to market brand within the social space. This is particularly relevant as we see a trend toward users utilizing more social channels for specialized purposes. Social network sites all maintain the basic network structure we discussed in Chapter 3--nodes that interact with one another, flows between node members, and graphs connected to others by way of node relationships. However, social network sites vary in terms of three important dimensions:

                1. Audience and degree of specialization
                2. The social objects that mediate the relationship among members
                3. Degree of openness

### AUDIENCE SPECIALIZATION
* Social network sites can be internal or external, general or specialized. Internal sites are those a specific organization builds for its own use and limits to members of the organization. Rather than hosting several subcultures within a large social network site, an **internet social network** provides a method of communication and collaboration that is more dynamic and interactive. This is a lot like the intranet that many companies provide their employees. Many companies use an enterprise social network as the foundation for their internal, private social netowkr. Enterprise platforms include Workplace by Facebook, Jive, and Yammer. Research shows that the use of ESNs is valuable for engaging employees, building meaningful connections, and enhancing communication. Microsoft uses a network it calls TownSquare, IBM has the BeeHive, and Yahoo! employees meet in the Backyard. In contrast, some external social networks are sponsored by brands.
* Social networks are, of course, about networking--participating in the kinds of activities that enable members to build and maintain their relationships with other people. However, the nature of those relationships also affect the characterization of the social network. Linkedin is a professional social network that emphasizes career experience and the need to maintain connections to those we know professionally. The primary benefit is to be able to call upon one's network when looking for a consultant, employee, job, or other career-related search. There are several professional networks held together by industry, purpose, and personal career goals. Care2 is a social network for people who want to help with social cuases. Focus is a network for business and technology experts. Den provides a social network where architects and designers congregate.
* Just because a social network focuses on personal relationships over professional ones doesn't necesarily mean that it has a broad target. For instance, Jdate.com is a dating social network for Jewish singles. Its mission is social, but it still targets a niche audience. There are several networks designed around specific target audiences defined by demographic charactertic, including age, marital status, income and so on.

### SOCIAL OBJECTS AND PASSION-CENTRIC SITES
* In industry terms, sites designed around object sociality, the ability of an object to inspire social interaction, are known as **vertical networks**. The term describes the narrow, deep focus of social network sites that differentiate themslves because they emphasize some common hobby, interest, or characteristics that draws members to the site. These vertical networks do not attract the same traffic typical of general sites, but one might argue that the members are more involved because of the common interest that initally brought them to the site. They function much like so-called niche markets in the physical world; this term refers to marketplaces that offer a relatively small number of items to buyers who tend to be loyal to these outlets.

### OPENNESS
* Social network sites can be closed, gated communities entirely controlled by the vendor that offers the platform. At the other extreme they can be accessbile to any members or developers who wish to participate. many SNS require new members to register for membership and to use login specifications to access the community. It often makes sense for a social network site to keep a record of membership even if anyone is allow to join. This information can be invaluable for purposes of member management, product development, promoting the site, and utilizing the member data for other purposes. how might social networks utilize member data? it becomes a source for big social datasets, which we covered in Chapter 2. Because social networks have access to vast amounts of detailed data about members' preferences, friends, and activities, they can offer highly targeted ad placements for advertisers. Social network sites may eventually license that data external marketers who could use the data to target potential customers. For now, the social community site with the most data, Facebook, isn't selling member data, but some speculate that it will.
* Marketing in the zone of social community doesn't have to mean marketing on Facebook. But Facebook is the most popular SNS for marketers. Why? That's where the consumers are. Of course, there are other SNS, and brands can build their own online brand communities (OBC), but **social netowrking fatigue** and **social lock-in** help Facebook maintain its dominance. Fatigue is higher when people manage multiple community accounts. The steady streams of content flowing from multiple networks, reaching us even with mobile notifications, add to this sense of fatigue. Social lock-in occurs when a user is unable to transfer social contacts and content from one social network to another. For example, Parler is an alternative to Twitter but its growth is limited by social lock-in.
* One widely discussed solution is to develop a system of **identity portability**  such that a single profile would provide access across social network sites with a single login and shared information. This is the goal of **OpenID**, an authentication protocol that works across participating sites. Unfortunately, OpenID works only on OpenID-enabled sites, limiting the portability for users. Sites can also choose to enable authentication with Facebookk Connect, an option that has been more widely adopted.

## SOCIAL NETWORK ACTIVITIES
* Engagement is the currency of social network sites. How do we interact with others on social media platforms? We addressed this question in Chapter 2. But especially for the zone of social community, the answer has three parts. We mingle, we chat, and we share.
* We can think of social networks as communication hubs; virtually all of them offer users access to a contact list and an interface that makes it easy for people to talk to one another. However, most sites offer more features than these basic ones. The new standard for social network sites is to offer tools, widgets, applications, and features that encourage **social sharing**; sites provide people with the tools they need to reveal elements of their digital identities. These elements include information about us or things that we create--such as our opinions, photos, videos, songs, and artworks. They may also take the form of **secondary content**--things that others create which we feel are worth redistributing to our social networks, such as retweets, links to a celebrity blog, or even brands we "like" on our Facebook page. Mark Zuckerberg, president and CEO of Facebook, said this about sharing: "People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. This is social norm that has evolved over time".
* Social media empower us because all have the capacity to share something if we choose to do so. Some users are creators; they actively produce content in the form of video, podcasts/music, stories and articles, and blog posts. They may publish their own website. Creators are a busy bunch--more than 24 hours of Youtube video is posted every minute. The rest of us may not possess the technical skill or the desire to produce original content. We're happy leaving that work to others--many of whom are professionals. Still, we certainly are avid consumers of the content--Youtube videos along get billions of views every day.
* Remember that analysts estimate that lurkers--those people who consume content by reading posts and watching videos, but who do not contribute to the flow of content--**make up about 90% of any online community**. Although not everyone is a creator who develops artifacts such as videos and podcasts for distribution in their social network, anyone can join a network, update a status, post secondary content from others, and provide feedback on the content others post in their networks. the act of sharing changes this dynamic, because even lurkers can redistribute secondary content to a larger network of people. In this sense even fairly passitve participants can extend their reach well beyond their own social graph. ShareThis, a provider of a widget that enables visitors to easily share content they discover online, found that though almost half of users preferred email for sharing interesting content with others, most of the remainder preferred to use a social media channel to share. Applications such as ShareThis minimize the investment of time and effort necessary to share secondary content on a social network, so it's more likely that content will spread rapidly. This is one of the reasons marketers are attracted to social media as a communication channel. The viral spread of content amplifies the brand's reach, potentially delivering millions of impressions beyond what would have been possible without social sharing.
* A study of social media users found that 75% of people are likely to share content via social media channels. The top three reasons people share content "socially" are because they find it interesting and/or entertaining, they think it could be helpful to others, and to get a laugh. Although the content can be virtually anything you can send in digital form, most people reported sharing family pictures and video, news about family and friends, funny videos, news articles and blog posts, and coupons and discounts.

## MARKETING APPLICATIONS IN THE SOCIAL COMMUNITY ZONE
* As we discussed earlier, the social community zone focus on relationships. Brands can leverage paid, earned, and owned media options in social network sites to meet several marketing objectives, including promotion and branding, customer service and customer relationship management, and marketing research. In social network sites, brands can purchase paid space for advertising and utilize share technologies to further leverage the value of the advertising impressions. They can stimulate earned media, brand-related word-of-mouth communication, by participating and embedding the brand in social communities. Brands seeking a deeper connection to social media users can sponsor a social community or create a dedicated OBC, a form of owned media affect the search engine ranking delivered by search engines such as Google and yahoo! So not only can consumers be influenced by brand interactions and references to brands made by those in their network, they also can be led to branded content via search listings. That's a topic we'll cover further in Chapter 7 when we discuss search engine optimization.

## SOCIAL PRESENCE: BRANDS AS RELATIONSHIP NODES
* Brands must create a **brand profile** within the selected social networking communities in which they wish to command a presence. In this way, the brand acts as a node in the network's social graph. Doing so increases the opportunities for interactions with customers and prospects and also encourages people to talk about the brand with each other.
* Wehn a brand launches a profile on social network sites, the brand exists much as people do on the sites. Just the mere presence of a brand on a social network site results in more positive brand attitudes. Friends can interact with the brands; share information, photos, and videos; and participate in two-way communication. As we discuss in Chapter 4, brands may participate as a corporate entity, as one or more people representing the brand, or as a mascot. Whichever the choice, the brand will develop a profile actor, it should "stay in character". In so doing, the brand is personified. **Brand personification** is defined as "imbuing trademrked or otherwise propietary-named products and services with a human form and/or human attributes, including a general distinctive phyiscal appearance and personality". Even brand mascots, also known as spokescharacters, can achieve the benefits of personifcation. A **brand mascot** is a fictional persona with a distinct personality created to represent a brand; it may include animated characters (e.g., GEICO's gecko) as well as human actors portraying spokescharacters (e.g., Flo for Progressive Insurance). Note that mascots differ from spokespeople, who are human beings endorsing the brand and not a brand-specific invention.
* Building brand personas strengthens brand personality, differentiate brands from competitors, and sets the stage for a perceived relationship. It is a natural expansion of trend for brands to create personalities for themselves, both through the use of creative language--including style, imagery, tone, and creative appeals--and music. Consumers perceive personified brands as active contributors in dyadic relationships. We can see this in the higher engagement rates earned by brands that reinforce their persona in social media. Consumers also respond positively to brand mascots, treating the brand mascots like humans (known as an anthropomorphic response) in their interactions with the brands in social communities.
* Assuming the brand's persona is likeable and credible, it can facilitate **message inernalization** (the process by which a consumer adopts a brand belief as his or her own). When it comes to likeability, brand mascots may be a perfect fit. In addition to physical characteristics, the dimensions of spokescharacter likeability include personality, humor, and consumer experiences. All are dimensions that can serve as a foundation for engaging social media participation.
* What does it take to devise a good brand persona? Brand personas should be consistent with the brand's style guide. Social media are still components of an integrated marketing communications program and, as such, the decision made for the brand's style will still apply. The "voice" of the brand in social channels will need to be consistent, whether the approach is humanized, mascot, or corporate. The social media aspects of the style guide will enable multiple people to create content and converse with fans in the role of the brand. It will ensure that brand representation is consistent. It will include indicators like brand personality traits.
* The personality and fit with the brand overall are clear in all social media communications. Brian Solis (2011), author of Engage!, recommend that brand managers build the brand's social media persona on a foundation of eight decisions:

1. What are the brand's core values?
2. What are the brand's pillars, or social objects that illustrate these values?
3. What has the brand promised to its customers?
4. What are the brand's aspirational attributes?
5. What traits are associated with the brand?
6. What opportunities exist?
7. How does the brand align with the company's overall culture?
8. What stories can help bring the brand's personality to life.

* There is a lot of clutter and fragmentation in social media. It can be hard for a brand's voice to be heard. There are sevearl applications that can help brands analyze their social profiles and identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. Some examples incude Meltwater and Mention.
