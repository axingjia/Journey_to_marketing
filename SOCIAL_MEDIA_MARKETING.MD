# Chapter 1: The Social Media Environment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
* When you finish reading this chapter, you will be able to answer these questions:
1. What are social media? How are social media similar to, yet different from, traditional media?
2. How does the Social Media Value Chain explain the relationships among the Internet, social media channels, social software, and the Internet-enabled devices we use for access and participation?
3. What are the major zones of social media that make up the channels, modes, and vehicles for social media participation?
4. What is social media marketing? What marketing objectives can organizations meet when they incorporate social media in their marketing mix?

## IT's A SOCIAL WORLD
* When you woke up this morning, what was the first thing you did? Sure, you may have taken a moment to gulp down some juice or coffee, but odds are you also checked your mobile for texts that came in overnight. Maybe you set you Snapchat Story. Perhaps you scrolled through a few tweets or checked WhatsApp. You certainly aren't along: one survey of people from 31 countries reported 96% of them use their smartphone within an hour of waking up, often before they get out of bed.
* Face it--you're a digital native. If you're a typical student, you probably can't recall a time when the Internet was just a static, one-way platform that transmitted text and a few sketchy images. The term digital native originated in a 2001 article by Marc Prensky (2001) titled "Digital natives, digital immigrants." He tried to explain a new type of student who was starting to enter educational institutions. These students--students like you--were born in an era in which digital technology has always existed. You and your fellow digital natives grew up "wired" in a highly networked, always-on world. It's an exciting time--but it continues to change so constantly that we need to study it carefully.
* Today the Internet is the backbone of our society. Widespread access to connected devices like personal computers, digital video and audio recorders, webcams, smartphones, and wearables like smartwatches ensures that consumers who live in virtually any part of the world can create and share content. Worldwide, there are about 4.38 billion global Internet users today--that's roughly 57% of the world's population. Most Internet users, about 45% of the world's population, are active on at least one social network. That's about 3.5 billion people. Of course, social media penetration does vary by global region, with the lowest penetration rates reported in Central Asia, Africa, and South Asia. Even these areas are expected to experience growth, at least in part due to Internet access via mobile phone. Mobile penetration is 67% worldwide and 63% of mobile users are active on social media via mobile applications. Curious about social media usage in a specific country? We Are Social, a global social media marketing agency, provides data on every country in the world in its Digital Yearbook. Odds are you already participate in this wired world.
* Information doesn't just flow from big companies or governments down to the rest of us; today each of us communicates with huge numbers of people by a click on a keypad, so information flows across people as well. The fundamental change in the way we live, work, and play is characterized in part by the prevalence of social media. **Social media are the online means of communication, conveyance, collaboration, and cultivation among interconnected and interdependent networks of people, communities, and organizations enhanced by technological capabilities and mobility.** Does that sound like a complex definition? It is...because social media exist within a complex and rapidly advancing environment. We'll dive deep into the social media environment, but first let's explore the making of a social media life--your life.

## LIVING A SOCIAL (MEDIA) LIFE
* The Internet and its related technologies make what we know today as social media possible and prevalent. Every day the influence of social media expands as more people join online communities. The average Internet user has accounts within eight different social media services and spend more than two hours a day on social media. Facebook, a social utility that offers synchronous interactions (which occur in real time, such as when you text back and forth with a friend) and asynchronous interactions (which don't require all participants to respond immediately, such as when you email a friend and get an answer the next day), content sharing of images, video, music, games, applications, groups, and more, has at the time of writing more than 2.2 billion active users worldwide. What's more--more than 1 billion of those users are mobile users. If Facebook were a country, it would be the most populated in the world. Do you wonder why Facebook is called a social utility? A community that got its start as a social network, Facebook offers functionality far beyond basic relationship building. It not only competes with social channels ranging from video and photo sharing to blogs; its Facebook Live, Marketplace, and Campaign ensure it competes with e-commerce sites, news sources, and other advertising media channels. Facebook also owns the top two social messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messanger, as well as the top photo- and video- sharing network, Instagram.
* people aren't just joining social communities. They are contributing, too! Let's take Youtube as an example. Youtube users (Youtube has around 2 billion users) upload more than 300 hours of video every single minute of every day. That's roughly equivalent to 1,500,000 full-length movies uploaded weekly. Youtube hosts local versions in more than 100 countries and users can navigate Youtube in 80 different langues. It's perhaps not surprising then to learn that Youtube users watch more than a billion hours of video each day (and more tahn half watch on mobile devices). Google the phrase "social media stats" and you'll see mind-boggling facts and figures about the number of people who use social media, what they're doing (and when) with social media, and their reach and influence. This has been done for you in Table 1.1. And take a look at Figure 1.1 an infographic that highlights fun facts about some of the most popular social sites.

        Table 1.1: Mind-Boggling Social Media Stats
        * It took radio 38 years to reach 50 million listeners. TV took 13 years to reach 50 million users. The Internet took 4 years to reach 50 million people. In less than 9 months, Facebook added 100 million users
        * Just over 13% of Facebook users are in North America; more than a third of users are in the Asia Pacific region
        * More than 90% of companies use Linkedin as their primary recruiting tool
        * The top Youtuber, like PewDiePie and Lily Singh, earn millions of dollars each year
        * Generation X (ages 35-49) spend the most time on social media--6 hours and 58 minutes per week. Millennials (age 18-34) come in second, spending 6 hours and 19 minutes of their time per week on social networks
        * Two-thirds of Internet users worldwide use social media
        * While Facebook dominates in size and penetration worldwide, Instagram dominates in user engagement. Brands see a median engagement of 0.09% per Facebook post, in comparison of 1.60% median engagement rate per post on Instagram 
        * QQ, Webchat, and Qzone, social networks with heavy user bases in Asia, are more popular than Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest

* When we introduce the definition of social media earlier, we admitted it's a complicated idea. It's difficult to fully capture the realm of social media because of the expansive nature of sites, services, and behaviours that are a part of this rapidly expanding digital universe. There are simply too many social websites, too many things we can do online, and increasing access using a variety of devices to grasp it all at once.
* More generally, however, we can think of social media as the way digital natives live a social life. To sum thigns up, it's all about a culture of participation; a belief in democracy; the ability to freely interact with other people, companies, and organizations; open access to venues that allow users to share content, fromm simple comment to reviews, ratings, photos, stories, and more; and the powr to build on the content of others from your own unique point of view. Here's just a brief look at some of the things you might do with social media:

* Share and document an event using live video.
* Watch television while discussing the program on social media.
* Create a blog to share your favorite recipes
* Coordinate a book club meeting and negotiate a group discount on the book's purchase price
* Mobilize a group of people to protest against an unpopular policy on your campus
* Instant message or voice chat with friends to carry on a synchronous conversation online.
* Share an infographic with your friends.
* Locate the best vegan restaurant in a city you're visting for the first time based upon reviews by other vegans
* Make your own animated video and share it
* Keep a travel diary of a trip abroad complete with photos , videos, journal entries, and destination ratings.
* Raise money for a charity or even find backers for a startup company who are willing to fund part of your costs.
* Find people you use to know and reconnect with them.
* Entertain yourself and your friends with short social games

* The list could go on and on. Our point? Social media enable active participation in the form of communicating, creating, joining, collaborating, working, sharing, socializing, playing, buying, and selling, and learning within interactive and interdependent networks. Thus, social media are interactive and participartory. It's an exciting time to be around!
* While social media users have embraced social media, its infrastructure has developed in ways that have made social media pervasive and ubiquitous. Social media intersects with websites, platforms, and media devices. The result is that people today live in what can be thought of as an omnisocial world.

## THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
* The environment of social media is like a volcano that suddenly erupts within warning. Within a few short years we've seen an ever-expanding domin of activities, channels, technologies, and devices that are changing how we think about our lives (e.g., in the old days a "friend" was someone you actually knew in person!) As a student of social media marketing, recognizing the parameters of the field and how the pieces of the puzzle fit together will benefit you as you develop skill as devising social media strategies and tactics. The Social media Value Chain, shown in Figure 1.2, organizes this complex environment into its core components.

        Figure 1.2
        * Infrastructure
        * Channels/Hosts
        * Supporting Software and Services
        * Devices
        * Share-Create-Talk-Work-Buy/Sell-Learn

* The value chain illustrates the core activites of social media participants and the components that make those activities possible. As a social media user, you are empowered to participate in any way you'd like, from just "lurking" on a site to scripting, filming, and uploading your own video stories. Those activities are made possible by the underlying infrastructure of social media's techno-social system. just as in the physical world where we need infrastructure in the form of roads, railroads, TV transmitters, and trained people to operate and maintain these structures, in digital environments the pieces that make up the social web are crucial. These include the web, the social channels and vehicles, the software that provides the programming we need in order to carry out these activites, the device (iPad, smartphones, computers) we use, and of course the parcipants--the people and organizations whose contribution porvide the content we all access. Let's take a closer look at each of these elements.

## THE WEB AS PLATFORM
* Just as the Internet is a foundation for the web, the web is the foundation for social media. Because social media are not possible without this infrastructure, it is the first supporting component we identify in the Social Media Value Chain. To put it simply, the Internet is a network of connected data servers. Initially, th web (what we now call Web 1.0) was a network of connected information. People browsing the Internet were merely consumers of the Internet's most static contents. Web 1.0 was the era of cognition, in which a network of data producers served information to primarily passive consumers. Web 2.0 marked a major shift by connecting networks of people in addition to networks of information. Tim O'Reilly (2005), founder of O'Reilly media and the first to define Web 2.0 explained Web 2.0 as "development in online technoology that **enable interactive capabilities in an environment characterized by user control, freedom, and dialogue."** Web 2.0 offered a cost-effective solution that provides access to rich data; the collective wisdom of its users, access to micromarkets; software that operates on multiple platforms (mobile phone, personal digital assistant, computer) and beyond (cloud computing); and user interaces that are easy, accessbile, and interactive.
* From these advances blossomed the "social web" and an era of communication, in which networks of networked communities have members who participate as consumers, creators, and co-creators. Each additional user adds value for all users. Economists refer to this as a **network effect**. Amazon's ability to recommend books to you based upon what other people with similar interests bought in the past gets better as it tracks more and more people who enter search queries and make purchases. When you're visiting a new city and want to find a great restaurant on Yelp, you feel more comfortable with a place that 1000 diners recommend than one that only ten users rate. You get more value from Facebook as more of your friends also use the network. Network effects enable organizations to leverage the value of **crowdsourcing**, a process that harnesses the collective knowledge of a large group of people to solve problems and complete tasks. Organizations use crowdsourcing to benefit from the collective wisdom of crowds, but the network effect ensures that there is sufficient participation for the crowdsourced solution to be a good one.
* Web 3.0, the **Semantic Web**, is the expected next stage. First envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee, this iteration of the web makes it possible for people and machines to collaborate. The web will be a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange. It will mark an era of collaboration--not only of people, but also of people and machine. In other words, devices (yes, machines) will be contextually, socially, and network aware and be able to dynamically create social connections between each other and connected people in order to offer services to each other and to jointly solve problems. In other words, social media will eventually serve to support **collective intelligence**. while some elements of Web 3.0 exist--especially the presence of services made possible by social software, the capture of user-generated data, and the mining and processing of the data--it is not yet fully realized. We remain in a stage known as Web 2.x.

## SOCIAL CHANNELS
* Social channels are the networks and platforms that support social media functionality and connections. We cover these in the section of the Zones of Social Media

## SOCIAL SOFTWARE
* So far we've learned that the social media environment supports many activities. But much of our experiences and what we are able to create or do online is due to a host of **social software** applications. These are computer programs that enable users to interact, create, and share data online. For virtually everything you'd like to do online, there is a social software program (or several) that can help you. **Interested in planning an event? Use an event planner and invitation service like eVite.com.** Want to keep a notebook of wedding ideas that you can share with your bridesmaids? use Evernote.com, or create a board of hot new wedding gown styles on Pinterest (watch out for those hideous bridemaids' dresses). Need to keep a new feed of all the latest happenings at your school? Use Paper.li or Google Alerts. Want to create an e-book to share on Linkedin? Use Designerr. Social software can facilitate interation, content creation, sharing, syndicating, saving, analyzing, filtering, sorting, and searching data online. Such tools are certainly useful to individuals, communities, entrepreneurs, and businesses. Examples include mixir (for producing live radio shows and podcasts), Xtranormal (for video production), and Prezi (for presentation).
* You've heard of the phrase "There's an app for that!" It's no wonder given that there are currently more than 1.2 billion apps available through digital stores like Google Play. Those apps, also known as widgets (usually downloadable or embeddable), are types of social software. In addtion to apps, social software also encompasses application service sites that we call social services. Importantly, social sofware exist to facilitate all social media channels. There are applications for social community activities, publishing, entertainment, and commerce. Importantly, these apps largely enable mobile connectivity to our social spaces and activities. Blurring things further, open application programming interface (APIs) and other platform technologies have enabled countless third-party websites to integrate with social network sites. A more recent development is the chatbot, an artificial intelligence computer software program that simulates intelligent conversation via written or spoken text using a chat interface, such as Facebook Messanger or Webchat. Chatbot can provide a number of conversational services ranging from functional to fun.
* Social software also operates behind the scenes in ways that affect your social media experience. Social sites use complex mathematical formulas called algorithms to personalize the content you see in your news feed, recommend friends connections, and more. Dominique Cardon, author of What Are Algorithm Dreaming of? likens algorithms to a recipe in that they are a series of instructions that produce a desired result. When you browse nearby restaurants on your phone, view movie recommendations on Netflix, or check Youtube on how-to videos, algorithms likely played a role in the outcome.

## DEVICE
* Devices are pieces of equipment we use to access the Internet and the range of activities in which we participate online. We utilize connected hardware devices like tablet PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, Internet-connected game consoles, traditional laptops and desktops, and even televisions for social media access. As a consumer, we may focus primarily on connected devices like smartphones and other smart devices, especially those that provide mobile access to social media. Globally, 93.4% of social media users participate using a mobile device. Today's smart devices also include refrigerators, thermostats, and even cars. Wearables are smart devices that can be carried or worn on one's body. They measure and capture data, which can then be stored, shared, and further processed. Fitness wearbles like Fitbit, which measure activity levels and share the information with online communities, have experienced the most adoption thus far, but they represent a small portion of wearable devices. For instance, Snapchat Spectators, camera-equipped sunglasses, enable users to take video and upload it to Snapchat with the touch of a button.
* Even devices that aren't "smart" on their own can become so by using an Internet of Things gateway. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a paradigm in which all the object around us could be connected anytime and anywhere. Gateways are devices that can facilitate connection for objects without network capabilities. So far most applications are industrial, but expect to see consumer applications in surprising areas. Absolut, the vodka company, is experimenting with manufacturing its bottles as IoT-enabled objects! Smart devices are a first step in the evolution toward connecting machines as users, alongside people in social media. Ultimately, social connection among machines will transform them from passive data-collecting devices into active members of a thriving digital ecosystem, capable of creating social connections, solving problems, and offering services.

## PEOPLE
* Social media work only when people participate, create, and share content. Journalists, editors, and publishers still matter in social media, but so do every day individuals. You see this visualized in Figure 1.2 as a series of activities typical in social media participation. This is why we hear so much about citizen journalists (amateurs who post about newsworthy events) and citizen advertisers (people who share their iews about a product or service even though they're not affiliated with the company). Bloggers represent a unique hybrid form of "netizens" in that they may create and share content professionally or personally. Publishing a blog is surely a bigger commitment to sharing content than is posting a status update to your Facebook wall, but both actions generate content and add value to the social media environment. Still, people aren't the only actors in social media. As a techno-social system, other participants include businesses and brands, government organizations, community groups, media companies, content producers, and so on.
* Our coverage of the Social media Value Chain isn't complete without a review of social channels and related vehicles in and through which social media participation takes place. We address these channels, known as the zones of social media, next.
