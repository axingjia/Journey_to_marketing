# CHAPTER 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

## INTRODUCTION

### Consumer Behaviour: People in the Marketplace
* This book is about people like you. It concerns the products and services you buy and use and the ways these purchases fit into your lives. This introductory chpater briefly describes some important aspects of the field of consumer behaviour and some of the essential explanations for how people interact with the marketing system.
* For now, though, let's look at one "typical" consumer: you. This brief discussion allows us to highlight some aspects of consumer behaviour that will be covered in the rest of this book.

* As a consumer, you can be described and compared with other individuals in a number of ways. For some purposes, marketers might find it useful to categorize you in terms of your age, sex, income, or occupation. These are some examples of objectively measurable descriptive characteristics of a population, or demographics. In other cases, marketers would rather know something about your interests in clothing or music, or the way you spend your leisure time. This sort of psychological information comes under the category of psychographics, which can include aspects of a person's lifestyle, interests, attitudes, values, and personality. Knowledge of consumer demographics and psychographics plays an extremely important role in many marketing applications, such as defining the market for a product or deciding upon the appropriate techniques to employ when targeting a certain group of consumers.
* Your purchase decisions are heavily influenced by the opinions and behaviours of your friends. A lot of product information, as well as recommendations to use or avoid particular brands, is transmitted by conversation among real people rather than by way of TV commercials, magazines, billboards, or even bizarre websites. The web has created thousands of online consumption communities where members share views and product recommendations about anything from airline loyalty programs to iPhone apps. The bonds among peer groups are cerented by the products they use in common. There is also pressure on each group member to buy things that will meet with the group's approval, and there is often a price to pay in the form of group rejection or embarrassment when one member does not conform to others' conception of what is good or bad, "in" or "out".
* As members of a large society, people share certain cultural values or strongly held beliefs about the way the world should be structured. Other values are shared by members of subcultures, or smaller groups within the culture, such as French Canadians, teens, "prairie people", or even Hell Angels.
* When examining websites, you are exposed to many competing brands. There might be numerous sites that do not capture your attention at all, while there are others that you barely notice or reject because they do not fit the "image" with which you identify or to which you aspire. Using market segmentatino strategies means targeting a brand only to a specific group of consumers rather than to everybody--even if it means that other consumers will not be interested in or may even deliberately avoid that brand.
* Brand often have clearly defined images or "personalities" created by prodcut advertising, packaging, branding, and other marketing strategies that focus on positioning a product a certain way. The choice of a favourite website is very much a lifestyle statement: it says a lot about what a person is interested in as well as sommething about the type of person he or she would like to be. people often choose a product because they like its image or because they feel that its personality somehow corresponds to their own. Moreover, consumers may believe that when they buy and use the product or service its desirable qualities will "rub off" onto them.
* When a product succeeds in satisfying a customer's specific needs or desires, it may be rewarded with many years of brand loyalty, a bond between product and consumer that is very difficult for competitors to break. Often a change in the consumer's life situation or self-concept is required to weaken this bond and thus create opportunities for competitors.
* Consumers' evaluations of products are affected by the products' appearance, taste, texture, or smell. We may be swayed by the shape and colour of a package as well as by more subtle factors such as the symbolism used in a brand name, in an advertisement, or even in the choice of a cover model for a magazine. These judgments are affected by--and often reflect--how a society feels that people should define themselves at that point in time. If asked, you might not even be able to say exactly why you considered some websites and rejected others. many product meanings are hidden below the surface of t he packaging and advertising, and this book will discuss some of the methods used by marketers and social scientists to discover or apply these meanings.
* Our opinions and desires are increasingly shaped by input from around the world, which is becoming a much small place because of rapid advancements in communications technology and transportation systems. In today's global culture, consumers often prize products and services that "transport" them to different places and allow them to experience the diversity of other cultures--even if only to watch others brush their teeth.

### What is Conumser Behaviour
* The field of consumer behaviour covers a lot of ground: It is the study of the processes involved when individuals or group select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs and desires. Consumers take many forms, ranging from an eight-year-old child begging her mother for a Monster High doll to an executive at a large corporation choosing a multimillion-dollar computer system. The items that are consumed can include anything from **canned peas to a massage, democracy to hip hop, and even other people (e.g., the images of rock stars)**. Need and desires to be satisfied range from **hunger and thirst to love, status, or even spirtual fulfillment**. And, as we'll see throughout this book, people can get passionate about a broad range of products.

#### Consumer Behaviour is a process
* In its early stages of development, the field of consumer behaivour was often referred to as buyer behaviour, **reflecting an emphasis on the interaction between consumers and producers at the time of purchase. Marketers now recognize that consumer brhaviour is an ongoing process, not merely what happens at the moment a consumer hands over money or a credit card and in turn receives a good or service.**

        Some issues that arise during stages in the consumption process

        | | Consumer Perspective | Marketer's perspective
        |---| ---| ---|
        | Prepurchase issues| How does a consumer decides that he or she needs a product? What are the best sources of information to learn more about alternative choices | How are consumer attitude toward products formed and changed? What cues do consumers use to infer which products are superior to others? |
        | Purchase Issues | Is acquiring a product a stressful or pleasant experience? What does the purchase say about the consumer? | How do situational factors, such as **time pressure or store displays**, affect the consumer's purchase decision?
        | Postpurchase Issues | Does the product provide pleasure or perform its intended function? How is the product eventually disposed of, and what are the environmental consequences of this act? | What determines whether a consumer will be satisfied with a product and whether he or she will buy it again? Does this person tell others about his or her experiences with the product that affects their purchase decisions?

* The exchange, in which two or more organizations or people give and receive something of value, is an integral part of marketing. Although exchange is an important part of consumer behaviour, the expanded view emphasizes the entire consumption process, which includes the issues that influences the consumer before, during, and after a purchase.

## CONSUMERS' IMPACT ON MARKETING STRATEGY
* Why should managers, advertisers, and other marketing professionals bother to learn about consumer behaviour? Very simply, understanding consumer behaivour is good business. A basic marketing concept states that **firms exist to satisfy consumers' needs. These needs can be satisfied only to the extent that marketers understand the people or organizations that will use the products and services they are trying to sell--and do so better than their competitors.**
* **Consumer response is the ultimate test of whether a marketing strategy will succeed.** Thus, **knowledge about consumers is incorporated into virtually every facet of a successful marketing plan**. **Data about consumers help marketers define the market and identify threats to a brand and opportunities for it.** And, **in the world of marketing, nothing is forever.** This knowledge also helps ensure that the product continues to appeal to its core market. The purpose of understanding consumer behaviour is to predict the future. **Anyone can see what is happening at present, but in consumer behaviour we are also focused on tomorrow.** Throughout this book, we will highlight takeaways from consumer behaviour for marketers in boxes entitled "Marketing Insight".

### Segmenting Consumers
* The process of marketing segmentation identifies groups of consumers who are similar to one another in one or more ways and then devises marketing strategies that appeal to one or more groups. As our society evolves from a mass culture in which many consumers share the same preferences to a diverse one in which we have almost an infinite number of choices, it's more important than ever to identify distinct market segments and develop specialized messages and products. It's also important to deliver those specialized messages through diverse channels.
* As we'll see later, building loyalty to a brand is a very smart marketing strategy,so sometimes companies define markets segments by identifying their most faithful customers or heavy users. For example, in the fast-food industry the loyal user accounts for only one of five customers but for about 60 percent of all visits to fast-food restaurants. Aside from frequent use of a product, there are many dimensions that can be used to slice up a larger market.
* As we've already seen, demographics are statistics that measure observable aspects of a population, such as birth rate, age distribution, and income. Statistics Canada is a major source of demographic data on families. This informaiton is available at www.statcan.gc.ca. The changes and trends revealed in demographic studies are of great interest to marketers, because the data can be used to locate and predict the sizes of markets for many products, ranging from home mortgages to brooms and can openers. Imagine trying to sell baby-food to a single male, or an around-the-world vacation to a couple making $15000 a year!
* Table 1-1 below provides a statistical snapshot of the "typical" Canadian consumer, based on data compiled from Statistics Canada. As you go down this list, you will quickly see that many characteristics do not apply directly to you. How different are you from this consumer?

        Table 1-1: A Statistical Picture of the Average or Typical Canadian Consumer
        * The typical Canadian is a woan who is 39.9 years old.
        * The average Canadian worked approximately 36.4 hours per week in 2011
        * The average income of a Canadian was approximately $840 per week in 2011.
        * In 2010, the average Canadian household spent $14,997 on shelter
        * In 2010, the average household spent $894 on personal care
        * The average household spent $3452 on clothing purchases in 2010
        * The average household spent $3539 on recreation in 2010
        * The average Canadian watched 20.06 hours of television per week in 2010.

* In consumers' personalities, attitudes, values, and lifestyles. For now, let's summarize a few of the most important demographic dimensions, each of which will be developed to more detail in later chapters.

###### AGE
* Consumers of different age groups obviously have very different needs and wants. Although people who belongs t o the same age group differ in many other ways, they tend to share a set of values and common cultural experiences that they carry throughout life. **In some cases marketers initially develop a product to attract one age group and then try to broaden its appeal later on.** That's what the energy drink Red Bull has done. Red Bull was originally introduced in bars, nightclubs, and gyms to the product's core audience of young people. Over time, the drink became popular in other contexts, and now the company is sponsoring the PGA European Tour to broaden its reach to older individuals. It's also handing out free cans to commuters, cab drivers, and car-rental agencies to market the drink as a way to stay alert on the road.

###### GENDER
* Many products, from fragrances to footwear, are targeted at either men or women. Differentiating by gender starts at a very early age--even diapers are sold in pink versions for girls and blue for boys. An all-female marketing team at Procter & Gamble, who jokingly call themselves "chicks in charge", introduced Crest Rejuvenating Effects, the first mass-market toothpaste positioned just for woemn. P&G communicates that this product is feminine when the company packages it in teal tube nestled inside a glimmering "pearlescent" box. The toothpaste is sparkly, teal-toned, and tastes like vanilla and cinnamon.

###### FAMILY STRUCTURE AND LIFE STAGE
* A person's family structure and marital status is another important demographic variable, because it has such a big effect on a consumer's spending priority. Young singles and newlyweds are the most likely to exercise, go to bars, concerts, and movies, and consume alcohol. Families with young children are big purchasers of health foods and fruit juices, while single-parent households and those with older children buy more junk food. Home maintenance services are most likely to be used by older couples and dual-career couples.

###### SOCIAL CLASS AND INCOME
* People grouped within the same social class are approximately equal in terms of their incomes and social standing in the community. They work in roughly similar occupations, and they tend to have similar tastes in music, clothing, art, and so on. They also tend to socialize with one another and share many ideas and values regarding the way life should be lived. The distribution of wealth is of great interest to marketers because it determines which groups have the greatest buying power and market potential.

###### ETHNICITY
* Multiculturalism and Canada go hand in hand. This country comprises immigrants from all over the globe. Canada accepts nearly 1 million immigrants and refugees every four years, by far the highest per capita rate of immigration in the world. We are diverse in our languages and in the cultural consumption that stems from our different ethnicities. For example, English is now a minority language in Vancouver. The growth of the Asian market in Canada has led to trilingual labeling of some products. Since Canadians blend together from many different racial and cultural backgrounds, we also blend together in our consumption heritage, as signified by food. As a culture, we are just as likely to enjoy eating sushi as pyrophy (a.k.a perogies) or lasagna.

###### GEOGRAPHY
* The climate changes drastically from region to region in Canada, which makes segmenting some products by region obvious. For example, more snow blowers and fur coats are sold east of the Rocky Mountains, more umbrellas and raincoats to the west. Humidifiers and dehumidifiers are a must in regions around the Great Lakes. On the Prairies, it is not unusual for people to have two or more freezers in their basements; many people who live in farming regions preserve the food they produce for winter and year-round consumption.
* Within regions, there are some different cultural pockets and hence differences in food tastes. New Brunswick has teh highest consumption of sliced white bread, while Alberta leads in bubblegum sales. Most corn flakes are sold on t he Prairies, and linguini has its highest sales in Toronto. Quebecers consume the least amount of frozen french fries, preferring the real thing.

###### LIFESTYLES: BEYOND DEMOGRAPHICS
* Consumers also have very different lifestyles, even if they share other characteristics such as gender or age. The way we feel about ourselves, the things we value, the things we like to do in our spare time--all of these factors help determine which products will push our buttons, or even those that will make us feel better. As one example, the car company VM decided to market to consumers who followed the MTV program Pimp My Ride and enjoyed the activities involved in restoring into trickled-out street machines. To do so, they released a series of online viral ad videos featuring a German engineer and his assistant "unpimping" autos belongs to those that enjoy this specific lifestyle. By poking fun, the VM brand attracted individuals to watch the ad and pass it along to others with similar interests.

### Relationship Marketing: Building Bonds with Consumers
* **Marketers are carefully defining customer segments and listening to people in their markets as never before. Many of them have realized that a key to success is building relationships that will last a lifetime between brands and customers.** Relationship marketing involves making an effort to interact with customers on a regular basis, **giving them reasons to maintain a bond with the company over time.** Tony Roma's, a rib restaurant, practises the notion of relationship marketing in a very simple way--by sending regular customers a coupon for their birthdays that entitles them to free meal at the restaurant.

### MARKETING'S IMPACT ON CONSUMERS
* Does marketing imitate life or vice versa? After the movie The Wedding Crashers becam a big hit, hotels, wedding planners, and newlyweds reported an outbreak of uninvited guests who tried to gain access to parties across the United States. For better or for worse, we all live in a world that the actions of marketers and the media significantly influence. Throughout in this book, we will highlight the ways in which marketers influence consumers in boxes entitled "Consumers in Focus".
* We are surrounded by marketing stimuli in the form of advertisements, stores, and products competing for our attention and our dollars. Marketers filter much of what we learn about the world, whether through the affluence they depict in glamorous magazines or the roles actors play in commercials. Ads show us how we should act with regard to recycling, alcohol consumption, and even the types of houses and cars we wish to own. In many way we are also "at the mercy" of marketers, since we rely on them to sell us products t hat are safe and that perform as promised, to tell us the truth about what they are selling, and to price and distribute these products fairly.

#### Marketing and Culture
* Popular culture, consisting of the music movies, sports, books, celebrities, and other forms of entertainment consumed by the mass market, is both a product and an inspiration for marketers. Our lives are also affected in far-reaching ways, ranging from how we acknowledge cultural events such as marriage, death, or holidays to how we view social issues susch as air pollution, gambling, and addition. The Stanley cup, holiday shopping, federal elections, container recycling, and tweeting are all examples of products and activities that touch many lives.
* This cultural influence is difficult to overlook, althoough many people do not seem to realize how much of their views of the world around them--their movie and musical heroes, the latest fashions, food and decorating choices, and event the physical features they find attractive or ugly in men and women--are affected by marketers. For example, consider the product icons that marketers use to create an identity for their products. Various mythical creatures and personalities--from the Pillbury Doughboy to Sasquatch--have been at one time or another central figures in popular culture. In fact, it is likely that more consumers could recognize such characters than could identify past prime ministers, business leaders, or artists. Although  the characters never really existed, many of use feel as if we "know" them, and they certainly are effect "spokecharacters" for the products they represent.
* Consumer-generated content, in which consumers themselves voice their opinions about products, brands, and companies on blogs, podcasts, and social networking sites such as Facebook, and even film their own commercials that thousands view on sites such as Youtube, is also an important part of marketing's influence on culture. Doritos has utilized consumer-generated ads in their Super Bowl advertising since 2006, and these ads often score top honours as the ad that the most vieweres remember. Videos like the one for Rebecca Black's song "Rriday" have shown that anyone can product content that, even if strongly disliked by the majority of consumers, finds its way into the broader North American culture.

#### The Meaning of Consumption
* One of the fundamentla premises of the modern field of consumer behaviour is **that people often buy products not for what they do but for what they mean.** This principle does not imply that a product's basic function is unimportant, but rather that the roles products play in our lives go well beyond the tasks they perform. And the deeper meanings of a product may help it to stand out from others, similar goods and services. Other things being equal, a person will choose the brand that has an image (or even a personality) consistent with his or her underlying needs.
* For example, although most people probably couldn't run faster or jump higher if they were wearing Nike shoes as opposed to Adidas,  many diehard loyalists swear by their favourite brand. These arch-rivals are largely marketed in terms of their images--meanings carefully crafted with the help of legions of rock stars, athletes, and slickly produced commercials--and many millions of dollars. So when you buy a Nike "swoosh", **you may be doing more than choosing footwear; you may also be making a lifestyle statement about the type of person you are or want to be. For a relatively simple item made of leather and laces, that's quite a feat!**
* Our allegiances to particular sneakers, musicians, or soft drinks help us define our place in modern society, and these choices also help us form bonds with others who share similar preferences. This comment by a participant in a focus group captures the curious bonding that can be caused by consumption choices: " I was at a Stanley Cup party, and I picked up an obscure drink. Somebody else across the room went "Yo!" because he had the same thing. People feel connection when you're drinking the same thing.

#### The Global Consumer
* The majority of people on Earth live in urban centres. In fact, the number of megacities, defined as urban centres of 10 million people or more, is projected to grow to 26 in 2015. Already, China boasts four shopping centres that are larger than the massive West Edmonton Mall, and within five years it will be home to seven of the world's largest malls. One by-product of sophisticated marketing strategies is the movement toward a global consumer culture, in which people around the world are united by their common devotion to brand-name consumer goods, movie stars, and celebrity.
* We owe much of this interconnectedness to developments in technology that allow us to link with companies--and with each other--regardless of our phsyical location. U-commerce is the use of ubiquitous networks, whether in the form of wearable computers or customized advertisements beamed to us on our cell phones ("Hey, you're walking by McDonald's. Come on in for today's burger special".), that enable real-time connecitons in business and consumption behaviour.
* Many products already carry a plastic RFID tag containing a computer chip and a tiny antenna that lets the chip communicate with a network. Grocery items will tell  the store what needs to be restocked and which items and past their expiration dates, and your house will know when you're pulling in the driveway as it turns on the lights and starts your favourite tunes spinning before you walk in the door. Already IBM has introduced "smart" washers and dryers in some college and university dorms that let students keep tabs on their laundry from anywhere they can access the Internet--their dorm rooms, the library, or cell phone. Student can log onto a webpage to see if any machines are free and receive an email or text when their load is finished.
* The rise of globa marketing means that even smaller companies are looking to expand overseas--and this increases the pressure to understand how customers in other countries are the same as or different from the customers in the host country. In the restaurant industry, for example, Shakey's pizza restaurants are mushrooming in the Philipines, and food from the International House of Pancakes is selling like hotcakes in Tokyo. But menu changes are sometimes called for to please local palates: Schlozsky's in Malasia offers Smoky Mountain Chicken Crunch with "half-virgin" chicken, and diners in Bob's Big Boy in Thailand snap up Tropical Shrimp, deep fried with "exotic breading". This book pays special attention to the good and bad aspects of this cultural homogenization.

###### VIRTUAL CONSUMPTION
* Electronic marketing increases convenience by breaking down many of the barriers caused by time and location. You can shop 24 hours a day without leaving home and you can find a product online at an e-tailer in another country and order it for delivery--whether you are at home or somewhere else around the globe.
* And it's not all about business selling to consumers (B2C commerce). In addition, virtual consumption has greatly facilitated consumer-to-consumer activity (C2C commerce). Just as e-consumers are not limited to local retail outlets in their shopping they are not limited to their local communities when looking for friends.
* Picture a small group of local collectors who meet once a month at a local diner to discuss their shared interests over coffee. Now multiply that group by thousands, and include people from all over the world with a shared passion for sports memorabilia, Barbie dolls, Harley-Davidson motorcycles, refrigerator magnets, or massively multiplayer online games such as WOW. These are examples of virtual brand communities.
* The Web also provides an easy way for onsumers around the world to exchange informatio nabout their experiences. Sites like RottenTomatoes.com, retail sites like Amazon.com, and RatemyProfessors.come enable consumers to share their thoughts and feelings on everything from movies, to books, to the professor they had last semester.
* If you're a typical student, you probably can't recall a time when the Internet was just a static, one-way platform that transmitted text and a few sketchy images. The term digital native originated to describe students that have grown up "wired" in a highly networked, always-on world where digital technology had always existed. Today the Internet is the backbone of our society. Widespread access to device like personal computers, digital video and audio recorders, webcams, and smartphones ensures that consumers or practically any age and who live in virtually any part of the world can create and share content. But information doesn't just flow from big companies or governments down to the people, today to the people; today each of us can communicate with huge numbers of people by a click on a keypad, so information flows across people as well.
* That's what we mean by a **horizontal revolution**. This horizontal revolution is characterized in part by the prevalence of social media. Social media are the online means of communication, conveyance, collaboration, and cultivation among interconnected and interdependent networks of people, communities, and organizations enhanced by technological capabilities and mobility.
* Facebook, the largest social media platform, offers synchoronous interactions (ones that occur in real time, as when you text back and forth with a friend) and asynchronous interactions (ones that don't require all participants to respond immediately, as when you text a friend and get an answer the next day), photo sharing, games, applications, groups, e-retailing, and more, and currently has more than 845 million active users. if Facebook were a country, it would be the third-most-populated in the world. And people aren't just joining social communities, they are contributing too! Youtube users upload more than 35 hours of video every minute of every day. That's roughly equivalent to 176,000 full-length movies uploaded weekly. In just 30 days on Youtube, more video is broadcast than in the past 60 years on CBS, NBC, and ABC broadcasting networks combined. Consider these mind-boggling social media stats:

                * If you were paid $1 for every time an article was posted on Wikipedia, you would earn $156.23 per hour
                * It took radio 38 years to reach 50 million listeners. TV took 13 years to reach 50 million users. The Internet took four years to reach 50 million people. In under nine months, Facebook added 100 million users.
                * About 70 percents of Facebook users are outside the United States
                * Social media activity has overtaken porn as  the number one online activity.
                * One out of eight couples married last year met using a social media site
                * Eight percent of companies use Linkedin as their primary recruiting tool
                * Twenty-fve percent of search results for the world's top ten brands are to user-generated content.
                * More than 1.5 million pieces of content are shared on Facebook daily.
                * Eight percent of Twitter usage is from mobile devices, and 17 percent have tweeted while on the toilet.

* This is all exciting stuff, especially because social media platforms enable a culture of participation--a belief in democracy; the ability to freely interact with other people, companies, and organizations; open access to ventures  that allows users to share content from simple comments to reviews, ratings, photos, stories, and more; and the power to build on the content of others from one's own unique point of view. Of course, jsut as with democracy in the real world, we have to take the bitter with the sweet. There are plenty of unsavoury things going on in cyberspace, and the hours people spend on Facebook, on online gambling sites, or in virtual worlds such as Second Life, have led divorce, bankruptcy, or jail in the real world.

### Markting Ethics and Public Policy
* In business, conflicts often arise between the goal of succeeding in the marketplace and the desire to conduct business honestly and to maximize the well-being of consuemrs by providing them with safe and effective products and services. Accordingly, many universities and corporations are now focusing very intently on teaching and reinforcing ethical behaviour.

###### BUSINESS ETHICS
* Business ethics are essentially rules of conduct that guide actions in the marketplace--the standards against which most people in a marketplace judge what is right, wrong, good, or bad. These universal values include honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, respect, justice, integrity, concern for others, accountability, and loyalty.
* Ethical business is good business. Consumers think better of products made by firms they feel are behaving ethically. But jsut what is ethical behaviour? Sometimes it's not so easy to tell. For example, when you download songs from Kazaa or other filesharing programs, are you stealing? The film and recording industries think you are!
* Notions of right and wrongs do differ across people, organizations, and cultures. Some businesses, for example, believe it is all right for salespeople to persuade customers to buy even if it means giving them false information, while other firms feel that anything less than total honesty with customers is terribly wrong. Because every culture has its own set of values, beliefs, and customs, ethical business behaviours are defined quite differently around the world. For example, one recent study found that because of differences in values (more on this in Chapter 6). Mexican firms are less likely to have formal codes of ethics and more likely to bribe public officials than are Amercian or Canadian commpanies. On the other hand, different attitudes about work and interpersonal relationship mean that Mexican companies are also more likely to treat lower-level employees better than do their NAFTA partners to the north.

###### PRESCRIBING ETHICAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
SKIM

### NEEDS AND WANTS: DO MARKETERS MANIPULATE CONSUMERS
* One of the most common and stinging cricisms of marketing is that marketing techniques (especially advertising) are responsible for convincing consumers that they "need" many material things and that they will be unhappy and somehow inferior people if they do not have these "necessities". The issue is a commplex one and is certainly worth considering: Do marketers give people what they want, or they tell people what they should want?

##### Subheader: Do Marketers Create Artificial Needs?
* The marketing system has come under fire from both ends of teh political spectrum. On the one hand, some believe that advertising contributes to the moral breakdown of society by presenting images of hedonistic pleasure, thus encouraging the pursuit of secular humanism. On the other hand, some argue  that the same deceitful promises of material pleasure function to buy off people who would  otherwise be revolutionaries working to chnage the system. Through advertising, the system creates demand that only its products can satisfy.
* One such response to this argument is that **a need is a basic biological motive, while a want represents one way society has taught us to satisfy that need**. For example, while thirst is biologically based, we are taught to want Coca-Cola to satisfy that thirst rather than, say, goat's milk. **Thus, the need is already there; marketers simply recommend ways to satisfy it. A basic objective of advertising is to create awareness that these needs exist, rather  than to create the needs.**

#### Subheader: Are Advertising and Marketing Neccessary?
* As social critic Vance Packard wrote: "large-scale efforts are being made, often with impressive success, to channel our unthinking habits, our purchasing decisions, and our thought processes by the use of insights gleaned from psychiatry and the social sciences". The economist John Kenneth Galbraith felt that radio and TV are important tools to accomplish this manipulation of the masses. Since virtually no literacy is required to use these media, they allow repetitive and compelling communications to reach almost everyone. This criticism may be even more relevant to online communications, where a simple click delivers a world of information us.
* **Goods are arbitrarily linked t o desirable social attributes. One influential critic even argued that the problem is that we are not materialistic enough; that is, we do not sufficiently value goods for the utilitarian functions they deliver but instead focus on the irrational value of goods for what they symbolize.** According to this view, for eample, "beer would be enough for us, without the additional promise that in drinking it we show ourselves to be manly, young at heart, or neighbourly."
* One response to this particular argument is that products are designed to meet existing needs, and **advertising merely helps to communicate the products' availability**. According to the economics-of-information perspective, advertising is an important source of consumer information
