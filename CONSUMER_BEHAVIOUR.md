# CHAPTER 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

## INTRODUCTION

### Consumer Behaviour: People in the Marketplace
* This book is about people like you. It concerns the products and services you buy and use and the ways these purchases fit into your lives. This introductory chpater briefly describes some important aspects of the field of consumer behaviour and some of the essential explanations for how people interact with the marketing system.
* For now, though, let's look at one "typical" consumer: you. This brief discussion allows us to highlight some aspects of consumer behaviour that will be covered in the rest of this book.

* As a consumer, you can be described and compared with other individuals in a number of ways. For some purposes, marketers might find it useful to categorize you in terms of your age, sex, income, or occupation. These are some examples of objectively measurable descriptive characteristics of a population, or demographics. In other cases, marketers would rather know something about your interests in clothing or music, or the way you spend your leisure time. This sort of psychological information comes under the category of psychographics, which can include aspects of a person's lifestyle, interests, attitudes, values, and personality. Knowledge of consumer demographics and psychographics plays an extremely important role in many marketing applications, such as defining the market for a product or deciding upon the appropriate techniques to employ when targeting a certain group of consumers.
* Your purchase decisions are heavily influenced by the opinions and behaviours of your friends. A lot of product information, as well as recommendations to use or avoid particular brands, is transmitted by conversation among real people rather than by way of TV commercials, magazines, billboards, or even bizarre websites. The web has created thousands of online consumption communities where members share views and product recommendations about anything from airline loyalty programs to iPhone apps. The bonds among peer groups are cerented by the products they use in common. There is also pressure on each group member to buy things that will meet with the group's approval, and there is often a price to pay in the form of group rejection or embarrassment when one member does not conform to others' conception of what is good or bad, "in" or "out".
* As members of a large society, people share certain cultural values or strongly held beliefs about the way the world should be structured. Other values are shared by members of subcultures, or smaller groups within the culture, such as French Canadians, teens, "prairie people", or even Hell Angels.
* When examining websites, you are exposed to many competing brands. There might be numerous sites that do not capture your attention at all, while there are others that you barely notice or reject because they do not fit the "image" with which you identify or to which you aspire. Using market segmentatino strategies means targeting a brand only to a specific group of consumers rather than to everybody--even if it means that other consumers will not be interested in or may even deliberately avoid that brand.
* Brand often have clearly defined images or "personalities" created by prodcut advertising, packaging, branding, and other marketing strategies that focus on positioning a product a certain way. The choice of a favourite website is very much a lifestyle statement: it says a lot about what a person is interested in as well as sommething about the type of person he or she would like to be. people often choose a product because they like its image or because they feel that its personality somehow corresponds to their own. Moreover, consumers may believe that when they buy and use the product or service its desirable qualities will "rub off" onto them.
* When a product succeeds in satisfying a customer's specific needs or desires, it may be rewarded with many years of brand loyalty, a bond between product and consumer that is very difficult for competitors to break. Often a change in the consumer's life situation or self-concept is required to weaken this bond and thus create opportunities for competitors.
* Consumers' evaluations of products are affected by the products' appearance, taste, texture, or smell. We may be swayed by the shape and colour of a package as well as by more subtle factors such as the symbolism used in a brand name, in an advertisement, or even in the choice of a cover model for a magazine. These judgments are affected by--and often reflect--how a society feels that people should define themselves at that point in time. If asked, you might not even be able to say exactly why you considered some websites and rejected others. many product meanings are hidden below the surface of t he packaging and advertising, and this book will discuss some of the methods used by marketers and social scientists to discover or apply these meanings.
* Our opinions and desires are increasingly shaped by input from around the world, which is becoming a much small place because of rapid advancements in communications technology and transportation systems. In today's global culture, consumers often prize products and services that "transport" them to different places and allow them to experience the diversity of other cultures--even if only to watch others brush their teeth.

### What is Conumser Behaviour
* The field of consumer behaviour covers a lot of ground: It is the study of the processes involved when individuals or group select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs and desires. Consumers take many forms, ranging from an eight-year-old child begging her mother for a Monster High doll to an executive at a large corporation choosing a multimillion-dollar computer system. The items that are consumed can include anything from **canned peas to a massage, democracy to hip hop, and even other people (e.g., the images of rock stars)**. Need and desires to be satisfied range from **hunger and thirst to love, status, or even spirtual fulfillment**. And, as we'll see throughout this book, people can get passionate about a broad range of products.

#### Consumer Behaviour is a process
* In its early stages of development, the field of consumer behaivour was often referred to as buyer behaviour, **reflecting an emphasis on the interaction between consumers and producers at the time of purchase. Marketers now recognize that consumer brhaviour is an ongoing process, not merely what happens at the moment a consumer hands over money or a credit card and in turn receives a good or service.**

        Some issues that arise during stages in the consumption process

        | | Consumer Perspective | Marketer's perspective
        |---| ---| ---|
        | Prepurchase issues| How does a consumer decides that he or she needs a product? What are the best sources of information to learn more about alternative choices | How are consumer attitude toward products formed and changed? What cues do consumers use to infer which products are superior to others? |
        | Purchase Issues | Is acquiring a product a stressful or pleasant experience? What does the purchase say about the consumer? | How do situational factors, such as **time pressure or store displays**, affect the consumer's purchase decision?
        | Postpurchase Issues | Does the product provide pleasure or perform its intended function? How is the product eventually disposed of, and what are the environmental consequences of this act? | What determines whether a consumer will be satisfied with a product and whether he or she will buy it again? Does this person tell others about his or her experiences with the product that affects their purchase decisions?

* The exchange, in which two or more organizations or people give and receive something of value, is an integral part of marketing. Although exchange is an important part of consumer behaviour, the expanded view emphasizes the entire consumption process, which includes the issues that influences the consumer before, during, and after a purchase.

## CONSUMERS' IMPACT ON MARKETING STRATEGY
* Why should managers, advertisers, and other marketing professionals bother to learn about consumer behaviour? Very simply, understanding consumer behaivour is good business. A basic marketing concept states that **firms exist to satisfy consumers' needs. These needs can be satisfied only to the extent that marketers understand the people or organizations that will use the products and services they are trying to sell--and do so better than their competitors.**
* **Consumer response is the ultimate test of whether a marketing strategy will succeed.** Thus, **knowledge about consumers is incorporated into virtually every facet of a successful marketing plan**. **Data about consumers help marketers define the market and identify threats to a brand and opportunities for it.** And, **in the world of marketing, nothing is forever.** This knowledge also helps ensure that the product continues to appeal to its core market. The purpose of understanding consumer behaviour is to predict the future. **Anyone can see what is happening at present, but in consumer behaviour we are also focused on tomorrow.** Throughout this book, we will highlight takeaways from consumer behaviour for marketers in boxes entitled "Marketing Insight".

### Segmenting Consumers
* The process of marketing segmentation identifies groups of consumers who are similar to one another in one or more ways and then devises marketing strategies that appeal to one or more groups. As our society evolves from a mass culture in which many consumers share the same preferences to a diverse one in which we have almost an infinite number of choices, it's more important than ever to identify distinct market segments and develop specialized messages and products. It's also important to deliver those specialized messages through diverse channels.
* As we'll see later, building loyalty to a brand is a very smart marketing strategy,so sometimes companies define markets segments by identifying their most faithful customers or heavy users. For example, in the fast-food industry the loyal user accounts for only one of five customers but for about 60 percent of all visits to fast-food restaurants. Aside from frequent use of a product, there are many dimensions that can be used to slice up a larger market.
* As we've already seen, demographics are statistics that measure observable aspects of a population, such as birth rate, age distribution, and income. Statistics Canada is a major source of demographic data on families. This informaiton is available at www.statcan.gc.ca. The changes and trends revealed in demographic studies are of great interest to marketers, because the data can be used to locate and predict the sizes of markets for many products, ranging from home mortgages to brooms and can openers. Imagine trying to sell baby-food to a single male, or an around-the-world vacation to a couple making $15000 a year!
* Table 1-1 below provides a statistical snapshot of the "typical" Canadian consumer, based on data compiled from Statistics Canada. As you go down this list, you will quickly see that many characteristics do not apply directly to you. How different are you from this consumer?

        Table 1-1: A Statistical Picture of the Average or Typical Canadian Consumer
        * The typical Canadian is a woan who is 39.9 years old.
        * The average Canadian worked approximately 36.4 hours per week in 2011
        * The average income of a Canadian was approximately $840 per week in 2011.
        * In 2010, the average Canadian household spent $14,997 on shelter
        * In 2010, the average household spent $894 on personal care
        * The average household spent $3452 on clothing purchases in 2010
        * The average household spent $3539 on recreation in 2010
        * The average Canadian watched 20.06 hours of television per week in 2010.

* In consumers' personalities, attitudes, values, and lifestyles. For now, let's summarize a few of the most important demographic dimensions, each of which will be developed to more detail in later chapters.

###### AGE
* Consumers of different age groups obviously have very different needs and wants. Although people who belongs t o the same age group differ in many other ways, they tend to share a set of values and common cultural experiences that they carry throughout life. **In some cases marketers initially develop a product to attract one age group and then try to broaden its appeal later on.** That's what the energy drink Red Bull has done. Red Bull was originally introduced in bars, nightclubs, and gyms to the product's core audience of young people. Over time, the drink became popular in other contexts, and now the company is sponsoring the PGA European Tour to broaden its reach to older individuals. It's also handing out free cans to commuters, cab drivers, and car-rental agencies to market the drink as a way to stay alert on the road.

###### GENDER
* Many products, from fragrances to footwear, are targeted at either men or women. Differentiating by gender starts at a very early age--even diapers are sold in pink versions for girls and blue for boys. An all-female marketing team at Procter & Gamble, who jokingly call themselves "chicks in charge", introduced Crest Rejuvenating Effects, the first mass-market toothpaste positioned just for woemn. P&G communicates that this product is feminine when the company packages it in teal tube nestled inside a glimmering "pearlescent" box. The toothpaste is sparkly, teal-toned, and tastes like vanilla and cinnamon.

###### FAMILY STRUCTURE AND LIFE STAGE
* A person's family structure and marital status is another important demographic variable, because it has such a big effect on a consumer's spending priority. Young singles and newlyweds are the most likely to exercise, go to bars, concerts, and movies, and consume alcohol. Families with young children are big purchasers of health foods and fruit juices, while single-parent households and those with older children buy more junk food. Home maintenance services are most likely to be used by older couples and dual-career couples.

###### SOCIAL CLASS AND INCOME
* People grouped within the same social class are approximately equal in terms of their incomes and social standing in the community. They work in roughly similar occupations, and they tend to have similar tastes in music, clothing, art, and so on. They also tend to socialize with one another and share many ideas and values regarding the way life should be lived. The distribution of wealth is of great interest to marketers because it determines which groups have the greatest buying power and market potential.

###### ETHNICITY
* Multiculturalism and Canada go hand in hand. This country comprises immigrants from all over the globe. Canada accepts nearly 1 million immigrants and refugees every four years, by far the highest per capita rate of immigration in the world. We are diverse in our languages and in the cultural consumption that stems from our different ethnicities. For example, English is now a minority language in Vancouver. The growth of the Asian market in Canada has led to trilingual labeling of some products. Since Canadians blend together from many different racial and cultural backgrounds, we also blend together in our consumption heritage, as signified by food. As a culture, we are just as likely to enjoy eating sushi as pyrophy (a.k.a perogies) or lasagna.

###### GEOGRAPHY
* The climate changes drastically from region to region in Canada, which makes segmenting some products by region obvious. For example, more snow blowers and fur coats are sold east of the Rocky Mountains, more umbrellas and raincoats to the west. Humidifiers and dehumidifiers are a must in regions around the Great Lakes. On the Prairies, it is not unusual for people to have two or more freezers in their basements; many people who live in farming regions preserve the food they produce for winter and year-round consumption.
* Within regions, there are some different cultural pockets and hence differences in food tastes. New Brunswick has teh highest consumption of sliced white bread, while Alberta leads in bubblegum sales. Most corn flakes are sold on t he Prairies, and linguini has its highest sales in Toronto. Quebecers consume the least amount of frozen french fries, preferring the real thing.

###### LIFESTYLES: BEYOND DEMOGRAPHICS
* Consumers also have very different lifestyles, even if they share other characteristics such as gender or age. The way we feel about ourselves, the things we value, the things we like to do in our spare time--all of these factors help determine which products will push our buttons, or even those that will make us feel better. As one example, the car company VM decided to market to consumers who followed the MTV program Pimp My Ride and enjoyed the activities involved in restoring into trickled-out street machines. To do so, they released a series of online viral ad videos featuring a German engineer and his assistant "unpimping" autos belongs to those that enjoy this specific lifestyle. By poking fun, the VM brand attracted individuals to watch the ad and pass it along to others with similar interests.
