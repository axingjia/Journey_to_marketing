# CHAPTER 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

## INTRODUCTION

### Consumer Behaviour: People in the Marketplace
* This book is about people like you. It concerns the products and services you buy and use and the ways these purchases fit into your lives. This introductory chpater briefly describes some important aspects of the field of consumer behaviour and some of the essential explanations for how people interact with the marketing system.
* For now, though, let's look at one "typical" consumer: you. This brief discussion allows us to highlight some aspects of consumer behaviour that will be covered in the rest of this book.

* As a consumer, you can be described and compared with other individuals in a number of ways. For some purposes, marketers might find it useful to categorize you in terms of your age, sex, income, or occupation. These are some examples of objectively measurable descriptive characteristics of a population, or demographics. In other cases, marketers would rather know something about your interests in clothing or music, or the way you spend your leisure time. This sort of psychological information comes under the category of psychographics, which can include aspects of a person's lifestyle, interests, attitudes, values, and personality. Knowledge of consumer demographics and psychographics plays an extremely important role in many marketing applications, such as defining the market for a product or deciding upon the appropriate techniques to employ when targeting a certain group of consumers.
* Your purchase decisions are heavily influenced by the opinions and behaviours of your friends. A lot of product information, as well as recommendations to use or avoid particular brands, is transmitted by conversation among real people rather than by way of TV commercials, magazines, billboards, or even bizarre websites. The web has created thousands of online consumption communities where members share views and product recommendations about anything from airline loyalty programs to iPhone apps. The bonds among peer groups are cerented by the products they use in common. There is also pressure on each group member to buy things that will meet with the group's approval, and there is often a price to pay in the form of group rejection or embarrassment when one member does not conform to others' conception of what is good or bad, "in" or "out".
* As members of a large society, people share certain cultural values or strongly held beliefs about the way the world should be structured. Other values are shared by members of subcultures, or smaller groups within the culture, such as French Canadians, teens, "prairie people", or even Hell Angels.
* When examining websites, you are exposed to many competing brands. There might be numerous sites that do not capture your attention at all, while there are others that you barely notice or reject because they do not fit the "image" with which you identify or to which you aspire. Using market segmentatino strategies means targeting a brand only to a specific group of consumers rather than to everybody--even if it means that other consumers will not be interested in or may even deliberately avoid that brand.
* Brand often have clearly defined images or "personalities" created by prodcut advertising, packaging, branding, and other marketing strategies that focus on positioning a product a certain way. The choice of a favourite website is very much a lifestyle statement: it says a lot about what a person is interested in as well as sommething about the type of person he or she would like to be. people often choose a product because they like its image or because they feel that its personality somehow corresponds to their own. Moreover, consumers may believe that when they buy and use the product or service its desirable qualities will "rub off" onto them.
* When a product succeeds in satisfying a customer's specific needs or desires, it may be rewarded with many years of brand loyalty, a bond between product and consumer that is very difficult for competitors to break. Often a change in the consumer's life situation or self-concept is required to weaken this bond and thus create opportunities for competitors.
* Consumers' evaluations of products are affected by the products' appearance, taste, texture, or smell. We may be swayed by the shape and colour of a package as well as by more subtle factors such as the symbolism used in a brand name, in an advertisement, or even in the choice of a cover model for a magazine. These judgments are affected by--and often reflect--how a society feels that people should define themselves at that point in time. If asked, you might not even be able to say exactly why you considered some websites and rejected others. many product meanings are hidden below the surface of t he packaging and advertising, and this book will discuss some of the methods used by marketers and social scientists to discover or apply these meanings.
* Our opinions and desires are increasingly shaped by input from around the world, which is becoming a much small place because of rapid advancements in communications technology and transportation systems. In today's global culture, consumers often prize products and services that "transport" them to different places and allow them to experience the diversity of other cultures--even if only to watch others brush their teeth.

### What is Conumser Behaviour
* The field of consumer behaviour covers a lot of ground: **It is the study of the processes involved when individuals or group select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs and desires.** Consumers take many forms, ranging from an eight-year-old child begging her mother for a Monster High doll to an executive at a large corporation choosing a multimillion-dollar computer system. The items that are consumed can include anything from **canned peas to a massage, democracy to hip hop, and even other people (e.g., the images of rock stars)**. Need and desires to be satisfied range from **hunger and thirst to love, status, or even spirtual fulfillment**. And, as we'll see throughout this book, people can get passionate about a broad range of products.

#### Consumer Behaviour is a process
* In its early stages of development, the field of consumer behaivour was often referred to as buyer behaviour, **reflecting an emphasis on the interaction between consumers and producers at the time of purchase. Marketers now recognize that consumer brhaviour is an ongoing process, not merely what happens at the moment a consumer hands over money or a credit card and in turn receives a good or service.**

        Some issues that arise during stages in the consumption process

        | | Consumer Perspective | Marketer's perspective
        |---| ---| ---|
        | Prepurchase issues| How does a consumer decides that he or she needs a product? What are the best sources of information to learn more about alternative choices | How are consumer attitude toward products formed and changed? What cues do consumers use to infer which products are superior to others? |
        | Purchase Issues | Is acquiring a product a stressful or pleasant experience? What does the purchase say about the consumer? | How do situational factors, such as **time pressure or store displays**, affect the consumer's purchase decision?
        | Postpurchase Issues | Does the product provide pleasure or perform its intended function? How is the product eventually disposed of, and what are the environmental consequences of this act? | What determines whether a consumer will be satisfied with a product and whether he or she will buy it again? Does this person tell others about his or her experiences with the product that affects their purchase decisions?

* The exchange, in which two or more organizations or people give and receive something of value, is an integral part of marketing. Although exchange is an important part of consumer behaviour, the expanded view emphasizes the entire consumption process, which includes the issues that influences the consumer before, during, and after a purchase.

## CONSUMERS' IMPACT ON MARKETING STRATEGY
* Why should managers, advertisers, and other marketing professionals bother to learn about consumer behaviour? Very simply, understanding consumer behaivour is good business. A basic marketing concept states that **firms exist to satisfy consumers' needs. These needs can be satisfied only to the extent that marketers understand the people or organizations that will use the products and services they are trying to sell--and do so better than their competitors.**
* **Consumer response is the ultimate test of whether a marketing strategy will succeed.** Thus, **knowledge about consumers is incorporated into virtually every facet of a successful marketing plan**. **Data about consumers help marketers define the market and identify threats to a brand and opportunities for it.** And, **in the world of marketing, nothing is forever.** This knowledge also helps ensure that the product continues to appeal to its core market. The purpose of understanding consumer behaviour is to predict the future. **Anyone can see what is happening at present, but in consumer behaviour we are also focused on tomorrow.** Throughout this book, we will highlight takeaways from consumer behaviour for marketers in boxes entitled "Marketing Insight".

### Segmenting Consumers
* The process of marketing segmentation identifies groups of consumers who are similar to one another in one or more ways and then devises marketing strategies that appeal to one or more groups. As our society evolves from a mass culture in which many consumers share the same preferences to a diverse one in which we have almost an infinite number of choices, it's more important than ever to identify distinct market segments and develop specialized messages and products. It's also important to deliver those specialized messages through diverse channels.
* As we'll see later, building loyalty to a brand is a very smart marketing strategy,so sometimes companies define markets segments by identifying their most faithful customers or heavy users. For example, in the fast-food industry the loyal user accounts for only one of five customers but for about 60 percent of all visits to fast-food restaurants. Aside from frequent use of a product, there are many dimensions that can be used to slice up a larger market.
* As we've already seen, demographics are statistics that measure observable aspects of a population, such as birth rate, age distribution, and income. Statistics Canada is a major source of demographic data on families. This informaiton is available at www.statcan.gc.ca. The changes and trends revealed in demographic studies are of great interest to marketers, because the data can be used to locate and predict the sizes of markets for many products, ranging from home mortgages to brooms and can openers. Imagine trying to sell baby-food to a single male, or an around-the-world vacation to a couple making $15000 a year!
* Table 1-1 below provides a statistical snapshot of the "typical" Canadian consumer, based on data compiled from Statistics Canada. As you go down this list, you will quickly see that many characteristics do not apply directly to you. How different are you from this consumer?

        Table 1-1: A Statistical Picture of the Average or Typical Canadian Consumer
        * The typical Canadian is a woan who is 39.9 years old.
        * The average Canadian worked approximately 36.4 hours per week in 2011
        * The average income of a Canadian was approximately $840 per week in 2011.
        * In 2010, the average Canadian household spent $14,997 on shelter
        * In 2010, the average household spent $894 on personal care
        * The average household spent $3452 on clothing purchases in 2010
        * The average household spent $3539 on recreation in 2010
        * The average Canadian watched 20.06 hours of television per week in 2010.

* In consumers' personalities, attitudes, values, and lifestyles. For now, let's summarize a few of the most important demographic dimensions, each of which will be developed to more detail in later chapters.

###### AGE
* Consumers of different age groups obviously have very different needs and wants. Although people who belongs t o the same age group differ in many other ways, they tend to share a set of values and common cultural experiences that they carry throughout life. **In some cases marketers initially develop a product to attract one age group and then try to broaden its appeal later on.** That's what the energy drink Red Bull has done. Red Bull was originally introduced in bars, nightclubs, and gyms to the product's core audience of young people. Over time, the drink became popular in other contexts, and now the company is sponsoring the PGA European Tour to broaden its reach to older individuals. It's also handing out free cans to commuters, cab drivers, and car-rental agencies to market the drink as a way to stay alert on the road.

###### GENDER
* Many products, from fragrances to footwear, are targeted at either men or women. Differentiating by gender starts at a very early age--even diapers are sold in pink versions for girls and blue for boys. An all-female marketing team at Procter & Gamble, who jokingly call themselves "chicks in charge", introduced Crest Rejuvenating Effects, the first mass-market toothpaste positioned just for woemn. P&G communicates that this product is feminine when the company packages it in teal tube nestled inside a glimmering "pearlescent" box. The toothpaste is sparkly, teal-toned, and tastes like vanilla and cinnamon.

###### FAMILY STRUCTURE AND LIFE STAGE
* A person's family structure and marital status is another important demographic variable, because it has such a big effect on a consumer's spending priority. Young singles and newlyweds are the most likely to exercise, go to bars, concerts, and movies, and consume alcohol. Families with young children are big purchasers of health foods and fruit juices, while single-parent households and those with older children buy more junk food. Home maintenance services are most likely to be used by older couples and dual-career couples.

###### SOCIAL CLASS AND INCOME
* People grouped within the same social class are approximately equal in terms of their incomes and social standing in the community. They work in roughly similar occupations, and they tend to have similar tastes in music, clothing, art, and so on. They also tend to socialize with one another and share many ideas and values regarding the way life should be lived. The distribution of wealth is of great interest to marketers because it determines which groups have the greatest buying power and market potential.

###### ETHNICITY
* Multiculturalism and Canada go hand in hand. This country comprises immigrants from all over the globe. Canada accepts nearly 1 million immigrants and refugees every four years, by far the highest per capita rate of immigration in the world. We are diverse in our languages and in the cultural consumption that stems from our different ethnicities. For example, English is now a minority language in Vancouver. The growth of the Asian market in Canada has led to trilingual labeling of some products. Since Canadians blend together from many different racial and cultural backgrounds, we also blend together in our consumption heritage, as signified by food. As a culture, we are just as likely to enjoy eating sushi as pyrophy (a.k.a perogies) or lasagna.

###### GEOGRAPHY
* The climate changes drastically from region to region in Canada, which makes segmenting some products by region obvious. For example, more snow blowers and fur coats are sold east of the Rocky Mountains, more umbrellas and raincoats to the west. Humidifiers and dehumidifiers are a must in regions around the Great Lakes. On the Prairies, it is not unusual for people to have two or more freezers in their basements; many people who live in farming regions preserve the food they produce for winter and year-round consumption.
* Within regions, there are some different cultural pockets and hence differences in food tastes. New Brunswick has teh highest consumption of sliced white bread, while Alberta leads in bubblegum sales. Most corn flakes are sold on t he Prairies, and linguini has its highest sales in Toronto. Quebecers consume the least amount of frozen french fries, preferring the real thing.

###### LIFESTYLES: BEYOND DEMOGRAPHICS
* Consumers also have very different lifestyles, even if they share other characteristics such as gender or age. The way we feel about ourselves, the things we value, the things we like to do in our spare time--all of these factors help determine which products will push our buttons, or even those that will make us feel better. As one example, the car company VM decided to market to consumers who followed the MTV program Pimp My Ride and enjoyed the activities involved in restoring into trickled-out street machines. To do so, they released a series of online viral ad videos featuring a German engineer and his assistant "unpimping" autos belongs to those that enjoy this specific lifestyle. By poking fun, the VM brand attracted individuals to watch the ad and pass it along to others with similar interests.

### Relationship Marketing: Building Bonds with Consumers
* **Marketers are carefully defining customer segments and listening to people in their markets as never before. Many of them have realized that a key to success is building relationships that will last a lifetime between brands and customers.** Relationship marketing involves making an effort to interact with customers on a regular basis, **giving them reasons to maintain a bond with the company over time.** Tony Roma's, a rib restaurant, practises the notion of relationship marketing in a very simple way--by sending regular customers a coupon for their birthdays that entitles them to free meal at the restaurant.

### MARKETING'S IMPACT ON CONSUMERS
* Does marketing imitate life or vice versa? After the movie The Wedding Crashers becam a big hit, hotels, wedding planners, and newlyweds reported an outbreak of uninvited guests who tried to gain access to parties across the United States. For better or for worse, we all live in a world that the actions of marketers and the media significantly influence. Throughout in this book, we will highlight the ways in which marketers influence consumers in boxes entitled "Consumers in Focus".
* We are surrounded by marketing stimuli in the form of advertisements, stores, and products competing for our attention and our dollars. Marketers filter much of what we learn about the world, whether through the affluence they depict in glamorous magazines or the roles actors play in commercials. Ads show us how we should act with regard to recycling, alcohol consumption, and even the types of houses and cars we wish to own. In many way we are also "at the mercy" of marketers, since we rely on them to sell us products t hat are safe and that perform as promised, to tell us the truth about what they are selling, and to price and distribute these products fairly.

#### Marketing and Culture
* Popular culture, consisting of the music movies, sports, books, celebrities, and other forms of entertainment consumed by the mass market, is both a product and an inspiration for marketers. Our lives are also affected in far-reaching ways, ranging from how we acknowledge cultural events such as marriage, death, or holidays to how we view social issues susch as air pollution, gambling, and addition. The Stanley cup, holiday shopping, federal elections, container recycling, and tweeting are all examples of products and activities that touch many lives.
* This cultural influence is difficult to overlook, althoough many people do not seem to realize how much of their views of the world around them--their movie and musical heroes, the latest fashions, food and decorating choices, and event the physical features they find attractive or ugly in men and women--are affected by marketers. For example, consider the product icons that marketers use to create an identity for their products. Various mythical creatures and personalities--from the Pillbury Doughboy to Sasquatch--have been at one time or another central figures in popular culture. In fact, it is likely that more consumers could recognize such characters than could identify past prime ministers, business leaders, or artists. Although  the characters never really existed, many of use feel as if we "know" them, and they certainly are effect "spokecharacters" for the products they represent.
* Consumer-generated content, in which consumers themselves voice their opinions about products, brands, and companies on blogs, podcasts, and social networking sites such as Facebook, and even film their own commercials that thousands view on sites such as Youtube, is also an important part of marketing's influence on culture. Doritos has utilized consumer-generated ads in their Super Bowl advertising since 2006, and these ads often score top honours as the ad that the most vieweres remember. Videos like the one for Rebecca Black's song "Rriday" have shown that anyone can product content that, even if strongly disliked by the majority of consumers, finds its way into the broader North American culture.

#### The Meaning of Consumption
* One of the fundamentla premises of the modern field of consumer behaviour is **that people often buy products not for what they do but for what they mean.** This principle does not imply that a product's basic function is unimportant, but rather that the roles products play in our lives go well beyond the tasks they perform. And the deeper meanings of a product may help it to stand out from others, similar goods and services. Other things being equal, a person will choose the brand that has an image (or even a personality) consistent with his or her underlying needs.
* For example, although most people probably couldn't run faster or jump higher if they were wearing Nike shoes as opposed to Adidas,  many diehard loyalists swear by their favourite brand. These arch-rivals are largely marketed in terms of their images--meanings carefully crafted with the help of legions of rock stars, athletes, and slickly produced commercials--and many millions of dollars. So when you buy a Nike "swoosh", **you may be doing more than choosing footwear; you may also be making a lifestyle statement about the type of person you are or want to be. For a relatively simple item made of leather and laces, that's quite a feat!**
* Our allegiances to particular sneakers, musicians, or soft drinks help us define our place in modern society, and these choices also help us form bonds with others who share similar preferences. This comment by a participant in a focus group captures the curious bonding that can be caused by consumption choices: " I was at a Stanley Cup party, and I picked up an obscure drink. Somebody else across the room went "Yo!" because he had the same thing. People feel connection when you're drinking the same thing.

#### The Global Consumer
* The majority of people on Earth live in urban centres. In fact, the number of megacities, defined as urban centres of 10 million people or more, is projected to grow to 26 in 2015. Already, China boasts four shopping centres that are larger than the massive West Edmonton Mall, and within five years it will be home to seven of the world's largest malls. One by-product of sophisticated marketing strategies is the movement toward a global consumer culture, in which people around the world are united by their common devotion to brand-name consumer goods, movie stars, and celebrity.
* We owe much of this interconnectedness to developments in technology that allow us to link with companies--and with each other--regardless of our phsyical location. U-commerce is the use of ubiquitous networks, whether in the form of wearable computers or customized advertisements beamed to us on our cell phones ("Hey, you're walking by McDonald's. Come on in for today's burger special".), that enable real-time connecitons in business and consumption behaviour.
* Many products already carry a plastic RFID tag containing a computer chip and a tiny antenna that lets the chip communicate with a network. Grocery items will tell  the store what needs to be restocked and which items and past their expiration dates, and your house will know when you're pulling in the driveway as it turns on the lights and starts your favourite tunes spinning before you walk in the door. Already IBM has introduced "smart" washers and dryers in some college and university dorms that let students keep tabs on their laundry from anywhere they can access the Internet--their dorm rooms, the library, or cell phone. Student can log onto a webpage to see if any machines are free and receive an email or text when their load is finished.
* The rise of globa marketing means that even smaller companies are looking to expand overseas--and this increases the pressure to understand how customers in other countries are the same as or different from the customers in the host country. In the restaurant industry, for example, Shakey's pizza restaurants are mushrooming in the Philipines, and food from the International House of Pancakes is selling like hotcakes in Tokyo. But menu changes are sometimes called for to please local palates: Schlozsky's in Malasia offers Smoky Mountain Chicken Crunch with "half-virgin" chicken, and diners in Bob's Big Boy in Thailand snap up Tropical Shrimp, deep fried with "exotic breading". This book pays special attention to the good and bad aspects of this cultural homogenization.

###### VIRTUAL CONSUMPTION
* Electronic marketing increases convenience by breaking down many of the barriers caused by time and location. You can shop 24 hours a day without leaving home and you can find a product online at an e-tailer in another country and order it for delivery--whether you are at home or somewhere else around the globe.
* And it's not all about business selling to consumers (B2C commerce). In addition, virtual consumption has greatly facilitated consumer-to-consumer activity (C2C commerce). Just as e-consumers are not limited to local retail outlets in their shopping they are not limited to their local communities when looking for friends.
* Picture a small group of local collectors who meet once a month at a local diner to discuss their shared interests over coffee. Now multiply that group by thousands, and include people from all over the world with a shared passion for sports memorabilia, Barbie dolls, Harley-Davidson motorcycles, refrigerator magnets, or massively multiplayer online games such as WOW. These are examples of virtual brand communities.
* The Web also provides an easy way for onsumers around the world to exchange informatio nabout their experiences. Sites like RottenTomatoes.com, retail sites like Amazon.com, and RatemyProfessors.come enable consumers to share their thoughts and feelings on everything from movies, to books, to the professor they had last semester.
* If you're a typical student, you probably can't recall a time when the Internet was just a static, one-way platform that transmitted text and a few sketchy images. The term digital native originated to describe students that have grown up "wired" in a highly networked, always-on world where digital technology had always existed. Today the Internet is the backbone of our society. Widespread access to device like personal computers, digital video and audio recorders, webcams, and smartphones ensures that consumers or practically any age and who live in virtually any part of the world can create and share content. But information doesn't just flow from big companies or governments down to the people, today to the people; today each of us can communicate with huge numbers of people by a click on a keypad, so information flows across people as well.
* That's what we mean by a **horizontal revolution**. This horizontal revolution is characterized in part by the prevalence of social media. Social media are the online means of communication, conveyance, collaboration, and cultivation among interconnected and interdependent networks of people, communities, and organizations enhanced by technological capabilities and mobility.
* Facebook, the largest social media platform, offers synchoronous interactions (ones that occur in real time, as when you text back and forth with a friend) and asynchronous interactions (ones that don't require all participants to respond immediately, as when you text a friend and get an answer the next day), photo sharing, games, applications, groups, e-retailing, and more, and currently has more than 845 million active users. if Facebook were a country, it would be the third-most-populated in the world. And people aren't just joining social communities, they are contributing too! Youtube users upload more than 35 hours of video every minute of every day. That's roughly equivalent to 176,000 full-length movies uploaded weekly. In just 30 days on Youtube, more video is broadcast than in the past 60 years on CBS, NBC, and ABC broadcasting networks combined. Consider these mind-boggling social media stats:

                * If you were paid $1 for every time an article was posted on Wikipedia, you would earn $156.23 per hour
                * It took radio 38 years to reach 50 million listeners. TV took 13 years to reach 50 million users. The Internet took four years to reach 50 million people. In under nine months, Facebook added 100 million users.
                * About 70 percents of Facebook users are outside the United States
                * Social media activity has overtaken porn as  the number one online activity.
                * One out of eight couples married last year met using a social media site
                * Eight percent of companies use Linkedin as their primary recruiting tool
                * Twenty-fve percent of search results for the world's top ten brands are to user-generated content.
                * More than 1.5 million pieces of content are shared on Facebook daily.
                * Eight percent of Twitter usage is from mobile devices, and 17 percent have tweeted while on the toilet.

* This is all exciting stuff, especially because social media platforms enable a culture of participation--a belief in democracy; the ability to freely interact with other people, companies, and organizations; open access to ventures  that allows users to share content from simple comments to reviews, ratings, photos, stories, and more; and the power to build on the content of others from one's own unique point of view. Of course, jsut as with democracy in the real world, we have to take the bitter with the sweet. There are plenty of unsavoury things going on in cyberspace, and the hours people spend on Facebook, on online gambling sites, or in virtual worlds such as Second Life, have led divorce, bankruptcy, or jail in the real world.

### Markting Ethics and Public Policy
* In business, conflicts often arise between the goal of succeeding in the marketplace and the desire to conduct business honestly and to maximize the well-being of consuemrs by providing them with safe and effective products and services. Accordingly, many universities and corporations are now focusing very intently on teaching and reinforcing ethical behaviour.

###### BUSINESS ETHICS
* Business ethics are essentially rules of conduct that guide actions in the marketplace--the standards against which most people in a marketplace judge what is right, wrong, good, or bad. These universal values include honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, respect, justice, integrity, concern for others, accountability, and loyalty.
* Ethical business is good business. Consumers think better of products made by firms they feel are behaving ethically. But jsut what is ethical behaviour? Sometimes it's not so easy to tell. For example, when you download songs from Kazaa or other filesharing programs, are you stealing? The film and recording industries think you are!
* Notions of right and wrongs do differ across people, organizations, and cultures. Some businesses, for example, believe it is all right for salespeople to persuade customers to buy even if it means giving them false information, while other firms feel that anything less than total honesty with customers is terribly wrong. Because every culture has its own set of values, beliefs, and customs, ethical business behaviours are defined quite differently around the world. For example, one recent study found that because of differences in values (more on this in Chapter 6). Mexican firms are less likely to have formal codes of ethics and more likely to bribe public officials than are Amercian or Canadian commpanies. On the other hand, different attitudes about work and interpersonal relationship mean that Mexican companies are also more likely to treat lower-level employees better than do their NAFTA partners to the north.

###### PRESCRIBING ETHICAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
SKIM

### NEEDS AND WANTS: DO MARKETERS MANIPULATE CONSUMERS
* One of the most common and stinging cricisms of marketing is that marketing techniques (especially advertising) are responsible for convincing consumers that they "need" many material things and that they will be unhappy and somehow inferior people if they do not have these "necessities". The issue is a commplex one and is certainly worth considering: Do marketers give people what they want, or they tell people what they should want?

##### Subheader: Do Marketers Create Artificial Needs?
* The marketing system has come under fire from both ends of teh political spectrum. On the one hand, some believe that advertising contributes to the moral breakdown of society by presenting images of hedonistic pleasure, thus encouraging the pursuit of secular humanism. On the other hand, some argue  that the same deceitful promises of material pleasure function to buy off people who would  otherwise be revolutionaries working to chnage the system. Through advertising, the system creates demand that only its products can satisfy.
* One such response to this argument is that **a need is a basic biological motive, while a want represents one way society has taught us to satisfy that need**. For example, while thirst is biologically based, we are taught to want Coca-Cola to satisfy that thirst rather than, say, goat's milk. **Thus, the need is already there; marketers simply recommend ways to satisfy it. A basic objective of advertising is to create awareness that these needs exist, rather  than to create the needs.**

#### Subheader: Are Advertising and Marketing Neccessary?
* As social critic Vance Packard wrote: "large-scale efforts are being made, often with impressive success, to channel our unthinking habits, our purchasing decisions, and our thought processes by the use of insights gleaned from psychiatry and the social sciences". The economist John Kenneth Galbraith felt that radio and TV are important tools to accomplish this manipulation of the masses. Since virtually no literacy is required to use these media, they allow repetitive and compelling communications to reach almost everyone. This criticism may be even more relevant to online communications, where a simple click delivers a world of information us.
* **Goods are arbitrarily linked t o desirable social attributes. One influential critic even argued that the problem is that we are not materialistic enough; that is, we do not sufficiently value goods for the utilitarian functions they deliver but instead focus on the irrational value of goods for what they symbolize.** According to this view, for eample, "beer would be enough for us, without the additional promise that in drinking it we show ourselves to be manly, young at heart, or neighbourly."
* One response to this particular argument is that products are designed to meet existing needs, and **advertising merely helps to communicate the products' availability**. According to the economics-of-information perspective, advertising is an important source of consumer information. This view emphasizes t he economic cost of the time spent searching for products, arguing that consuemrs are willing to pay for advertising because the information it provides reduces search time.

##### Subheader: Welcom to Consuemr Space
* Who controls the market--companies or consumers? This question is becoming even more complictated as new ways of buying, having, and being are invented every day. it seems that the "good old days" of marketer space, in which companies called the shots and decided what they wanted their customers to know and do, are dead and gone. Many people now feel empowered to choose how, when, or if they will interact with corporations as they construct their own consuemr space. **In turn companies need to develop and leverage brand equity in bold new ways to attract the loyalty of these consumer "nomads". People still "need" companies--but in new ways and on their own terms.** As we'll see throughout this book, profound changes in consumer behaviour are influencing how people search for product information and evaluate alternative brands. In today's consumer space, we have the potential to shape our own marketing destinies.

##### Subheader: Public Policy and Consumerism
* The welfare of the consumer is protected by many laws at the deferal, provincial, and mulicipal levels. Regulations put forth by these governmental agencies sometimes overlap and are constantly changing. The main thrust of regulation is to protect the consumer from unfair business practices and to protect the broad interests of society. Laws that involve "cooling-off" periods for signing the purchase agreements try to protect average consumers from getting into things they later regre. Other laws, such as labelling of harmful products (e.g., cigarettes) and the prohibition of sales of certain substances (e.g., melatonin), are meant to protect the health of Canadians. Some of the various laws are outlined in Table 1-2

* the field of consumer behaviour can play an important role in improving our lives as consumers. Many researchers assist in formulating or evaluating public policies such as those that ensure that products are labelled accurately, that people can understand important information presented in advertising, or that children are not exploited by program length toy commercials  misquerading as TV shows.
* Of course, to a large degree consumers depend on their governments to regulate and police safety and environmental standards. Protecting consumers is more problematic this centry as the majority of manufacturing has moved offshore. Millions of Chinese-made toys are regularly pulled off shelves because of lead paint or basic design flaws. MEGA Brands used to be a darling of the Canadian stock exchange, but finanical losses from product recalls of poorly manufactured and designed toys have left the company hurting. These problems are not limited to hard goods. A major Chinese supermarket chain in Canada had to pull a possibly tained baby milk formula after 6000 babies were sickened in China. The Chinese-made brands were suspected of containing melamine, a chemical that makes the product appear to have higher protein levels than it actually does.

#### Subheader: Consumer Activism and its Impact on Marketing
* Adbusters is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for "the new social activist movement of the information age." Adbusters sponsors numerous initiatives, including Buy Nothing Day and TV Turnoff week, intended to discourage rampand commercialism. These efforts, along with biting ads and commercials that lampoon advertising messages, are part and parcel of a strategy called **culture jamming** that aims to disrupt efforts by the corporate world to dominate our cultural landscape. The Cultural jammers Manifesto proclaims opposition to the so-called mind-poluuters: "On the rubble of the old culture, we will build a new one with a non-commercial heart and soul." Indeed, Adbusters was at the forefront in starting the Occupy movement seen in 2011 in a number of North Amercian cities.
* Firms themselves are becoming increasingly interested in Corporate Social Responsibility, by which they voluntarily choose to protect or enhance their positive social and environmental impacts as they go about their business activities. This is often driven by consumer demand, as companies attempt to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. Companies such as the Lush, the Body Shop, and American Apparel have successfully differentiated themselves on ethical attributes. While some marketers donate their own money to good cause (corporate giving), others promise donations to charity as purchase incentives (a form of cause-related marketing). Other firms have taken a green marketing approach in which they offer products in ways that are less harmful to the environment. Some firms have focused their efforts on reducing wasteful packaging, as when P&G introduce refillable containers for Downy fabric softener.
* **Social marketing** refers to using marketing techniques normally employed to sell beer or detergent to encourage positive behaviour such as increased literacy or to discourage negative activities such as drunk driving.

### Header: HOW DO WE FIND OUT ABOUT CONSUMERS? THE ROLE OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
* As noted above, marketers often wish to find out about consumers' attitudes, opinions, behaviours, and preferences because by understanding the consumer, the marketer is best able to appeal to relevant needs. To this end, marketers often engage in various forms of consumer (marketing) research. Two ways this can be done are by the researcher specifically for the research question at hand, this is called **primary research**. However, sometimes the marketer can find the information needed by going to a pre-existing source of information collected for another purpose. When the researcher uses data collected by another entity to answer a new research question, this is called **secondary research**. For example, as noted above, when the Government of Canada collects statistical information regarding its citizens marketers may use this information to provide insights about the consumer in ways that inform marketing strategy (www.statcan.gc.ca)

### Bigheader: Primary Research
* A number of options are available to marketers and consuemr researchers who want to collect primary data regarding consumers. As we will see, common techniques include surveys, focus groups, interviews, observational research, qualitative methods, and experiments.

###### Subheader: SURVEY RESEARCH
* one common method of data collection is using surveys. A survey is a method of data collection in which the respondents self-report answers to a set of questions posed by the researcher. The most common forms of surveys include  written surveys, online surveys, and phone surveys. Surveys can include a variety of types of questions including those calling for open-ended responses, those requiring fill-in-the-blanks, and those using rating scales. As with any data collection technique, surveys have pros and cons. This research method using allows researchers to collect data from a lot of people within a relative short period of time, but may not allow consumers to provide as rich as detailed responses as other research methods.

###### Subheader: FOCUS GROUP
* Because of some of the limitations of the survey method, researchers sometimes turn to focus group research. Focus groups usually involve small group sessions with appropriate **six to twelve consumer participants**. The session is guided by a moderator who leads a group discussion involving a product, concept, or marketing message. Focus groups are often used when a new idea or product is being tested, or the researchers group are often used when a new idea or product is being tested, or the researchers want to generate new ideas for what strategic direction to take next. As you might guess, one benefit of focus group is that they tend to **elicit more rich, detailed, and narrative feedback from consumers.** One drawback, however, is that social influence can play a role, dampening the expression of consumers' true individual attitudes (see chapter 11) for a discussion of some of these effects.

###### Subheader: INTERVIEW
* One other research technique is to utilize in-depth interviews. Like focus group, interviews involve direct contact with the consumer. In contrast to focus group, this approach involves a one-on-one interaction with an interviewer and respondent. Interviews allow the researcher to collect rich, in-depth data, but minimize any impacts of group factors influencing consumer responding. Interviews can be particularly useful if the topic is sensitive, embarrassing, or polarizing in some way. The downside of interviews is that the research process can take much longer and is much more expensive if each consumer is being asked questions one at a time.

###### Subheader: OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH
* Another technique commonly employed by marketers is **observational research**. In this type of research consumer behaviours are directly observed, in either a natural context (e.g., at the mall) or a controlled setting (e.g., a lab that observes how children play with new toy products). One drawback of surveys, focus groups, and interviews is that they all involve the consumers themselves reporting on their attitudes, behaviours, or experiences. **One issue with this is that consumers may not always express the truth**; perhaps because they wish to present themselves positively to the researcher, because they don't recall everything accurately, or because they are not consciously aware of all the factors influencing their behaviours. Observation has the benefit of directly tracking and messuring real behaviour.
* One specific type of observation involves **ethnographic research**, in which researchers observe and record how consumers behaviour to real-world contexts, often to understand the meaning consumers subscribe to different consumption experiences. Sometimes the researcher goes as far as to immerse him or herself in the consumption setting, observing people in context over long periods. A famous example of this approach is Intuit's "follow me home" program, in which the researchers asked purchasers of Intuit's software products if they could follow them home to observe how they interacted with and use the software.
* A final type of observational research is centred in technological forms of behavioural observation. Scanner technology and clickstream data gathering are two examples of this type of observation method. Grocery stores such as Safeway and Safe-On-Foods utilize membership cards to observe consumer purchases in an effort to build large databases that inform them on everything from stocking to promotional to pricing decisions. Google analytics is an example of an observation research system that tracks consumer behaviour on websites and provides the using organization with information on clickthrough behaviour and length of time spent on specific webpages.

###### Subheader: QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
* Researchers also can use other measures to get at **more subjective aspects of consumer behaviour and experiences. One such techniques is storytelling, in which consuemrs are asked to tell researchers about their experience with the product. Another technique is role-playing, in which consumers are asked to put themselves in a particular role** (e.g., "Imagine you are a mother of an active family") and act out how they would respond to a particular marketing stimulus (e.g., a mechanized vaccum that does the cleaning for you) **MY this is useful** Other avenues for gathering information include asking consumer to provide photos or pictures in ways that represent their consumption experiences or to keep a diary that tracks responses and behaviours over a period of time. Believe it or not, when seeking ideas for a new line of deodorant, Unilever asked female consumers to keep an "armpit diary", tracking their shaving havits and deodorant usage over time. It turned out the women reported concerns with the condition of their underarm skin, and a new moisturizing line of deodorant was born. All of these are eaxamples of what is called qualitative research, because they tend to tap into the more subjective, experimental, and narrative aspects of the consumption experience.
* When marketers want to collect qualitative data regarding consumers' responses to marketing stimuli that they believe consuemrs will have trouble in providing accurate, unbiased responses they use **projective techniques**. These involves the presentation of an ambiguous, unstructured object, activity, or person that a respondent is asked to interpret or explain. For example, **if the marketer wanted to test potential brand names, they might ask consumers to report, as quickly as possible what words come to mind when they see a particular target word.** The goal here is to choose words congruent with brand image and to not trigger negative consumer reactions. Other projective techniques can involve picture interpretation **(i.e., the consumer is asked to describe what they see in a visual image) and sentence completion tasks (e.g., "all golfers are ____" )** Such techniques are used when the marketer wants consumers' subjective reactions to things like brand names, colours, and advertising images.

###### Subheader: EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
* A final research technique involves conducting experiment, which are **used when the research wants to make cause-and-effect claims**. For example, if teh marketer has a hunch that positive consumer responses to a brand of beer are due to the newly designed label and not other factors such as the taste, brand name, or consumers' moods, an experiment might be an effective strategy to determine if this is the case. In an experiment, the researcher uses random assignment to put participants into groups or experimental conditions. This means each person has an equal chance of ending up in any of the experimental conditions. And, if random assignment to conditions (i.e., a "no label" condition, an "old label" condition, and a "new label" condition) is done properly, each group should not differ on important factors (e.g., the average age, gender breakdown, self-esteem levels, beer-drinking habits, etc. Should be similar in all three groups) before the exerpiement "treatment" is given.
* The researcher then holds everything constant across the different experimental conditions--they are all treated the same by the experimenter, they view the beer product in the same shaped bottle, they all sample one ounce of the product served at the same temperature, etc. The only difference is the key manipulation of the causal factor the researcher wants to examine. In our example, one group might view a beer bottle with no label, one groukp would view the bottle with the old label, and one group would view the bottle with the new label. If the experimenter ensures that the different experimental conditions start out being similar in nature (via random assignment) and keeps everything constant across the groups, except for the administered experimental manipulation (i.e., no label, old label, new label), then any differences across the groups can attributed to the manipulation. In an experiement, the variable that the researcher manipulates (label type) is called the independent variable. The variable that the researcher measures (in this case, taste evaluations) is called the dependent variable.

### BigHeader: TAKING IT FROM HERE: THE PLAN OF THE BOOK
* This book cover many facets of consumer behaviour, and many of the research perspectives briefly described in this chapter will be highlighted in later chapters. The plan of the book is simple: it goes from micro to macro. Think of the book as a sort of photograph album of consumer behaviour. Each chapter provides a "snapshot" of consumers, but the lens used to take each picture get picture gets successively wider.
* The book begins with issues related to the individual consumer and expands its focus until it eventaully considers the behaviours of large groups of people in their social settings. The topics to be covered correspond to the wheel of consuemr behaviour presented in Figure 1-2.
* Section 1, "Consumer in the Marketplace", provides an overview of how consumers influence marketing, and how marketers influence consuemrs in teh marketplace.
* Section 2, "Consumers as Individuals" considers the consumers at his or her most micro level. It examines how the individual receives information from his or her immediate environment and how this material is learned, stored in memory, and used to form and modify individual attitudes--both about products and about the individual.
* Section 3, "Consumers as Decision Makers", explores the ways in which consuemrs use the information they have acquired to make decisions about consumption activities.
* Section 4, "Consumers in Their Social and Cultural Settings", further expands the focus by considering how the consumer functions as a part of a larger social structure. This structure includes the influence of different social groups to which the consumer belongs and with which he or she identifies, including social class, ethnic groups, and age groups. In addition, this section will look at consumers in their broader cultural contexts.

## Consumer Behaviour Challenge

### Discuss
1. This chapter states that people play different roles and that their consumption behaviours may differ, depending on the particular role they are playing. State whether you agree or disagree with this perspective, giving examples from our personal life. Try to construct a "stage set" for a role you play--specify the props, costumes, and script that you use to play a role (e.g., job interviewee, conscientious student, party animal)
2. A company introduced a teddy bear for Valentine's Day called "Crazy for you." This toy aroused the ire of mental health advocates because a straitjacket restrains the cuddly bear's paws and the stuffed animal comes with institutional commitment papers. Supporters of the company's decision to keep selling the bear say opponents are too "politially correct". What do you think
3. Not-for-profit organizations routinely rely on generous corporate donations, and it's common to name facilities after benefactors. The Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio is no exception; its name recognizes the Nationwide insurance ompany's $50 million donation. Now the hospital is adding the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center, and there is also the Limited Too & Justice Main Lobby. Abercrombie & Fitch is notorious for alluring young people with its provocative advertising. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood opposes this partnership. The group's director commented that "Abercrombie & Fitch is among the worst of corporate predators. A company with such cynical disregard for children's well-being shouldn't be able to claim the mantle of healing...And personally, I find it very concerning that they named their hospital after an insurance company." What do you think? Does this cross an ethical line, or does it matter where the money comes from so long as the end result is beneficial?
4. Name some products or services that are widely used by your social group. State whether you agree or disagree with the notion that these products help to form group bonds, supporting your argument with examples from your list of products used by the group.
5. Although demographic information on large numbers of consumers is used in many marketing contexts. Some people believe that the sale of data on customers' incomes, buying habits, and so on consittues an invasion of privacy and should be stopped. Comment on this issue from both a consumer's and a marketer's point of view.
6. List the three stages in the consumption process. Describe the issues that you considered in each of these stage when you made a recent important purchase.
7. What aspects of consumer behaviour are likely to be of interest to a financial planner? To a university administrator? To a graphic arts designer? To a social worker in a government agency? To a nursing instructor?
8. Do marketers have the ability to control our desires or the power to create needs? Is this situation changing as the Internet creates new ways to interact with companies? If so, how?
9. An entrepreneur made interantional news when he set up a website to auction off the egg cells of fahsion models to the highest bidder (minimum bid: $15000). The site was targeted to people who wanted to have very attractive babies because they believe this would maximize their children's chances of succeeding in our society. Is the buying and selling of humans just another example of consumer behaviour at work? Do you agree that this service is simply a more efficient way to maximize the chance of having happy, successful children? Should this kind of marketing activity be allowed? Would you sell your eggs or sperm on a website?

## Experiential Exercises
10. To what degree will consumers trade lower prices for less privacy? Car owners can now let insurance companies monitor their driving using a new technology in exchange for lower rates. Customers who sign up for Progressive's TripSense program get a device the size of a Tic Tac box to plug into their cars. The device will track speed and how many kilometres are driven at what times of day. Every few months, customers unplug the device from the car, plug it into a computer, download the data, and send it to the company. Depending on results, discounts will range from 5 to 25 percent. In great britain, a major insurer is testing a program called Pay as You Drive. Volunteers will get a device the size of a Palm computer installed in their cars. The gadget will use global positioning satellite technology to track where the car goes, constantly sending information back to the insurance company. Cars that spend more time in safer areas will qualify for bigger discounts. Of course, the downside to these efforts is that the insurance companies may be able to collect data on where you have driven, how long you stayed in one location, and so on. Conduct a poll of ten drivers of various ages where you describe these programs and ask respondents if they would participate to receive a discount on their insurance premiums. What reasons do they give for and against the idea? Do you find any differences in attitudes based on demographic characteristics such as age or gender?
11. While you're talking to car owners, probe to see what relationship they have with their vehicles. Do these feelings correspond to the types of consumer/product attachments we discussed in this chapter? How are these relationship manifested. (Hint: see if any of  the respondents have nicknames for their cars, or if they "decorate: them with personal items)

# Chapter 2: Perception

INTRODUCTION

* Whether it's the taste of President's Choice Decadent Chocolate Chunk Cookies, the sight of a Tom Ford perfume ad, or the sound of the music group Coldplay, we live in a world overflowing with sensations. Wherever we turn, we are bombarded by a symphony of colours, sounds, and odours, Some of the "notes" in t his symphony, suchas the loud barking of a dog, the shades of the evening sky, or the heady smell of a rose bush, occur naturally. Others come from people: The people sitting next to you in class might sport tinted blond hair, bright, pink pants, and a vanilla-chocolate scent.
* Marketers certainly contribute to this commotion. Consumers are never far from advertisements, product packages, radio and TV commercials, or billboards that clamour for their attention. Each of us copes with this bombardment by paying attention to some stimuli and tuning out others. And the messages to which we do choose to pay attention often wind up differing from what the sponsors intended, as we each put our "spin" on things by taking away meaning consistent with our own unique experiences, and desires. This chapter focuses on the process of perception, in which sensations are absorbed by the consumer and used to interpret the surrounding world.
* Sensation is the immediate response of our sensory recepters (those in our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin) to such basic stimuli as light, colour, and sound. Perception is the process by which these sensations are selected, organized, and interpreted. The study of perception focuses on what we add to or take away from these raw sensations as we choose which to notice and then go about assigning meaning to them.
* Most marketers would agree that, oftentimes, perception can be more influential than sensation in determining consumer preferences. Coke and Pepsi, for example, are almost identical in chemical composition and blind taste tests consistently show that most consumer don't have the sensory ability to tell the difference between a cold glass of Coke and a cold glass of Pepsi. Below a certain temperature, all we can detect is the cold, the sugar, and the sensation of the bubbles on our tongues. Thus, based on sensation alone, it is difficult to distinguish the two brands of cola. **Anecdotally, however, most of us have a very strong preference for one brand of cola over the other. This is where perception comes into play**.
* One "neuromarketing" study, using brain-scanning (fMRI) technology, found that when no brand name was presented prior to tasting cola beverage (i.e., consumers relied only on sensation), the reward centres of the brain lit up and Coke and Pepsi were equally preferred. But, when explicitly told the brand name before drinking, more consumers preferred Cola, and an entirely different part of the brain lit up--the medial prefrontal corter. This is the area of the brain responsible for thinking and judging. Culturally learned meanings about the brand influenced consumers' ultimate perceptions of Coca-Cola.
* Thus, based on sensation alone, consumers might equally prefer Pepsi and Coke. However, our ultimate preferences are also shaped by our perceptions--how we organize, interpret, and form associations about the brand.

### Bigheader: SENSORY SYSTEMS
* Like computers, people undergo stages of information processing in which stimuli are input and stored. Unlike computers, however, **consumers do not passively process whatever information happens to be present. Only a very small number of the stimuli in our environment are ever noticed. Of these, an even smaller number are attended to, and even these might not be processed objectively. The meaning of the stimulus is interpreted by the individual, who is influenced by his or her unique biases, needs and experiences.** As shown in Figure 2-1, three stages--exposure, attention, and interpretation--make up the process of perception. Before considering each of these stages, let's step back and consider the sensory systems that provide sensations to us in the first place.
* External stimuli, or sensory inputs, can be received on a number of channels. We may see a billboard, hear a jingle, feel the softness of a cashmere sweater, taste a new flavour of ice cream, or smell a leather jacket. The inputs picked up by our five senses consitute the raw data that generate many types of responses. For example, sensory data emanating from the external environment (hearing a song on the radio) can generate internal sensory experiences when the song on the radio triggers a young man's memory of his first dance and brings to mind the smell of his date's perfume or the fell of her hair on his cheek.

### Bigheader: SENSORY MARKETING: HARNESSING PERCEPTION FOR A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
* Guests at Omni Hotels are in for a host of new, luxurious experiences. When they visit the hotel chain's website to reserve a room, they will hear the sound of soft chimes playing. On entering the lobby they'll be hit with the scent of lemongrass and green tea and iew elaborate floral displays. In their rooms they will find eucalyptus bath salts and Sensation Bars--mini bars stocked with items such as mojito-flavoured jelly beans and miniature Zen gardens. In a joint promotion with Starbucks, guests find small, scented stickers on the front pages of their free copies of USA Today--a black berry aroma suggests they start their day at the hotel with a cup of Starbucks coffee "paired with a fresh muffin."
* Welcome to the new era of **sensory marketing**, in which companies pay extra attention to the impact of sensation on our product experiences. From hotels to carmakers to brewers, companies recognize that our senses help us decide which products appeal to us--and which ones stand out from a host of similar offerings in the marketplace. In this section we'll take a closer look at how some smart marketers use our sensory systems to create a competitive advantage.

#### Header: Sight
* Marketers reply heavily on **visual elements in advertising, store design, and packaging.** Meanings are communicated on the visual channel through a product's **colouring, size, styling, brightness, and distinctiveness from competitor's products.**

###### Subheader: HOW EPRCEPTION CAN BE "COLOURED"
* Colour influence our emotions directly. Evidence suggests that some colour (particularly red) create feelings of arousal and stimulate appetite, and others (such as blue) are more relaxing. Products presented against a backdrop of blue in advertisements are better liked than those shown with a red background, and cross-cultural research indicates a consistent prefernce for blue as consumers' favourite colour when they live in Canada or Hong Kong. **People who complete tasks when the words or images are displayed on red backgrounds perform better when they have to remember details, but when blue backgrounds are used they excel at tasks that require an imaginative response.** Olympic athletes who wear red uniforms are more likely to defeat competitors in blue uniforms, and men rate women who wear red as more attractive than those who wear blue. In one study, interior designers created bars decorated primarily in red, yellow, or bluje and invited peopel to choose one  to hang out in. More people chose the yellow and red room, and these guests were more social and active--and ate more. But partygoers in the blue room stayed longer.
* Colours are rich in symbolic value and cultural meanings. For example, red represents good luck to the Chinese and is ofte nthe main color in their celebrations. Such powerful cultural meanings make colour a central aspect of many marketing strategies. Some reactions to colour come from learned associations--in Western countries black is the colour of mourning, while in some Eastern countries, notably Japan, white plays this role. In addition, the colour black is associated with power and may even have an impact on people who wear it. Teams in the National Hockey League who wear black uniforms are among the most aggressive; they consistently rank near the top of the league in penalities during the season.
* We know that perceptions of a colour depend on both its physical wavelength and how the mind responds to that stimulus. Yellow, which is in the middle of wavelengths, detectable by the human eye, is the brightest color and attracts attention. The Yellow Pages were made yellow to heighten the attention level of bored telephone operators. Further, some reactions to color are due to biological differences. Women tend to be drawn to brighter tones and are more sensitve to subtle shadings and patterns, because they see colour better than men do; men are 16 times more likely to be colour blind than women. Age also influences our response to colour. As we get older our eyes mature and our vision takes on a yello cast. Colours look duller to older people, so they prefer white and other bright tones. This helps to explain why mature consumers are much more likely to choose a white car; Lexus, which sells heavily in this market, makes 60 percent of its vehicles in white.
* The choice of colour is frequently a key issue in package design. These choices sued to be made casuaally. Today, however, colour is a serious business, and many companies realize that their colour choices can exert a big influence on consumers' assumptions about what is inside the package. When introducing a white cheese as a "sister product" to an existing blue Castello cheese, a Danish company launched it in a red package under the name of Castello Bianco. The red package was chosen to provide maximum visibility on store shelves. Ahthough taste tests were very positive, sales were disappointing. A subsequent analysis of consumer interpretations showed that the red packaging and the name gave consumers the wrong impression about the product type and its degree of sweetness. Danish consumers had trouble associating the colour red with white cheese. Also, the name Bianco connoted a sweetness that was incompatible with the actual taste of the product. It was relaunched in a white packaging and given the name White Castello. Almost immediately asles more than doubled.
* Some colour combinatinos come to te associated so strongly with a corporation that they become known as the company's trade dress, and the compnay may even be granted exclusive use of these colours. Think of Tiffany and Co. and a distinct shade of blue comes to mind, one which is trademarked by the company. As a rule, however, trade-dress protection is granted only when consumers might be confused about what they are buying because of similar coloration of a competitor's packages. Cadbury Canada recently overhauled its packaging, adding its signature purple colour and logo to all its brands. Survey results showed that while consumers know Creme Eggs and Caramilk bars as Cadbury brands, people did not associate Crispy Crunch, Crunchies, and Mr Big with Cadbury. Therefore, rebranding was necessary to associate all brands through the signature purple colour.

##### Subheader: HOW YOUR EYES MAKE YOU EAT MORE
* Our eyes play tricks on us, and these perceptions can have caloric consequences. When pouring or eating foods from larger boxes, the size of the box implicitly suggests that it's appropriate or "acceptable" to eat more--and we do! One study gave a number of moviegoers free medium-size and large-size popcorn buckets and revealed that those eating out of the large-size buckets ate 45 percent more popcorn. Even when 14-day old popcorn was used, people still ate 32 percent more from the large-size buckets even though they said they hate the popcorn. The same thing happens at parties. MBA students at a Super Bowl party were offered Chex Mix either from huge gallon-size bowls or from twice as many half-gallon bowls. Those dishing from the gallon-bowls ate 53 percent more.
* These visual illusions also influence how much we pour and drink. Take drinking glasses, for example, when we pour into a glass, we tend to focus on the height of the liquid we are pouring and not the width. if we are given two glasses that both hold 24 ounces, for example, we will tend to pour over 30 percent more into the shorter, wider glass than the taller glass, because we focus on the height and don't account for the width. Even the pros get tricked by this illusion. When 48 bartenders were asked to pour a "shot" of alcohol into either a wide tumbler or a tall highball glass, they poured 27 percent more gin, whisky, and vodka in the wide glasses than in the tall ones.
* Visual cues in packaging can also impact consumption in other ways. Take the recent trend of using smaller snack packs and 100-calorie serving sizes in teh marketplace. Although intuition tells consumers that smaller packages should help them to eat less, when multiple small packages are available consumers often eat much more of the product. In fact, it is those consumers who are most concerned with dieting and their appearance who eat the most snack foods when they are presented in small packages. Researchers find that this is becasue these consumers assume the small packages will do the job of controlling their food intake for them, so they give up their own control of watching what they eat and  they often end up eating more than one package.
* Our eyes continue to trick us even when it comes to variety. When we see an assortment of foods, like at Thanksgiving dinner or an all-you-can-eat buffet, this abundance suggests it's appropriate to eat more. College students who are given bowls of M&Ms that have ten colours of M&Ms will eat 26 percent more than those given the same-size bowls with seven colours--even though all M&Ms taste the same. Also, students given six different flavours of jellybeans took and ate 85 percent more when they were mixed up than when they were neatly organized y flavour. 
* The bottom line: When it comes to how much we eat and drink, our eyes often have more to say than our stomachs.

### Header: Smell
* We've all heard of the "Axe Effect", since we've been bombarded with commercials showing women chasing men who use Unilever's personal-care brand. Can it possibly be for real? A British researcher reported that women rated men who used Lynx deodorant (Axe's British counterpart) as more attractive than men who used a "placebo" deodorant with no fragrance. Before you run out to the store, guys, keep in mind that the women didn't actually meet the men face to face; they watched 15-second videos of the men describing themselves. The men in the video were instructed not to bath for 48 hours, and those who used the unfragranced deodorant to hide their "scent" rated themselves lower in self-confidence than di the Lynx users. A unilever consumer scientist explains, "Deodorant is supposed to make you feel good about yourself and give you confidence in the mating game, which is what Axe says."
* Important note: The Axe effect worked only for women who watched the video with no sound--those who actually heared t he men talk didn't show a preference, which supports the diea that self-confidence is translated into body language, which in turn is translated into attractiveness. As one of the researcher joked, "One way you could look at it is that the Axe Effect works as long as you're very quiet."
* Odours can stir emotions or create acalming feeling. They can evoke memories or relieve stress. Some of our responses to scents result from early associations that call up good or bad feelings, which explains why business are exploring connections between smell, memory, and mood. it has been suggested that ambient scent can influence not only moods, but consumer cognitions as well. Researchers have found pleasant scents can increase recall of brand names, particularly when the scent is combined with a visual image.
* At least to some extent, consumers' reactions to odours depend on their cultural background. There is a vast difference, from culture to culture, in how people want to smell. The Germans like to layer it on, while American men don't like to smell "sissy", despite spending more time grooming than the French or Italians. Many multinational companies adjust the scents of their products from country t o country. Even Palmolive dish detergent has a different scent in Europe than in Canada. Vidal Sassoon products sold in Asia include a pine aroma that smells like floor cleaner to Americans. 
* We process fragrance cues in the limbic system, the most primitive part of the brain and the place where we experience immediate emotions. One study even found that the scent of fresh cinnamon buns induced sexual arousal in a sample of male students! In another study, women sniffed T-shirts that men had worn for two days and reported which ones they preferred. The women were most attracted to the odour of men who are genetically similar to themselves, though not too similar. The researchers claimed the findings were evidence that we are "wired" to select compatible mates, but not those so similar as to cause inbreeding problems.
* Researchers have found that the sense of smell can also lead to different behavioural reaction to stimuli. One study found that consumers who viewed ads for either **flowers or chocolate** and who also were exposed to congruent (i.e, flowery or chocolatey, respective) odours spent more time processing the product information and were more likely to try different alternatives within the relevant product category. Other researchers have discovered that "clean" scents such as citrus-scent Windex can lead people to engage in morally "virtuous" acts such as reciprocating a favour or being willing to volunteer for a worthy cause.
* As scientists continue to discover the powerful effects of smell on behaviour, marketers are coming up with ingenious ways to exploit these connections. Ad companies spend about $80 million per year on scent marketing: **the Scent Marketing Institute** estimates that number will reach more than $500 million by 2016. Recently, marketers have leveraged the potential power of smell by using such strategies as **microcapsulating scents in direct mail communication and introducing scratch-and-sniff advertisement in newspapers.** Playing with scents can be a tricky business, however. For example, the "Got Milk" campaign got creative by releasing the scent of chocolate chip cookies in tandem with their ads on bus shelters. However, the marketers were forced to pull the scents in response to complaints by various social-interest groups: groups trying to ban all public scents, anti-obesity organizations, diabetes organizations, and advocates for the homeless who argued the smell would leave these people hungry and unable to purchase food. There is also evidence that certain smells may be more effective when targeted toward one of the sexes. A vanilla smell diffused into a women's clothing store and a spicy honey smell diffused into a men's clothing store almost doubled sales. When  the scents were reversed, sales fell to levels below what they were when no scent was infused.

#### Header: Hearing
Consumers buy millions of dollars' worth of sound recordings every year, advertising jingles maintain brand awareness, and background music creates desired moods. Many aspects of sound may affect people's feelings and behaviour. Stores and restaurant often play certain kinds of music to create a certain mood. Now even the airlines are looking to audible stimuli to help them board planes more efficiently. When Delta started to play contemporary, upbeat music during the boarding process, flight attendants reported that this seemed to encourage passengers to take their seat faster. Now Delta deliberately chooses a different song lineup each month to help "herd the cattle" and then switches to lulling melodies to help passengers relax before takeoff.
* By decomposing brand names into individual sounds called phonemes, one study showed how even these cues affect consumer evaluations and convey unique meanings about inherent properties of the product. For instance, consumers infer that brands containing the vowel sound of short [i] weigh less than brands containing the vowel sound of [a]. Other research shows that brand names with repetition in their phonetic structure (think clothing brand "bebe: and "jelly Belly" candies) produce positive affect when spoken aloud, leading to increase to preference for the brand.
* Muzak Holding estimates that its recording are heard by 80 million people every day. This so-called "functional music" is played in stores, shopping malls, and office to either relax or stimulate consumers. Research shows that workers tend to slow down during midmorning and midafternoon, so Muzak uses a system it calls "stimulus progression", in which  the tempo of its music increases during those slack times. Muzak has been linked to reductions in absenteeism among factory workers. Even the milk output of cows and egg output of chickens are claimed to increase under its influence.
* As people age, many develop aging ear, which is a loss of the ability to hear higher ferquency sounds. And some teends have figured out that their parents don't have the same range of hearing that they do. Some teens download a speical ring  tone off the Internet to alert them while they're sitting in class to incoming text messages without their teachers knowing about t hem. Ironically , this tone is a spinoff technology originally meant to repel teenagers. A Welsh security company developed what it called the "Mosquito" to help shopkeepers to disperse young people loitering in front of  their stores while leaving adults unaffected. In this case aging ear comes in handy; grownups couldn't hear the high, whining buzz that sent kids running.

### Touch
* Common observation tells us that tactile stimulation is an important sensory channel. Moods are relaxed or stimulated on the basis of sensations of the skin, whether from a luxurious massage or from the bite of a winter wind. Touch has been shown to be a factor in sales interaction. In one study, diners who were touched by waiters gave bigger tips, and food demonstrators in a supermarket who lightly touched customers had better luck getting shoppers to try a new snack product and to redeem coupons for the brand. Another study found that participants who simply touched an item (an inexpensive coffee mug) for 30 seconds or less created a greater level of attachment to the product that boosted what they were willing to pay for it. The classic contoured Coca-Cola bottle also attests to the power of touch. The bottle was designed appropriately 90 years ago to satisfy the request of a U.S bottler for a soft-drink container that people could identify even in the dark.
* Haptic (touch) senses appear to moderate the relationship between product experience and judgment confidence, confirming the common-sense notion that we're more sure about what we perceive when we can touch it. (Of course, this is a major problem for those who sell product online). These researchers found that individuals who scored high on a "need for Touch" scale were especially influenced by this dimension. Those with a high need for touch responded positively to such statements as the following:

                * When walking through stores, I can't help touching all kinds of products
                * Touching products can be fun.
                * I feel more comfortable purchasing a product after physically examining it.

* Britain's Asda grocery chain removed the wrapping from sample packages of several brands of toilet tissue in stores so that shoppers could feel and compare t extures. The result, the retailer says, was soaring sales for its own in-store brand, resulting in a 50 percent increase in shelf space for the line.
* One recent study found that product judgments by individuals who do not normally possess a compulsion to touch products (low autotelics) **are influenced by the "feel" of a package**, while those who do have a compulsion to touch items (high autotelics) do not rely on this cue to infer a product's quality. Subjects were each given a glass of water in flimsy cup that also hold a straw. Half of the subject were told to hold the cup and drink from the straw, while the other half were told to leave the cup on the desk and drink from the straw. Participants who had been identified as high autotelics rated the water the same, regardless of whether or not they touched the cup. However, low autotelics rated the water as worse if they had the opportunity to touch the cup while drinking from it. How can we explain this finding. Presumably, those who like to touch have learned over tijme that "you ca't judge a book by its cover."
* Other research finds that aspects of touch inherent in the retail setting itself might influence consumer evaluations. For example, soft carpeting leads to a greater sense of physical comfort than does hard tiling. Drawing upon this finding, researchers found that when consumers evaluated a product that was close, they use the comfort of  the carpet to compare against and judged the product less positively. However, when consumers judged a product that was moderately far away, their bodily sensations unconsciously guided their product evaluations. Thus, when at a moderate distance away, consumers perceived the product more positively when they stood on the carpet.
* The japanese take this idea of touch a step farther when they practise what they call Kansei engineering, a philosophy that translates customers' feeings into design elements. In one application of this practice, the desingers of the Mazda Miata focused on young drivers who saw the car as an extension of their bodies, a sensation they call the "horse and rider as one". After extensive research, the company discovered that making the stick shift exactly 9.5 centimetres long conveys the optimal feeling of sportiness and control.
* Similar thinking went into the driver's seat of the Chrysler 300C, which is designed to make you feel a bit taller. In auto-industry-speak, the car has a higher H-point, which refers to the location of the seated driver's hip. The change is prompted by the popularity of SUV, pickup trucks, and minivans that make drivers feel like they are riding high on the highway. Ford calls its version "Command Seating" to reinforce the power it wants drivers to feel as  they look down on all those little vehicles buzzing around below them.

### Header: Taste
* Our taste receptors obviously contribute to our experience of many products, and people form strong preferences for certain flavours.
* Specialized companies called "flavour houses" keep busy trying to develop new tastes to please the changing palates of consumers. And scientists are right behind them, developing new devices to test these flavours. Alpha MOS sells a sophisticated electronic tongue for tasting, and is working on what the company's executives call an electronic mouth, complete with artifical saliva, to chew food and disset its flavor. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo use the tongue to test the quality of corn syrups, while Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Roche use the device to develop medicines that don't taste bitter.
* Marketers have also discovered various ways to influence consumers' perceptions of the taste of the product itself. For example, a subtle cue such as the colour of a product (e.g., a darker versus more natural colour of orange juice) can influence perceptions of the actual taste of the product, even when the true taste of the product is exactly the same! Other work finds that advertisements that refer to more than one of the senses ("Stimulate Your Senses") lead to the more positive perceptions than advertisements simply referring to taste along ("Long Lasting Flavour")

#### Header: EXPOSURE
* Exposure is the process by which the consumer comes into contact with the stimulus and has the potential to notice it. We are capable of notice stimli that we are exposed to for even a very short time--if we choose to do so. That's the reasoning behind Cadillac's ads for cars  that can go from zero to 60 miles (96 kilometres) an hour in less than five seconds. Rather than use t he traditional 30 seconds to communicate this mesage, the company ran five-second commercials to make its point.
* Before we consider what people may choose not to perceive, let's consider what they are capable of perceiving.

#### Header Sensory Thresholds
* If you have ever blown a dog whistle and watched pets respond to a sound you can not hear, you know that there are some stimuli people simply are not capable of perceiving. And, of course, some people are better able to pick up sensory information than others. The science that focuses on how the physical environment is integrated into our personal, subjective world is known as **psychophysics.

#### Header: The Absolute Threshold
* When we define t he lowest intensity of a stimulus that can be registered on a sensory channel, we speak of a threshold for that receptor. The absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulation that can be detected on a sensory channel. The sound emitted by a dog whistle is too high to be detecgted by human ears, so this stimulus is beyond our auditory threshold. The absolute threshold is an important consideration in designing marketing stimuli. **A billboard might have the most entertaining copy ever written, but this genius is wasted if the print is too small for passing motorists to see from the highway.**

#### Header: The Differential Threshold
* The **differential threshold** refers to the ability of a sensory system to detect changes in a stimulus or differences between two stimuli. The minimum change in a stimulus that can be detected is also known as the JND (just noticeable difference)
* The issue fo when and if a change will be noticed by consumers is relevant to many marketing situations. Sometimes a marketer may want to ensure that a change is noticed, such as when merchandise is offered at a discount. In other situations, the fact that a change has been made is downplayed, as in the case of price increases or when a product's size is decreased.
* A consumer's ability to detect a difference between two stimuli is relative. A whispered conversation might be unintelligible on a noisy street can suddenly become public and embarrassing knowledge in a quiet library. It is the relative difference between the decibel level of the conversation and its surroundings, rather than loudness of the conversation itself, that determines whether the stimulus will register.
* In the nineteeth century a psychophysicist named Ernst Weber found that the amount of change necessary to be noticed is systematically related to the original intensity of the stimulus. The stronger the inital stimulus, the greater the change must be for it to be noticed. This relationship is known as Weber's law.
* Consider how Weber's law works with respect to a product that has had its price descreased for a special sale. **A rule of thumb used by some retailers is  that a markdown should be at least 20 percent to make an impact on shoppers.** If so, a pair of socks that retails for $10 should be put on sale for $8 (a $2 discount). However, a sports coat selling for $100 would not benefit from a mere $2 discount; it would have to be marked down to $80 to achieve the same impact.
* The main point of Weber's law is that it is the ratios, not the absolute differences, that are important in describing the least perceptible differences in sensory discrimination. The differential threshold varies not only with consumers' sensitivity and type of stimuli, but also with the aboslute intensity of the stimuli being compared. The use of Weber's law in selling goods is important. **Manufacturers and brand managers endeavour to determine the relevant just noticeable difference for their products for two reasons: first, so that reductions in product size, increases in product price, or changes in packaging are not readily discernible to the public; and second, so taht product improvements are perceived by the public.** Unfortunately, most of the timme companies are looking t o give you less, below your JND. The package on the store shelf may register the same to your brain, but the amount inside  the package has gone down. This is how companies tend to pass on their rising costs to customers. Not only are cereal boxes slimmed down, but consumers are dealt more air in their chip bag, fewer sheets of paper towel on the roll, thinner garbage bags, and even smaller squares of toilet paper. Even Coca-Cola has reduced the size of their 355 millilitre can by 7 percent to 330 millilitres in the Hong Kong marketer to save on teh cost of aluminum.

#### Header: Subliminal Perception
* The topic of subliminal perception, t he perception of stimuli below the level of consumer consciousness, has captivated the public for more  than 50 years, despite the fact that there is virtually no proof that it has any effect on consumer behaviour. In fact, most example of subliminal perception that have been "discovered" are not subliminal at all; they are quite visible. Remember, if you can see it or hear it, it is not subliminal, because the stimulus is above the level needed for conscioss awareness! Nonetheless, the continuing controversy about subliminal persuasion has been importan in shaping the public's belief about advertising and the ability of marketers to manipulate consumers against their will.
* The public's fear of unconscious manipulation began with a widely popularized experiment that was eprformed in New Jersey drive-in movie theatre in September 1957. During a showing of the movie Picnic, a firm called the Subliminal Projection Company inserted messages that said "Drink Coca-Cola" and "Eat Popcorn" for 1/3000 second every five seconds. This rate was too fast for vieweres to be aware that they had seen the images. Supposedly, sales of popcorn increased by almost 20 percent and consumption of Coke by almost 60 percent. These claims created an uproar as journalists and social critics expressed fears that social scientists would team up with advertisers to invade privacy and control consumers against their will. As one magazine put it at the time, consumers' minds had been "broken and entered". This experiment was never replicated, and the executive responsible for the test later admitted that he had made up the results.
* Subliminal messages can supposedly be sent on both visual and aural channels. Embeds are tiny figures that are inserted into magazine advertising by using high-speed photography or airbrushing.
* In addition to these subliminal visual messages, many consumers and marketers seem to be fascinated by the possible effects of messages hidden on sound recordings. An attempt to capitalize on subliminal auditory perception techniques is found in the market for self-help cassettes. These tapes, which typically feature the sound of waves crashing or some other natural setting, supposedly contain subliminal messages to help the listener stop smoking, lose weight, gain confidence, and so on. However, there is little evidence that any subliminal stimuli transmitted on the auditory channel can bring about desired changes in behaviour. In a major study conducted to obtain a definitive answer on the effect of subliminal persuasion, groups of people were recruited to a double-blind weight loss experiment involving tapes with subaudible messages. One group had real weight loss messages in their tapes, whiile the other just listened to the ocean. After many weeks of listening to the tapes, there were no differences in weight loss between the two groups.
* Clearly, there are better ways to get our attention. Let's see how.

#### Bigheader: ATTENTION
* As you sit in a lecture, you might find your mind wandering. One minute you are concentrating on the instrutor's words, and the next you catch yourself daydreaming about the upcoming weekend. Suddenly, you tune back in as you hear your name being spoken. Fortunately, it's a false alarm--the professor has called on another student who has the same first name. But she's got your attention now!
* Attention refers to the extent to which the brain's processing activity is devoted to a particular stimulus. As you know from sitting through both interesting and "less interesting" lectures, this allocation can vary depending on the characteristics of both the stimulus (the lecture itself) and the recipient (you with your mental state at the time).
* Although we live in an information society, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Consumers are often in a state of sensory overload; that is, they are exposed to far more information than they are able or willing to process. In our society, much of this bombardment comes from commercial sources, and the competition for our attention is increasing steadily. The average adult is exposed to about 3500 pieces of advertising information every single day--up from about 560 a day 30 years ago. Many young people in particular have developed the ability to multitask, or process information from more than one medium observed 400 people for a day and found that 96 percent of them were multitasking about a third of the time they were using media. Marketing researchers are struggling to understand this new condition, trying to figure out how to reach people doing many things at once.
* As we'll also see in later chapters, marketers are constantly searching for ways to break through the clutter and grab people's attention. For example, marketers are coming up with innovative ways to get consumers' attention in ways that go viral (i.e., the marketing message get passed along from consumer to consumer).

                * From Coca Cola: www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqT_dPApjqU
                * From Volkswagen: www.youtube.com/watch?v=R55e-uHQna0

* Marketers are also using techniques such as guerilla marketing to get noticed. This involves using communications that are unexpected and unconventional in ways that target consumers in unexpected places.

* However, the brain's capacity to process information is limited, and consumers are able to pay attention only to certain stimuli. The process of perceptual selectivity means that people attend to only a small portion of the stimuli to which they are exposed. Consumers practise a form of psychological economy, picking and choosing among stimuli to avoid being overwhelmed. How do they choose? Both personal and stimulus factors help.

#### Subheader: Personal Selection Factors
* Experience, which is the result of acquiring stimulation, is one factor that determines how much exposure to a particular stimulus a person accepts. Perceptual filters based on consumers' past experiences influence what they decide to process.
* Perceptual vigilance is a factor in select exposure. **Consumers are more likely to be aware of stimuli that relate to their current needs. These needs may be conscious or unconscious. A consumer who rarely notices car ads will become very much aware of them when he or she is in the market for a new car. A bus shelter ad for a faster-food restaurant that would otherwise go unnoticed becomes relevant when one waits to catch the bus close to dinner time.
* The flip side of perceptual vigilance is perceptual defence. This means that people see what they want to see--and don't see what they don't want to see. If a stimulus is treatening to us in some way, we may not process it or we may distort its meaning so that it is mroe acceptable. For example, a heavy smoker may block out images of cancer-scarred lungs because these vivid reminders hit a bit too close to home.
* Another factor affecting exposure is adaptation--that is, the degree to which consumers continue to notice a stimulus over time. The process of adaptation occurs when consumers no longer pay attention to a stimulus because it is so familiar. Almost like drug addition, a consumer can becomme "habituated" are require increasingly stronger "doses" of a stimulus for it to continue to be noticed. For example, a consumer en route to work might read a billboard message when it is first installed, but after a few days it becomes part of the passing scenery.
* Generally, several factors can lead to adaptation:

                * Intensity: Consumers become habituated to less-intense stimuli (soft sounds or dim colours) because such stimuli have less of a sensory impact.
                * Duration: stimuli that require relatively lengthy exposure to be processed tend to be habituated to because they require a long attention span.
                * Discrimination: Simple stimuli tend to be habituate to because they do not require attention to detail.
                * Exposure: people tend to habituate to frequently encountered stimuli as the rate of exposure increases.
                * Relevance: people tend to habituate to stimuli that are irrelevant or unimportant because they fail to attract attention.

#### Header: Stimulus Selection Factors
* In addition to the receiver's "mindset", characteristics of the stimulus itself play an important rol in determining what gets noticed and what gets ignored. These factors need to be understood by jmarketers who can apply them to their messages and packages to boost their chances of cutting through the clutter and commanding attention. This idea even applies to getting animals' attention. A British ad agency did a TV commercial aimed at felines that used fish and mouse images and sounds to attract catty consumers. In trials, 60 percent of cats showed some form of response to the ad, from twitching their ears to tapping the TV screen.
* In general, stimuli that differ from others around them are more likely to be noticed (remember Weber's law). This contrast can be created in several ways.
* In general, stimuli that differ from others around them are more likely to be noticed (remember Weber's law.) This contrast can be created in several ways:

        * Size: The size of the stimulus itself in contast to the competition helps to determine whether it will command attention. Readership of a magazine ad increases in proportion to the size of the ad.
        * Colour: As we've seen, colour is a powerful way to draw attention to a product or to give it a distinct identity. For example, Black & Decker has a line of tools called DeWalt targeting the residential construction industry. The line is coloured yellow and black, instead of grey which makes them stand out against other "dull" tools.
        * Position: Not surprisingly, stimuli that are in places where we're more likely to look stand a better chance of being noticed. That's why the compeition among suppliers to have their products displayed at eye level in stores is so heated. In magazines, ads that are placed toward the front of the issue, preferably on the right-hand side, also win out in the race to get readers' attention.
        * One recent study found that the noticeability of warning labels on alcoholic beverages was improved by placing the message on teh front label in a horizontal position and by reducing surrounding clutter. Another study that tracked consumers' eye movements as they scanned telephone directories also illustrates the importance of a message's position. Consumers scanned listings in alphabetical order, and they noticed 93 percent of quarter-page display ads but only 26 percent of plain listings. Their eyes were drawn to colour ads first, and these were viewed longer than black-and-white ones. In addition, subjects spent 54 percent more time viewing ads for businesses they ended up choosing, which illustrates the influence of attention on subsequent product choice.
        * novelty: Communications that use novel stimuli or appear in unexpected places tend to grab our attention. These locations include the backs of shopping carts, public washrooms, and even on other consumers themselves. An example of novelty attracting consumers' attention is Naked Grape wine produced by Vincor. Point-of-sale and advertising taglines say "It takes confidence to go unoaked". Sales have soared for this wine.

### Bigheader: INTERPRETATION
* Interpretation refers to the meanings that people assign to sensory stimuli. Just as people differ in terms of the stimuli they perceive, the eventual assignment of meanings to these stimuli varies as well. Two people can see or hear the same event, but their interpretations of it can be like night and day depending on what they had expected the stimulus to be.
* In one study, three-to-five-year-old kids who ate McDonald's french fries served in a McDonald's bag overwhelmingly thought they tasted better than those who ate the same fries out of a plain white bag. Even carrots tasted better when they came out of a McDonald's bag--more than half the kids preferred them to the same carrots served in a plain package!
* Consumers assign meaning to stimuli based on the schema, or set of beliefs, to which the stimulus is assigned. A schema provides a cognitive framework that helps organize and interpret information that surrounds a particular stimulus, such as a brand for example. A brand name can communicate expectations about product attributes and can colour consumers' perceptions of product performance by activating a relevant schema. For example, when the consumer hears the brand name "Nike", various concepts and associations may come to mind such as "athletic", "trendy", and "empowering". **Identifying and evoking the correct schema is cruicial to many marketing decisions, because this determines what criteria will be used to evaluate the product, package, or message. Nike has worked hard to distance themselves, somemthing that they received negative media attention for in the late 1980s /early 1990s. In another example, Extra-Strength Maalox Whip Antacid flopped even though a spray can is a pretty effective way to deliver the product. But to consumers, aerosol whip mean dessert toppings, not medication. In this case, the schema for aerosol containers could not accommodate such incongruent information. On the other hand, when menu items in a college cafeteria were given descriptive labels (e.g., "Traditional Cajun Red Beans with Rice" versus "Red Bean with Rice", and "Satin Chocolate Pudding" versus "Chocolate Pudding") so that diners had more informatio nabout each option and were able to better categorize them, sales increased by more than 25 percent. Thus, the effective positioning of products can often create more positive associations for consumers.

##### Subheader: Stimulus Organization
* **People do not perceive a single stimulus in isolation; they tend to view it in terms of relationships with other events, sensations, or images.** When Nabisco introduced a version of Teddy Grahams (a children's product) for adults, restrained packaging colour were used to reinforce the idea the the new product was for grownups, but sales were disappointing. The box was then changed to a bright yellow to convey the diea that this was a fun snack, and buyers' more positive association between a bright primary colour and taste led adults to start buying the cookies.
* Our brains tend to relate incoming sensations to others already in memory on the basis of some fundamental organizational principles. These principles derive from work in Gestalt psychology, a school of thought maintaining that people derive meaning from the totality of a set of stimuli rather than from any individual stimulus. The German word gestalt means, roughly, "whole", "pattern", or "configuration", a perspective best summarized by the saying "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts". A piecemeal perspective that analyzes each component of the stimulus separately will be unable to capture the total effect. The importance of a gestalt is underscored when consumers' interpretations of stimuli are affected by aesthetic, symbolic, or sensory qualities. The gestalt perspective provides several principles relating to the way stimuli are organized. 
* The gestalt principle of closure implies that consumers tend to perceive an incomplete picture as complete. That is, we tend to fill in the blanks on the basis of our prior experience. This principle explains why most of us have no trouble fillings in the blanks in an incomplete message or reading a neon sign even if one or two of its letters are burned out. The principle of closure is also at work when we hear only part of a jingle or theme. **Using the principle of closure in marketing strategies encourages audience participation, which increases the chance that people will attend to the message. Research shows that, if marketers want to encourage brand recall, they should omit an element of the advertisement that is directly linked to the brand itself.**
* The principle of similarity tells us that consumers tend to group together objects that share similar physical characteristics; that is, they group like items into sets to form an integrated whole. Green Giant relies on this principle when the company redeisgned the packaging for its line of frozen vegetables. It created a "sea-of-green" look to unify all of its different offerings.
* Another important gestalt concept is the figure-ground principle, in which one part of a stimulus will dominate (the figure) while other parts recede into the background. This concept is easy to understand if one thinks of a photograph with a clear and sharply focused object (the figure) in the centre. The figure is dominant, and the eye goes straight to it. The parts of the configuration that will be perceived as figure or ground can vary, depending on the individual consumer as well as other factors. Similarly, in marketing messages that use the figure-ground principle, a stimulus can be made the focal point of the message or merely the context that surrounds the focus.

### Bigheader: THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: INTERPRETATION BIASES
* The stimuli we perceive are often ambiguous; it's up to us to determine the meaning based on our past experiences, expectations, and needs. The process of "seeing what you want to see" was demonstrated in a classic experiment in which students at Princeton and Dartmouth viewed a movie of a particular rough football game between the two schools. Although everyone was exposed to the same stimulus, the degree to which students saw infractions, and the blame they assigned for those they did see, was quite different depending on which college they attended.
* As this experiement demonstrates, consumers tend to project their own desires or assumptions onto products and advertisements. Another experiment demonstrated how our assumptions influence our experiences; in this case, the study altered beer drinkers' taste preference simply by telling them different stories about a specific brew's ingredient. The researcher offered bar patrons free beer if they would participate in a taste test. Participants tasted two beers each, one a regular draft of Budweiser or Samuel Adams and the other the same beer with a few drops of balsamic vinegar added. Altough most beer aficionados would guess that vinegar makes the drink taste bad, 60 percent of the respondents who did not know which beer contained the vinegar actually preferred the doctored version to the regular one! But when tasters knew in advance which beer had vinegar in it before they took a swig only one-third preferred that version.

##### Subheader: Perceptual Positioning
* As we've seen, a product stimulus is often interpreted in light of what we already know about a product category and the characteristics of existing brands. **Perceptions of a brand comprise both its functional attributes (its features, price, etc.) and its symbolic attributes (its image and what we think it says about us when we use it).** We'll look more closely at issues such as brand image in later chapters, but for now it's important to keep in mind that our evaluation of a product is typically the result of what it means rather than what it does. This meaning, as perceived by consumers, constitutes the product's market position--and it may have more to do with our expectations of product performance as communicated by its colour, packaging, or styling than with the product itself. how does a marketer determine where a product acutally stands in the mind of consumers? **One technique is to ask them what attributes are important to them and how they feel competitors rate on these attributes.**
* A **positioning strategy--or the way the marketer wants the brand to be viewed in the eyes of the consumer--is a fumdamental part of a company's marketing efforts as it uses elements of the marketing mix (product design, price, distribution, and marketing communications) to influence the consumer's interpretation of the brand's meaning. Indeed, brands go to great length to position themselves as distinct from competitors on attributes consumers care about. For example, although most automobile companies tend to position themselves on attributes such as speed, styling, or safety, Subaru has taken a unique approach with their "dog-tested" campaign, targeted at dog owners. The campagin features amusing spots of dogs driving around in a Subaru, in way that surely appeals to dog lovers.
* One issue for marketers is how to **reposition** their brand, in a way that updates the brand's image for an evolving market. Volvo, lately beginning to be seen as a brand for an older demographic and positioned heavily on the safety dimension, in an attempt to update their image have signed an endorsement deal with Jeremy Lin, a young NBA player with a Chinese-American heritage. Not only does this help create a more youthful brand image, but it will likly carry some appeal in the large Chinese market.

###### POSITIONING DIMENSIONS
* There are many dimensions that can be used to establish a brand's position in the marketplace. These include the following:

                * Price leadership: Lancome cosmetics are sold in upscale beauty shops for a higher price, while L'Oreal (which owns Lancome, by the way) products are available for much lower prices in lower-end stores.
                * Attributes: Bounty paper towels are "the quicker picker upper"
                * PRoduct class: The Porsche Boxter is a sporty conventible
                * Occasions: Kit Kat is positioned as a snack to have when it is time to "have a break"
                * Users: Levi's Dockers are targeted primarily at men in their thiries and forties
                * Design: Apply products like the iPad and iPhone are renowned for their smart design.

# Chapter 3: Learning and Memory

## Bigheader: THE LEARNING PROCESS
* The development of vivid memories is relevant to the study of how brand attitudes are formed. Marketers realize that developing long-standing, learned connections between products and memorable experiences is a potent way to build and keep brand loyalty. In this chapter, we'll explore how learned associations among feelings, events, and products--and the memories they evoke--are an important aspect of consumer behaviour.
* **Learning refers to a relatively permanent change in behaviour that is caused by experience. This experience does not have to affect the learner directly, we can learn vicariously by observing events that affect others. We also learn even when we are not trying. Consumers recognize many brand names and can hum many product jingles, even for product categories they themselves do not use. This casual, unintentional acquisition of knowledge is known as incidental learning.**
* Learning is an ongoing process. Our knowledge about the world is constantly being revised as we are exposed to new stimuli and receive ongoing feedback that allows us to modify behaviour in other similar situation at a later time. The concept of learning covers a lot of ground, **ranging from a conumser's simple association between a stimulus such as a product logo (Sprite) and the concept of "refreshing soft drink" to a complex series of cognitive activities (writing an essay on learning about a consumer behaviour exam).** Psychologists who study learning have advanced several theories to explain the learning process. These theories range from those focusing on simple stimulus-response connections (behavioural theories) to perspectives that regard consumers as complex progrm solvers who learn abstract rules and concepts by observing others (cognitive theories). **Understanding these theories is important to marketers as well since basic learning principles are at the heart of many consumer purchase decision.**
* 
### Bigheader: BEHAVIOURAL LEARNING THEORIES
* Behavioural learning theories assume that **learning takes place as the result of responses to external events, as opposed to internal thought process.** Psychologists who subscribe to this viewpoint do not focus on internal cognitive processes. Instead, they approach the mind as a "black box" that can not be directly investigated and emphasize the obeservable aspects of behaviour. These observable aspects consist of things that go into the box (the stimuli or events perceived from the outside world) and things that come out of the box (the responses or reactions to these stimuli). **Take for example, a McDonald's Big Mac as the stimulus and salivating in reaction to this as a response.**
* This view is represented by two major approaches to behavioural learning: classical conditioning and instrumental conditioning. Consumers respond to **brand names, scents, jingles, and other marketing stimuli** on the basis of the learned assocations or connections they have formed over time. Similarly, people also learn that actions they take result in rewards and punishments, and this feedback influences the way they will respond in similar situations in the future. Consumers who receive compliments on a product choice will be more likely to buy that brand again (i.e., a form of positive reinforcement), while those who get food poisoning at a new restaurant will not likely eat there in the future (i.e., a form of punishment)

### Header: Classical Conditioning
* **Classical conditioning** occurs when a stimulus that elicits a response is paired with another stimulus that initally does not elicit a response on its own. Over time this second stimulus causes a similiar response because it is associated with the first stimulus. SKIM Pavlov conditioning
* This basic form of classical conditioning demonstrated by Pavlov applies primarily to responses controlled by the **autonomic (e.g., salivation) and nervous (e.g., eye-blink) systems** That is, it focus on visual and olfactory cues that induce physiological responses, such as **hunger, thirst, or sexual arousal**. When these cues are consistently paired with conditioned stimuli, such as brand names, consumers may learn to feel hungry, thirsty, and aroused when later exposed to the brand cues.
* Classical conditioning effects can also emerge when a product that is originally neutral (e.g., conditioned stimulus) is paired over time with a product that produces an emotion-inducing responses (i.e., an unconditioned stimulus). In one study, for example, participants viewed **pen paired with either pleasant or unpleasant mood-inducing music; and they were much more likely to later select the pen that appeared with pleasant music.** Researchers have shown that **classical conditioning effects can be triggered by unconditioned stimuli such as the Star Wars theme song or pleasant pictures paired with conditioned stimuli such as geometric shapes, colas, and toothpaste.**

### Header: Associative Learning
* Classical conditioning is a form of **associate learning** in which **consumers learn associations between stimuli in a rather simple fashion *without more complex processes such as memory or cognition taking place***. Associative learning can occur for more complex reactions to stimuli as well. **Even a credit card becomes a donditioned cue that triggers greater spending, especially since it is a stimulus present only in stituations in which consumers are spending money. Over time, people may make associations between credit cards and the ability to make larger purchases; and consequently have been found to leave larger tips than they do when using cash. Small wonder that American Express reminds us, "Don't leave home without it".**

###### Subheader: REPETITION
* Associative learning effects are more likely to occur after a conditioned stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus have been paired a number of times. Repeated exposures increase the strength of stimulus-response associations and preven the decay of these associations in memory. Research indiciates that the **interval between exposures may influence the effectiveness of this strategy as well as the type of medium used to communicate the stimulus-response associations; the most effective repetition strategy seems to be a combination of spaced exposures that alternate in terms of media that are more and less involving, such as TV advertising complemented by print media. Many classic advertising campaigns consist of product slogans that have been repeated so many times they are etched in consumers' minds.**
* Associative learning will not occur or will take longer if the paired stimuli are only occasionally presented with one another. One result of this lack of association may be **extinction**, which happens when the effect of prior conditioning are reduced and finally disappear. This can occur, for example, when a product is overexposed in the marketplace, or forms new associations such that the brand is no longer consistenly paired with the original stimulus. **For example, Coach has done an excellent job of pairing their brand with high-end, luxury imagery. When Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi from MTV's Jersey Shore began t o become well known for always being photographed with her Coach purse, Coach became worried that their former luxury-brand association might wear off. The news media reported that Coach had carefully orchestrated a change in her behaviour. By sending her their compeition's (Gucci's products), Coach hoped to decrease the undesirable associations of Snookie being seen using their brand!**

###### STIMULUS GENERALIZATION
* **Stimulus generalization** refers to the tendency of stimuli similar to a CS to evoke similar conditioned responses. For example, Pavlov noticed in subsequent studies that his dogs would sometimes salivate when they hear noises that only resembled the sound of a bell (e.g., keys jingling). **People react to other similar stimuli in much the same way as they respond to an original stimulus. A drug store's bottle of private-brand mouthwash deliberately packaged to resemble Listerine mouthwash may evoke a similar response among consumers who assume that this "me-too" product shares other characteristics of the original.**
* Indeed, consumers in one study on shampoo brands tended to rate those with similar packages as also being similar in quality and performance. This "piggybacking" strategy can cut both ways: When the quality of the me-too product turns out to be lower than that of the original brand, consumers may exhibit even more positive feelings toward the original; however, if the quality of the two competitors is perceived to be about equal, consumers may conclude the price premium they are paying for the original is not worth it. In addition, consumers' learned associations with a large corporation can influence what they believe about its product. The company's overall reputation has been shown to have a particularly strong impact on brand evaluations. To a lesser extent the same is also true of the company's reputation for social responsibility.

###### Subheader: STIMULUS DISCRIMINATION
* **Stimulus discrimination** occurs when a stimulus similar to a conditioned stimulus is not followed by a unconditioned stimuli. **In these situations reactions are weakened and will soon disappear.** Part of the learning process involves learning to respond to some stimuli but not to other similar stimuli. Manufacturers of well-established brands commonly encourage consumers to discriminate by urging them not to buy "cheap imitations" because the results will not be what they expect.
* In a recent twist on this principle some companies are using a strategy called **masked branding**, which deliberately hides a product's true origin. For example, Rickard's Red beer is positioned to compete with microbreweries, and the label lists the manufacturer as the Capilano Brewing Co. even though the beer is actually made by Molson Coors. In this case, the marketers have worked hard to encourage stimulus discrimination; **they do not want consumers to have the same conditioned response to "Rickard's Red as t hey do to Coors Light, for example.**

### Header: Marketing Applications of Conditioning
* Many marketing strategies focus on the establishment of associations between stimuli and responses. Behavioural learning principles apply to many consumer phenomena, ranging from the creation of a distinctive brand image to the perceived link between a product and an underlying need.
* These conditioned associations are crucial to many marketing strategies that rely on the creation and perpetuation of **positive brand equity, in which a brand has strong postive associations in a conumser's memory and commands a lot of loyalty as a result.** As we will see in the following chapters, a product with brand equity holds a tremendous advantage in the marketplace.

###### Subheader: REPETITION
* One advertising researcher argues that scheduling more than three exposures is a waste. **The first exposure creates awareness of the product, the second exposure demonstrate its relevance to the consumer, and the third exposure serves as a reiminder of the product's benefit.** However, even this bare-bones approach implies that repetition is needed to ensure t hat the consumer is actually exposed to (and processes) the ad at least three times. As we saw in the last chapter, this exposure is **by no means guaranteed since people often tune out or distort many marketing communications.** Marketers attempting to condition a particular association must ensure that the consumers they have targeted will be exposed to the stimulus a sufficient number of times to make it "stick".
*  On the other hand, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Consumers can becomme so used to hearing or seeing a marketing stimulus that they no longer pay attention to it. The problem, known as **advertising wearout**, can be alleviated by varying the way in which the basic message is presented. For example, the marketer can maintain the themes and association conveyed by an advertising message, **while varying the actual execution of the message itself. **A good example of this is the "Got Milk" campaign, which pairs unconditioned stimuli (attractive celebrities) with the product (which presumably leads to the unconditioned response of positive affect), but varies the actual celebrities used to avoid consumers getting bored or blocking out the marketing messages.**

###### Subheader: CONDITIONING PRODUCT ASSOCIATIONS
* Advertisements often pair a product with a positive stimulus to create a desirable association. Various aspects of a marketing message, such as music, humour, or imagery, can affect conditioning.
* **Importantly, the order in which the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus are presented can affect the likelihood that learning will occur. Generally speaking, the unconditioned stimulus should be presented prior to the conditioned stimulus. That is, it is more effective to play a jingle (UCS) and then follow this with the presentation of a soft drink (CS). The technique of backward conditioning, such as showing a soft drink (the CS) and then playing a jingle (the UCS) is generally not effective.**
* Just as product associations can be formed, they can also be extinguished. **Because of the danger of extinction, a classical conditioning strategy may not be as effective for products that are frequently encountered, since there is no guarantee they will be consistently accompanied by the CS.** A bottle of Pepsi paired with the refreshing sound of a carbonated beverage being poured over ice may seem like a good example of conditioning. Unfortunately, the product would also be seen in many other contexts in which this sound was absent, reducing the effectiveness of  the conditioning strategy. By the same reasoning, **a novel tune** should be chosen over a popular one to pair with a product, since the popular song might also be heard in many situation in which the product is not present.

###### Subheader: APPLICATIONS OF STIMULUS GENERATION
* The process of stimulus generalization is often central to branding and packaging decisions that attempt to capitalize on consumers' positive associations with an existing brand or company name. The marketing value of an admired stimulus is clearly demonstrated at universities with winning sports team, where loyal fans snap up merchandise, from clothing to bathroom accessories, emblazoned with the school's name. This business did not even exist 40 years ago, when schools were reluctant to commercialize their images. Today, it's a different story. Many university administrators crave the revenue they receive from sales of products that range from sweatshirts to drink coasters. **Strategies based on stimulus generalization include the following:**

                * Family branding, in which a variety of products capitalize on the reputation of a company name. Companies such as Google, Virgin, Campbell, Heinz, and General Electric rely on their positive corporate images to sell different lines.
                * Product-line extensions, in which related products are added to an established brand. Dole, which is associated with fruit, was able to introduce refrigerated juices and juice bars, while Sun-Maid went from raisins to raisin bread. Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble is cleaning up with its Mr. Clean brand of liquid cleaner, aggressively putting the name on products such as Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, for removing crayon marks from walls and scuff marks from the chair rails, and Mr. Clean AutoDry, for leaving a freshly washed car spot-free without hand drying.
                * Licensing, in which well-known names are "rented" by others. This strategy is increasing in popularity as marketers try to link their products and services with well-established brands. Prevention magazine introduced vitamins, Runner's World magazine attempted to put its name on jogging suits. Maxim magazine brought out its own brand of hair colour for men, and at one point considered putting its name on night clubs and frozen food.
                * Look-alike packaging, in which distinctive packaging designs create strong associations with a particular brand. This link is often exploited by makers of generic or private-label brands that wish to communicate a quality image by putting their products in similar packages. Imitating the look of an existing successful brand is common in today' crowded marketplace. However, one study found that a negative experience with an imitator brand increased evaluations of the original brand. A positive experience with the imitator had the opposite effect of decreasing evaluations of the original brand. Another study found that consumers tend to react positively to "copycat brands" as long as the imitator doesn't make grandiose claims that it can't fulfill.

* Of course, this strategy can make a lot of work for lawyers if the copycat brand gets too close to the original. Marketers or distinctive brands work hard to protect their designs and logos, and every year companies file numerous lawsuits that hinge on the issue of "consumer confusion"--how likely is it that one company's logo, product design, or package is similar enough to another that the typical shopper would mistake one for the other. For example, Levi Strauss has sued almost 100 other apparel manufacturers that it claims have borrowed its trademark pocket design or the distinctive tab sewn into its garments' vertical seams.
* Companies with a well-established brand image try to encourage stimulus discrimination when they promote the unique attributes of their brand. One big issue arises when fake products masquerade as the real thing. The international AntiCounterfeiting Coalition, an industry group that combats piracy, estimates that trademark counterfeiting robs legitimate brand owners of $200 billion annually. As you might imagine, companies like Louis Vuitton go to great lengths to educate their consumers about the unique attributes of an original product and how to differentiate a true LV from an imposter.

### Header: Instrumental Conditioning
* **Instrumental conditioning** also known as operant conditioning, occurs as the individual learns to perform behaviours that produce positive outcomes and to avoid behaviours that yield negative outcomes. This learning process is most closely associated with the psychologist B.F Skinner, who demonstrated the effects of instrumental conditioning by teaching animals to dance, play Ping Pong, and so on by systematically rewarding them for desired behaviours.
* Under classical conditioning, people respond involuntarily and fairly simply, often on the basis of very automatic responses. Under instrumental conditioning, people perform more complex behaviours and associate these behaviours with either rewards or punishments. The desired behaviour may be learn over a period of time, as intermediate actions are rewarded in a process called **shaping**. Shaping occurs when consumers are rewarded for successive steps taken toward the desired response. For example, **the owner of a new store might award samples to shoppers just for oming into the store in a way that encourage trial, the nprovide consumers with coupons that stimulates low-involvement purchases, then reward consumers for signing up for a reward program, and then finally reward them again when they come into the store and buy something more substantial.**
* Also, classical conditioning involves the close pairing of two stimuli. Instrumental learning occurs as a result of a reward received following the desired behaviour and takes place over a period in which a variety of other behaviours are attempted and abandoned because they are not reinforced. A good way to remember the difference is to keep in mind that in instrumental learning the response is performed because it is instrumental to gaining a reward or avoiding a punishment. Over time, consumers come to choose products that make them feel good or satisfy some social need and to associate with people who reward them.
* Instrumental learning occurs in one of three ways. When the environment provides positive reinforcement in the form of a reward, the response is strengthened and appropriate behaviour is learned. For example, **a woman who gets compliments after wearing a certain brand of perfume will learn that using this product has the desired effect, and she will be more likely to keep buying the product.** **Similarly, a user who gets a large number of "likes" on his Facebook status for posting humourous content, will be increasingly likely to do so again.** **Negative reinforcement** also strengthens responses so that appropriate behaviour is learned. Negative reinforcement removes something negative in a way that increases a desired response. **For example, when the retailer offers to pay the tax for the consumer, it is removing a negative stimulus (the tax) in a way that encourages the desired behaviour--making a purchase today.**
* In contrast, to reinforcement strategies that are used when marketers want to increase a particular behaviour, punishment is used to decrease an undesired behaviour. Punishment occurs when a response is followed by an unpleasant event. **For example, being ridiculed by friends for wearing an offensive cologne or having the heel of your shoe rip off after buying a cheap pair would both be examples of punishment in the consumer context.** We learn not to repeat these behaviours.
* In terms of positive and negative reinforcement, when a positive outcome is no longer received, extinction of the behaviour is likely to occur and the learned stimulus response connection will not be maintained (as when a woman no longer receives compliment on her perfume). Thus, either positive or negative reinforcement strengthens the future link between a response and an outcome because of the pleasant experience. This tie is weakened under conditions of both punishment and extinction because of the unpleasant experience. The relationship among these four conditions are easier to understand

#### Header: Four Types of Learning Schedules
* An important factor in operant conditioning is the set of rules by which appropriate reinforcements are given for a behaviour. The issue of what is the most effective reinforcement schedule to use is important to marketers, because it relates to the amount of effort and resources they must devote to rewarding consumers to condition desired behaviours. Two general ways in which consumers are reinforced for desired behaviours include ratio schedules and interval schedules. Ratio schedules reinforce the learner based on the number of responses that have been completed. **For example, rewarding the consumer with a free gift after ten purchases is an example of a ratio reinforcement schedule.** Interval schedules, on the other hand, **reinforce the learner after a certain amount of time passes since the appropriate response.** For example, you might be rewarded once a year by your bank for being a valued customer.
* Drawing on this, several schedules are possible:

                1. Fixed-ratio reinforcement: Reinforcement occurs only after a fixed number of responses. **For example, a consumer might keep buying at the same store to earn a prize, knowing that after they make 14 purchases, they get their 15th purchase for free.**
                2. Variable-ratio reinforcement: The behaviour of a person is reinforced after a certain number of responses, but he or she does not know how many responses are required. **People in such situations tend to respond at very high and steady rates, and this type of behaviour is very difficult to extinguish. An example of this is Tim Horton's "Roll Up the Rim to Win" campaign. Consumers' chances of winning are based on a behaviour (buying a cup of coffee), but the consumer is not certain how many times they have to engage in the behaviour before they get the reward--anything from a free donut to a Toyata Camry Hybrid.**
                3. Fixed-interval reinforcement: After a specified time period has passed, the first response is made brings the reward. Under such conditions, people tend to respond slowly right after being reinforced, but their responses speed up as the time for the next reinforcement looms. **For example, consumers may crowd into a store for the last day of its seasonal sale and not reappear until the next sale.**
                4. Variable-interval reinforcement: The time that must pass before reinforcement is delivered varies around some average. Since the person does not know exactly when to expect the reinforcement, responses must be performed at a consistent rate. **Take for example, a loyalty club member at a spa who gets mailed a coupon for a free facial once every eight to ten months.**

#### Header: Application of Instrumental Conditioning Principles
* Principles of instrumental conditioning are at work when a consumer is rewarded or punished for a purchase decision. For example, consumers who are rewarded in online marketplaces with discounts, bonus products, or even involving content are more likely to return again. Marketers often use shaping by gradually reinforcing consumers for taking appropriate actions. For example, **a car dealer might encourage a reluctant buyer just to sit in a floor model, then suggest a test drive, and then try to close the deal. In a particularly ingenious example of shaping, Toyota Canada encourages consumers to take their vehicles for a weekend--a fairly big step in the shaping process.**
* One interesting example of positive reinforcement is foursquare, a social platform, allowing consumers to "check in" to locations such as venues, events, and business. These "check-in" get streamed through other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook; allowing friends to keep track of the consumers' whereabouts. The foursquare site provides prositive reinforcement to consumers by rewarding them for visiting certain businesses with badges and points. And if you are the consumer to visit a particular venue the most, you will be dubbed the "mayor", which may come with rewards such as free swag from the company!

###### Subheader: REINFORCEMENT OF CONSUMPTION
* Marketers use many ways to reinforce the behaviour of consumers, **ranging from a simple "thank you" after a purchase to substantial rebates and follow-up phone calls.** **For example, a life insurance company obtained a much higher rate of policy renewal among a group of new customers who received a thank-you letter after each payment compared with a control group that did not receive any reinforcement.**

###### Subheader: FREQUENCY MARKETING
* A popular technique known as **frequency marketing** reinforces the behaviour of regular purchasers by giving them prizes with values that increase along with the amount purchased. This operant learning strategy was pioneerd by the airline industry, which introduced "frequent flyer" programs in the early 1980s to reward loyal customers.
* Frequent-buyer programs are not just about consumers earning free trips and merchandise. Retailers can use related databases to refine everything from their merchandise mix to their marketing strategy on the basis of their detailed knowledge of consumers and their purchases. Costs are lowered by the ability to design focused and personalized marketing communications to the prime customer, customer retention programs are more effective, product launches and redesigns are more likely to be successful, and blunders are prevented.

## Bigheader: COGNITIVE LEARNING THEORY
* In contrast to behaviour theories of learning, **cognitive learning theory** stresses the importance of internal mental processes. This perspective views people as problem solvers who actively use information from the world around them to master their environment. Supporters of this viewpoint also stress the role of creativity and insight during the learning process.
* **An Ocean Spray commmercial for diet cranberry juice illustrates how marketers can harness their knowledge of cognitive learning theories to tweak marketing messages. The spot features two men, in the role of cranberry growers, standing knee-deep in a bog. A group of women who are exercising joins them. Originally the ad depicted the women having a party, but a cognitive scientist who worked on the campaign nixed that idea; she argued that the exercise class would send the diet message more quickly whereas the party scene would confuse viewers who would spend too much time trying to figure out why the group was celebrating. This extra cognitive activity would distract from the ad's message. And, contrary to the standard advertising practice of mentioning the product as early as possible, she decided that the main characters should wait a few seconds before mentioning the new diet product. She reasoned that viewers would need a few more seconds to process the images, because of the additional action in the ad (the exercising). In a test of which ads get remembered best, this new version scored in teh top 10 percent.**

#### Header: Is Learning Conscious or Not?
* A lot of controversy surrounds the issue of whether or when people are aware of their learning processes. While behavioural learning theorists emphasize the routine, automatic nature of conditioning, proponents of cognitive learning argue that even  these simple effects are based on cognitive factors; that is, expectations are created that a stimulus will be followed by a response (the formation of expectation requires mental activity). According to this school of thought, conditioning occurs because individuals develop conscious hypotheses and then act on them.
* On the one hand, there is some evidence for the existence of unconscious procedural knowledge. People apprantly do process at least some information in an automatic, passive way, which is a condition that has been termed *mindlessness*. When you meet someone new or encounter a new product, for example, we have a tendency to respond to the stimulus in terms of existing categories rather than taking the  trouble to formulate different ones. Our reactions are activated by a trigger feature--some stimulus that cues us toward a particular pattern. For example, men in one study rated a car in an ad as superior on a vareity of characteristics if a seductive woman (the trigger feature) was present, despite the fact that the men did not believe the woman's presence actually had an influence on their evaluation.
* Another recent study also illustrates this process. Undergraduates who were on their way to participate in a psychology experiment "accidentally" encountered a laboratory assistant who was laden with textbooks, aclipboard, papers, and a cup of hot or iced coffe and who asked for help with the cup. Guess what? The students who held a cup of iced coffee rated a hypothetical person they later read about as much colder, less social, and more selfish than did those who had helped out by holding a cup of hot coffee. Other researcher report similar findings: People tidy up more thoroughly when there's a faint aroma of cleaning liquid in the air, and they act more competitively if there's a briefcase in the room. In each case, they change their behaviour without being aware of doing so. Indeed, the bestselling book titled *Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking* argues that we often make snap judgment that result in decisions superior to those we think about a lot, because we rely on our "adaptive unconscious" to guide us.
* Nonetheless, many modern theorists are beginning to regard some instances of conditioning as cognitive processes, especially where expectations are formed about the links between stimuli and responsees. Indeed, studies using *masking effects*, wherein it is difficult for subjects to consciously learn CS/UCS associations, show substantial reduction in conditioning. An adolescent girl may observe that women on TV and in real life seem to be rewarded with compliments and attention when they smell nice and wear alluring clothing. She figures out that the probability of these rewards occuring is greater when she wears perfume, and so she deliberately wears a popular scent to obtain the reward of social acceptance.

### Header: Observational Learning
* **Observational learning** occurs when people watch the actions of others and note the reinforcements they receive for their behaviours; learning occurs as a result of vicarious rather than direct experience. Importantly, while behavioural learning theories propose that individual must directly experience the stimuli that influence their behaviours, cognitive learning theories can account for vicarious learning effects. This type of learning is complex cognitive process; people store these observations in memory as they accumulate knowledge, perhaps using this information at a later point to guide their own behaviours. This process of imitating the behaviour of others is called *modeling. For example, **a woman shopping for a new kind of perfume may remember the reactions a frient received upon wearing a certain brand several months earlier, and she may base her purchase on her friend's experiences.**
* The modelling process is a powerful form of learning, and people's tendencies to imitate others' behaviours can have negative effects. Of particular concern is the potential of TV shows and movies to teach violence to children. Children may be exposed to new methods of aggression by models (e.g., cartoon heroes) in the shows they watch. At some later point the child may imitate these behaviours when he or she becomes angry.
* For observational learning in the form of modelling to occur, four conditions must be met (which are summarized in Figure 3-3):

1. The consumer's attention must be directed toward the appropriate model whom, for reasons of attractiveness, commpetence, status, or similarity, it is desirable to emulate.
2. The consumer must remember what the model says or does
3. The consumer must convert this informaiton into acitons.
4. The consumer must be motivated to perform these actions


                Figure 3-3
                ATTENTION: The consumer focuses on a model's behaviour-> RETENTION: The consumer retains this behaviour in memory->PRODUCTION PROCESSES: The consumer has the ability to perform the behaviour-> MOTIVATION: A situation wherein the behaviour is useful to the consumer. -> OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING: The consumer acquires and performs the behaviour demonstrated earlier by a model

* Consumers' evaluations of the people they model go beyond simple stimulus-response connection. For example, **a celebrity's image often provokes more than a simple reflexive response of good or bad. It is a complex commbination of many attributes. In general, the degree to which a model will be emulated depends on his or her social attractiveness. Attractiveness can be based upon several components, including physical appearance, expertise, or similarity to the evaluator

## BigHeaderL THE ROLE OF MEMORY IN LEARNING
* **Memory** involvevs a process of acquiring information and storing it over time so that it will be available when needed. Contemporary approaches to the study of memory employ an information-processing approach. They assume that the mind is in some ways like a computer: Data are input, processed, and output for later use in revised form. In the encoding stage, information is entered in a way the system will recognize. In the storage stage, this knowledge is integrated with what is already in memory and "warehoused" until needed. During retrieval, the mind accesses the desired information. The memory process is summarized in Figure 3-4.
* Many of our experiences are locked inside our heads and may surface years later if prompted by the right cues. Marketers rely on consumers to retain information they have learned about products and services, trusting that they will later apply it when they decide to buy. During the consumer decision-making process, the internal memory is combined with external memory--which includes all of the product details on packages, in shopping lists, and through other marketing stimuli--to permit brand alternatives to be identified and evaluated. The grocery shopping list is a good example of a powerful external memory aid. When consumers use shopping lists, they buy appropriately 80 percent of the tiems on the list, and the likelihood of a particular list item being purchased is higher if the person who wrote the list also participates in the shopping trip. Marketers also found that the likelihood of purchasing a list  item increased with household size and is marginally greater during holidy periods. This means that if marketers can induce a consumer to play to buy an item in advance of shopping, the probability of the item being purchase is high. One suggested way to encourage purchasing would be provide peel-off stickers on packages so that when the consumer notice the supply is low, the consuemr can peel of the label and place it directly onto a shopping list.
* Research supports the idea that marketers can distort a consumer's recall of a product experience. What we think we "know" about products can be influenced by advertising messages to which we are exposed after using the products. This postexperience advertising is more likely to alter actual memories when it is very similar to or activates memories about the actual experience. For example, advertising can make a rememberd product experience more favourable than it actually was.

### Header: Encoding of Information for Later Retrieval
* The way information is encoded helps to determine how it will represented in memory. Encoding involves linking new information to existing knowledge in order to make the new information more meaningful. In general, incoming data that are associated with other information already in memory  stand a better chance of being retained. For example, **brand names that are linked to physical characteristics of a product category (Coffee-mate creamer or Sani-Flush bowl cleaner) or that are easy to visualize (Tide detergent or Jaguar cars) tend to be more easily retained in memory than more abstract brand names.**
* However, memory for brand names may interact with one's involvement in the product class. Low-involvement products, such as household cleaners, seem to benefit from descriptive names by being easier to remember. **There is no evidence that descriptive names for high-involvement products, such as automobiles, are remembered any better than non-descriptive names.**

###### Subheader: TYPES OF MEANING
* A consumer may process a stimulus simply in terms of its sensory meaning, such as its colour of shape. When this occurs the meaning may be activated when the person sees a picture of the stimulus. We may experience a sense of familiarity upon seeing an ad for a new snack food we taste recently, for example. In many cases, though, meanings are encoded at a more abstract level. Semantic meaning refers to symbolic associations, such as the idea that rich people drink champagne.

###### Subheader: PERSONAL RELEVANCE
* Episodic memories are memories for events that are personally relevant. As a result, a person's motivation to retain these memories will likely be strong. Couples often have a song that reminds them of their first date or their wedding. Often an important and compelling episodic event, such as one's wedding, will lead to memories that are quite vivid and unique, and are sometimes called flashbulb memories.
* One method of conveying product information is through a narrative or a story. Much of the social information that an individual acquires is represented in memory this way. Therefore, using this method in product advertising can be an effective marketing technique. Narratives persuade people to construct a mental representation of the information they are viewing. Pictures aid in  this construction and allow for a more developed and detailed mental representation. Recent research supports the idea that brands are more likely to be postively evaluated and purchased when they connect to a consumer through a narrative.

### Header: Memory Systems
* According to the information-processing perspective, there are three distinct memory systems: sensory memory, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory(LTM). Each plays a role in processing information. The interrelationships of these memory systems are summarized in Figure 3-5.
* **Sensory memory** permits storage of the information we receive from our senses. This storage is very temporary; it lasts a couple of seconds at most. For example, a person might be walking past a doughnut shop and get a quick enticing whiff of something baking inside. While this sensation would last for only a few seconds, it would be sufficient to allow the person to determine whether he or she should investigate futher. If the information is retained for further processing, it passes through an attentional gate and is tranferred to short-term memory.
* **Short-term memory** also stores information for a limited period of time, and its capacity is limited. As with the RAM in a computer, this system can be regarded as working memory; it holds the information we are currently processing. Vebal input may be stored acoustically (in terms of how it sounds) or semantically (in terms of its meaning)
* The information is stored by commbining small pieces into larger ones in a process known as chunking. A chunk is a configuration that is familiar to the person and can be manipulated as a unit. For example, a brand name can be a chunk that summarizes a great deal of detailed information about the brand.
* Initially it was believed that STM was capable of processing between five and nine chunks of information at a time, and for this reason phone numbers were designed to have seven digits. It now appears that three to four chunks is the optimum size for efficient retrieval (10-digit phone numbers can be remembered because the individual digits are chunked, so we may remeber a three-digit exchange as one piece of information)
* Long-term memory is the system that allows us to retain information for a long period of time. For information to enter into long-term memory from short-term memory, elaborative rehearsal is required. This process involves thinking about the meaning of a stimulus and relating it to other information already in memory. **Marketers sometimes assist in the process by devising catchy slogans or jingles that consumers repeat on their own.**

### Header: Storing Information In Memory
* Relationships among the types of memory are a source of some controversy. The traditional perspective, known as multiple-store, assumes that STM and LTM are separate systems. More recent research has moved away from the distinction between the two types of memory, instead emphasizing the interdependence of the system. This work argues that, depending on the nature of the processing task, different levels of processing occur that activate some aspects of memory rather than others. These approaches are called **activation models of memory**. The more effort it takes to process information (so-called deep processing), the more likely it is that information will be placed in long-term memory.

###### ASSOCIATIVE NETWORK MODELS
* Associative network models propose that an incoming piece of information is stored in an associative network containing many bits of related information organized according to some set of relationships. The consumer has organized systems of concepts relating to brands, stores, manufacturers, etc. **Associative network models assume that it is the assocations that form in consumers' minds that lead to learning about brands and products. For example, the more times a brand name (i.e., Volvo) becomes associated with a trait or benefit (i.e., safety) in memory, the stronger the link between the brand and the benefit becomems, particularly if the brand and the benefit are uniquely associated.**
* These storage units, known as **knowledge structures**, can be thought of as complex spiderwebs filled with pieces of data. Information is placed into nodes, which are connected by associative links within these structures. Pieces of information seen as similar or associated in some way are chunked together under some more abstract category. New, incoming information is interpreted to be consistent with the structure already in place. According to the hierarchical processing model, a message--an ad, for instance--is processed in a bottom-up fashion: Processing begins at a very basic level and is subject to increasingly complex processing operations that require greater cognitive capacity. If processing at one level fails to evoke the next level, processing of t he ad is terminated and capacity is allocated to other tasks.
* Links form between nodes as an associative network is developed. For example, a consumer might have a network for "perfumes". Each node represents a concept related to the category. This node can be an attribute, a specific brand, a celebrity identified with a perfume, or even a related product. A network for perfumes might include concepts such as the names Chanel, Obsession, and Calvin Klein, as well as attributes such as sexy and elegant.
* When asked to list perfumes, the consumer would recall only those brands contained in the appropriate category. This group constitutes that person's **evoked set** (something we discuss in greater detail in Chapter 9). The task of a new entrant that wants to position itself as a category member (e.g., a new luxury perfume) is **to provide cues that facilitate its placement in the appropriate category.**

###### Subheader: SPREADING ACTIVATION
* A meaning can be activated indirectly; energy spreads across nodes of varying levels of abstraction. As one node is activated, other nodes associated with it also begin to be triggered. Meaning thus spreads across the network, bringing up concepts including competing brands and relevant attributes that are used to form attitudes toward the brand.
* This process of **spreading activation** allows consumers to shift back and forth between levels of meaning. The way a piece of information is stored in memory depends on the type of meaning assigned to it. This meaning type will, in turn, determine how and when the meaning is activated. For example, the memory trace for an ad could be stored in one or more of the following ways:

                1. Brand-specific: in terms of claims made for the brand
                2. Ad-specific: In terms of the medium or content of the ad itself
                3. Brand identification: in terms of the brand name
                4. Product category: in terms of how the product works, where it should be used, or experiences with the product
                5. Evaluative reactions: in terms of whether "that looks like fun"

* LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE      Knowledge is coded at different levels of abstraction and complexity. Meaning concepts are individual nodes (e.g., elegant). These may be combined into a larger unit, called a proposition (also known as a belief). A proposition links two nodes together to form a more complex meaning, which can serve as a single chunk of information. For example, a proposition might be that "Chanel is a perfume for elegant women".
* Propositions are, in turn, integrated to produce a complex unit known as a schema. As was noted in Chapter 2, **a schema is a cognitive framework that is developed through experience.** Information consistent with an existing schema is encoded more readily. The ability to move up and down among levels of abstraction greatly increases processing flexibility and efficiency. For this reason, young children, who do not yet have well-developed schemas, are not able to make as efficient use of purchase information as older children.
* One type of schema that is relevant to consuemr behaviour is a script--a sequence of procedures that is expected by an individual. For example, connsumers learn service scripts that guide expectations and purchasing behaviour in business settings. Consumers learn to expect a certain sequence of events and may become uncomfortable if the service departs from mthe script. A service script for your visit to the dentist might include events such as the following: 1) driving to the dentist, 2) reaindg old magazines in the waiting room, 3) hearing your name called and sitting in the dentist's chair, 4) haiving the dentist put a funny substance on your teeth. 5) having the dentist clean your teeth, and so on. This desire to follow a script helps to explain why such service innovations as automatic bank machines and self-service gas stations initially met with resistance by some consumers who had trouble adapting to a new sequence of events.

### Analogical Learning
* One implication of the notion of these cognitive structures that exist in memory is that it helps to explain ways marketers can help consumers learn new information: something that marketers often care about when introducing new and innovative products. One way consumers can learn about new products and features is through **annological learning**. If the marketer wants to inform or educate the consumer about a new product, the marketer might do so by drawing an analogy (i.e., highlighting similarities) between the new product and an existing product.
* In analogical learning, the existing product is called the **base** (as it is the original source of knowledge) and the new product is called the **target** (as this is what the existing knowledge will be transferred to). Analogical learning occurs because the consuemr can easily integrate existing knowledge from the base into the formation of the new knowledge structure (e.g., the schema for the targe) regarding the new product. For example, **when Liserine first introduced their new Fresh Burst Breath Strips, which dissolve on the tongue and freshen breath, they compared the new product to a well-established and familiar existing product--Listerine Mouthwash--to highlight the ability of the new product to fresh breath.
* Analogical learning can take one of two forms. First, it may occur at the level of **attributes**, which are identifialbe features or properties of the product. In the example of the Listerine breath strips, realizing that a previous product and the new product both come in distinctive green packaging would be an example of attribute-based learning. Second, analogical learning can occur at the level of relations. **relations** refer to how the product relates to a desired outcomme. In the example above, realizing that both mouthwash and the fresh strips can serve to freshen breath highlights a relational analogy. Importantly, what types of analogies are most effective may depend on the target market; while experts represent product information in terms of relational features, novices tend to think about products more in terms of attributes. For example, **a professional golfer will learn about a new innovative golfing product by relating its performance (e.g., sing speed) to previous clubs that he or she has used. In contrast, a novice golfer would be more likely to understand a new innovative golf product by comparing its physical attributes (e.g., size of club head) to golf clubs that he or she had previously seen.

### Header: Retrieving Information for Purchase Decisions
* Retrieval is the process of accessing information from long-term memory. As evidenced by the popularity of the TV show *Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?* people have a vast quantiy of information sotred in their heads that is not necessarily available on demand. Although most of the information entered into long-term memory does not go away, it may be difficult or impossible to retrieve unless the appropriate cues are present.

###### Sbuheader: FACTORS INFLUENCING RETRIEVAL
* Some differences in retrieval ability are physiological. Older adults consistently display inferior recall ability for current items, such as prescription information, though events that happened to them when they were younger may be recalled with great clarity.
* Other factors are situational, relating to the environment in which the message is delivered by commparing energy production to a natural process. Not surprisingly, recall is enhanced when the consumer pays more attention to the message in the first place. Somme evidence indicates that information about a pioneering brand (the first brand to enter a market) is more easily retrieved from memory than follower brands because the product's introduction is likely to be distinctive and, for the itme being, no commpetitors divert the consumer's attention. In addition, in the case of low-involvement products, descriptive brand names are more likely to be recalled than those that do not provide adequate cues about what the product is.
* The viewing environment of a marekting message ccan also affect recall. For example, commercials shown during baseball games yield the lowest recall scores among sports programs because the activity is stop-and-go rather than continuous. Unlike hockey or baseketball, the pacing of baseball gives many opportunities for attention to wander, even during play. Similarly, General Electric found that its commercials fare better in TV shows with continuous activity, such as stories or dramas, compared with variety shows or talk shows punctuated by a series of acts. Finally, a large-scale analysis of TV commercials found that commmercials shown first in a series of ads are recalled better than those shown last.
* Recent research on postexperience advertising effects underscores how powerful marketing communications can be in shaping our daily experiences. Language imagery from ads we have seen recently can become confused with our own experiential memories so that we may come to believe that what we saw in advertising actually was our own experience with products. **One study showed that when consumers were exposed to advertising after they had directly experienced a product, the ad altered their recollections of the experience.**
* FAMILARITY AND RECALL    As a general rule, prior familiarity with an item enhances its recall. Indeed, this is one of the basic goals of marketers who are trying to create and maintain awareness of their products. The more experience a consumer has with a product, the better use that person is able to make of a product information.
* however, there is a possible fly in teh ointment. As noted earlier in this chapter, some evidence indiciates that extreme familiarity can result in inferior learning and recall. When consumers are highly familiar with a brand or an adveritsement, they may attent to fewer attributes because they do not believe that any additional effort will yield a gain in knowledge. For example, when consumers are exposed to the technique of radio replay, in which the audio track from a TV ad is replayed on teh radio, they do very little critical, evaluative processing and instead mentally replay the video portion of the ad.
* SALIENCE AND RECALL    The **salience** of a brand refers to its promminence or level of activation in memory. As noted in Chapter 2, stimuli that stand out in contrast to their environment are more likely to command attention, which in turn increases the likelihood that they will be recalled. Almost any technique that increases the novelty of a stimulus also imporve recall (a result known as the von Restorff effect). This effect explains why unusual advertising or distinctive packaging tends to facilitate brand recall.
* Introducing a surprise element into an ad (such as the Energizer Bunny, who unexpectedly marches through a commercial) can be particularly effective in aiding recall even if the stimulus is not relevant to the factual information being presented. **In addition, so-called mystery ads, in which the brand is not identified until the end of the ad, are more effective at building assocations in memory between the product category and that brand--especially in teh case of relatively unknown brands.** And the intensity and type of emotions we experiecne at the time also affect the way we recall the event later. We recall mixed emotions (those with positive and negative components) different than **unipolar emotions** (those that are either wholly positive or wholly negative). **The latter become even more polarized over time, so that we recall good things as even better than they were and bad things as even worse.**
* PICTORIAL VERSUS VERBAL CUES    Is a picture worth a thousand words? There is some evidence for the superiority of visual memory over verbal memory, but this advantage is unclear because it is more difficult to measure recall of pictures. However, the available data indicate that information presented in picture form is more likely to be recognized later. Certainly visual aspects of an ad are more likely to grab a consumer's attention. In fact, eye-movement studies indicate that about 90 percent of viewers look at the dominant picture in an ad before they bother to view the copy.
* **Although pictorial ads may enhance recall, they do not necessarily improve comprehension. One study found that TV news items presented with illustrations (still pictures) at a backdrop result in improved recall for details of the new story, even though undertstanding of the story's content does not improve.**

###### Subheader: FACTORS INFLUENCING FORGETTING
* Marketers obviously hope that consumers will not forget about their products. However, in a poll of more than 13,000 adults, more than half were unable to remember any specific ad they had seen, heard, or read in the last 30 days. **Forgetting is obviously a problem for marketers.**
* Early memory theorists assumed that memories fade because of the simple passage of time. In a process of decay, the structural changes in the brain produced by learning simply go away. Forgetting also occurs because of **interference**; as additional information is learned, it displaces earlier information
* Stimulus-response associations will be forgotten if consumser subsequently learn new responses to the same or similar stimuli in a process known as *retroactive interference**. On the other hand, prior learning can interfere with new learning, a process called *proactive interference*. Since peces of information are stored in memory as nodes that are connected to one another by links; a meaning concept that is connected by a larger number of links is more likely to be retrieved. But, as new responses are learned, a stimulus loses its effectiveness in retrieving the old response.
* These interference effects help to explain problems in remembering brand information. Consumers tend to organize attribute information by brand. Additional attribute information regarding a brand or similar brands may limit a person's ability to recall old brand information. Recall may also be inhibited if the brand name comprises frequently used words. These words cue competing associations and result in less retention of brand information.
* In one study, brand evaluations deteriorated more rapidly when ads for the brand appeared with messages for other brands in the same category than when the ad was shown with ads for 12 dissimilar products. By increasing the salience of a brand, marketers can impair the recall of other brands. However, calling a competitor by name can result in poorer recall for one's own brand.

### Header: Products as Memory Markers
* **Products and ads can themselves serve as powerful retrieval cues. Indeed, the three types of possessions most valued by consumers are furniture, visual art, and photos.** The most common explanation for this attachment is the ability of these things to call forth memories of the past. Studies find that valued possessions can evoke thoughts about people and prior events on several dimensions, including friends and loved ones, sensory experiences, and memories of breaking away from parents or former partners. In fact, researchers are just beginning to probe the effects of autobiographical memories on buying behaviour. These memories appear to be on way that advertisements create emotional responses. **Ads that succeed in getting us to think about our own past also appear to get us to like these ads more**--especially if the link between the nostalgia experience and the brand is strong. Products are particularly important as life-markers when our sense of past is threathened, as when a consumer's current identity is challenged because of some change in role caused by divorce, moving, graduation, and so on. Our possessions often have mnemonic qualities that serve as a for mof external memory by prompting consumers to retrieve episodic memories. For example, family photography allows consumers to create their own retrieval cues, with the 11 billion amateur photos taken annually forming a kind of external memory bank for our culture.

###### Subheader: THE MARKETING POWER OF NOSTALGIA
* **Nostalgia** has been described as a bittersweet emotion, in which the past is viewed with both sadness and longing. References to "the good old days" are increasingly common as advertisers call up memories fo distant youth--feeling they hope will translate to what they're selling today. A stimulus can sometimes evoke a weaken response must later, an effect known as spontaneous recovery. The reestablished connection may explain consumers' powerful nostalgic reactions to songs, pictures, or brands they have not been exposed to in many years.
* Why are nostalgia appeals so welcomed by consumers? According to one consumer analyst, "We are creating a new culture, and we don't know what's going to happen. So we need some warn fuzzies from our past." Or this strategy may work because more than half of adults think things were better in the past than they are today, according to research by Roper Starch Worldwide.
* A **retro brand** is an updated version of a brand from a prior historical period. These products trigger nostalgia, and researchers find that they often inspire consumers to think back to an era where (at least in our memories) life was more stable, simple, or even utopian; they let us "look back through rose-coloured glasses". Recent research suggests that consumer preferences for nostalgic brands are related to a need to belong and that consumption of nostalgic products can resolve belongingness needs.
* Food can do the same thing. One study looked at how favourite recipes stimulate memories of the past. When the researchers asked informants to list three of their favoriate recipes and to talk about these choices, they found that people tended to link them with memories fo past events such as childhood memories, family holidays, milestone event (such as dishes they make only on special holidays such as corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day), heirlooms (recipes handed down through generation), and the passing of time (e.g., eating blueberry cobbler only in the summer).

###### Subheader: MEMORY AND AESTHETIC PREFERENCES
* We like ads and products that remind us of our past: prior experiences also determine what we like now. The nostalgia index indicates that people's tastes in such products as movies and clothing are influenced by what was popular during certain critical periods of their youth. For example, liking a specific song appears to be related to how old a person was when that song was popular. On average, songs that were popular when an individual was 23.5 years old are the most likely to be favoured; favorite movie stars and fashion models are usually those who were popular when that individual was 26 and 33 years old, respectively; and men, but not women, also show evidence of nostalgic attachment to cars from their youth.

### Header: Measuring Memory for Marketing Stimuli
* Because advertisers pay so much money to place their messages in front of consumers, they are natually concerned about whether people will actually remember these messages at a later point in time. It seems that they have good reason to be concerne. In one study, fewer than 40 percent of TV viewers made positive links between commercial messages and the corresponding products, only 65 percent noticed the brand name in a commercial, and only 38 percent recognized a connection to an important point. Even more sadly, only 7 percent of TV viewers can recall the product or company featured in the most recent TV commercial they watched.
* Ironically, we may be more likely to remember companies that we don't like--perhaps because of the strong negative emotions they evoke. In a 2007 survey, for example, that assessed both recall of companies and their reputations, four of the ten best-remembered companies also ranked in the bottom ten of reputation rankings: Halliburton, Ford, General Motors, and ExxonMobil. In fact, Halliburton, with the lowest reputation score, scored the highest media recall of all 60 companies in the survey.

###### Subheader: RECOGNITION VERSUS RECALL
* One indicator of good advertising is, of course, the impression it makes on consumers. But how can this impact be defined and measured. Two basic measures of impact are recognition and recall. **In the typical recognition test, subjects are shown ads one at a time and asked whether they have seen them before. In contrast, free-recall tests ask consumers to think independently of what they have seen, without being prompted for this information first**; obviously, this task requires greater effort on the part of respondent. For example, InterMedia Advertising Group is a research firm that measures advertising effectiveness by monitoring the ability of the TV-viewing population to remember an ad within 24 hours. The firm assigns a recall index to each ad to indicate the strength of its impact. Socres of 2002 attest to the power of a memorable character in aiding recall. Ads with well-known celebrities such as Britney Spears tend to have very high recall rates.
* Under some conditions these two memory measures tend to yield the same results, especially when the researchers try to keep the viewers' interest in the ad constant. Generally, though, recognition scores tend to be more reliable and do not decay over time the way recall scores do. Recognition scores are almost always better than recall scores, **because recognition is a simpler process and more retrieval cues and available to the consumer.**
* Both types of retrieval play important roles in purchase decisions. Recall tends to be more important in situations in which consumers do not have product data at their disposal, and so they must rely on memory to generate the information. On the other hand, recognition is more likely to be an important factor in a store where consumers are confronted with thousand of product options and information (i.e., where external memory is abundantly available) and where the task may simply be to recognize a familiar package. Unfortunately, package recognition and familiarity can have a negative consequence in that warning labels may be ignored, since their existence is taken for granted and not really noticed.

###### Subheader: PROBLEM WITH MEMORY MEASURES
* Although the measurement of an ad's memorability is important, the ability of existing measures to accurately assess these diemensions has been critized for several reasons.
* RESPONSE BIASES    Results obtained from a measuring instrument are not necessarily caused by what is being measured, but rather to something else about the instrument or the respondent. This form of contamination is called a **response bias**. For example, people tend to give "yes" responses to questions, regardless of what is asked. In addition, consumers are often eager to be "good subjects" by pleasuing the experimenter. They will try to give the responses they think the experimenter is looking for. In some studies, the claimed recognition of bugus ads (ad that have not been seen before) is almost as high as the recognition rate of real ads.
* MEMORY LAPSES    People are also prone to unintentially forgetting information. Typically problems include omitting (the leaving out of facts), averaging (the tendency to "normalize" things and not report extreme cases), and telescoping (the inaccurate recall of time). These distortions call into question the accuracy of various product usage databases that rely on consuemrs to recall their purchases and consumption of food and household items. In one study, for example, people were asked to describe what portion of variokus food--small, medium, or large--they ate in a normal meal. However, different definitions of medium were used (e.g., 3/4 cups versus 1-1/2 cups). Regarless of the measurement specified, about the same number of people claimed they normally ate medium portions.
* MEMORY FOR FACT VERSUS FEELINGS     Although techniques are being developed to increase the accuracy of memory scores, these improvements do not address the more fundamental issue of whether recall is necessary for advertising to have an effect. In particular, some critics argue taht these measure do not adequately tap the impact of "feeling" ads, **where the objective is to arouse strong emotions rather than to convey concrete product benefits. Many ad campaigns, including those for Hallmark, Tim Hortons, and Bell use this approach. An effective strategy relies on a long-term buildup of feeling rather than on a one-shot attempt to convince consumers to buy the product**
* Also, it is not clear that recall translates into preference. We may recall the benefits touted in an ad but not believe them. On the ad may be memorable because it is obnoxious, and the product beomces one we "love to hate" . The bottom line is that while recall is important, especially for creating brand awareness, it is not necessarily sufficient to alter consumer preferences. To accomplish this, marketers need more sophisticated attitude-change strategies. These issues will be discussed in Chapter 7 and 8 (Attitude, and attidude change)

## Discuss
1. In his 2005 book Blink: The power of Thinking without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell argues that hallowed marketing research techniques such as focus groups are ineffective. According to Gladwell, we usually react to products quickyly and without much conscious though, so it is better to simply solicit consumers' first impressions rather than getting them to think at length about why they buy. What's your position of t his issue?
2. Some diehard fans were not pleased when the Rolling Stones sold the tune "Start Me Up" for about $4 million to Microsoft, which wanted the classic song to promote its Windows 95 launch. The Beach Boys sold "Good Vibrations" to Cadbury Schweppes for its Sunkist soft drink, and Bob Dylan sold "The Times They Are A-Changin" to Coopers & Lybrand (now pwc). Other rock legends have refused to play the commercial game, including Bruce Springsteen, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, R.E.M., and U2. According to u2's manager, "Rock 'n roll is the last vestige of independence. It is undignified to put that creative effort and hard work to the disposal of a soft drink or beer or car". Singer Neil Young is especially adamant about not selling out; in his song "This Note's for You", he croons, "Ain't singing for Pepsi, ain't singing for Coke, I don't sing for nobody, make me look like a joke". What's your take on this issue? How do you react when one of your favourite songs turns up in a commercial? is this use of nostalgia an effective way to market a product? Why or why not?

## Experiential Exercises
3. Devise a "product jingle memory test". Compile a list of brands that are or have been associated with memorable jingles, such as Oscar Meyer, Sleep Country, or Alka-Seltzer. Read this list to friends and see how many jingles are remembered. You may be surprised at the level of recall.
4. Identify some important characteristics of a product with a well-known brand name. On the basis of these attributes, generate a list of possible brand extension or licensing opportunities. Including some that would most likely not be accepted by consumers.
5. A physician borrowed a page from product marketers when she asked for their advice to help persuade people in the developing world to wash their hands habitually with soap. Diseases and disorders caused by dirty hands--such as diarrhea--kill a child somewhere in the world about every 15 seconds, and about half of those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap. The project adapted techniques that major marketers use to encourage habitual product usage of items such as skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, toothpaste, and vitamins. For example, beer commercials often depict a group of guys together because reserach shows that being with a group of friends tends to trigger habitual drinking! The researchers found that when people in Ghana experienced a feeling of disgust it was a cue to wash their hands. However, as in many developing countries, toilets are actually a symbol of cleanliness because they have replaced pit latrines. So an advertising compaign included messages that reminded people of the germs they could still pick up even in modern bathrooms--mothers and children walked out of restrooms with a glowing purple pigment on their hands that contaminated everything they touched. These images in turn triggered the habit of handwashing and the project resulted in a significant increase in the number of people who washed their hands with soap. How can other organizations that work to improve public health, the environment, or other social issues harness our knowledge about consumer learning and habitual behaviour to create or reenergize positive habits?
6. Collect some pictures of "classic" products that have high nostalgic value. Show these pictures to consumers and allow them to free associate. Analyze the types of memories that they evoke and think about how a marketer might employ these associations in a product's promotional strategy.


# Chapter 4: Motivation and Affect

* It is estimated that 7 percent of the general population is vegetarian and that an additional 10 to 20 percent of consumers are interested in vegetarian options in addition to their tradition fare of meat. The same study also indicates that women aged 15 to 25 are the group of people who most frequently eliminate meat from their diets. To reach these veggie-loving consumers, many companies have developed meat-free products and services. For example, every week Vancouver-based Yves Veggie Cuisine (www.yvuesveggie.com) makes 125 tonnes of soy-based meat look-alikes. British Columbia absorbs 30 percent of that; the rest goes to the United States.
* In addition, some major food companies such as Pillsbury are marketing meat-free food like the Green Giant Harvest Burger, and another company, ConAgra Foods, offers a line of meatless meals called "Life Choice". Magazines such as Vegetarian Times (www.vegetariantimes.com) and Veggie Life (www.veggielife.com) as well as organizations such as the Vegetarian Resource Group (www.vrg.org) respond to the growing interest in vegetarianism.
* The foces that drive people to buy and use products are generally straightforward, as when a person chooses what to have for lunch. As hardcore vegetarians demostrate, however, even the consumption of basic food products may be related to wide-ranging beliefs about what is appropriate or desirable. In some cases these emotional responses create deep commitment to the product. Sometimes people are not even fully aware of teh forces that drive them toward some products and away from others. Often these choices are influenced by the person's values--his or her priorities and beliefs about the world.
* To understand motivation is to understand why consumers do what they do. Why do some people choose to bungee-jump off a bridge or go whitewater rafting in the Yukon, while others spend their leisure time playing chess or gardening? We do everything for a reason, whether to quench a thirst, to kill boredom, or to attain deep spiritual experience. **Marketing students are taught from day one that the goal of marketing is to satisfy consumers' needs. However, this insight is useless unless we can discover what those needs are and why they exist**. A classic beer commercial for Bud Dry asks the question, "Why ask why?" In this chapter we'll find out.

### Header: The Motivation Process
* **Motivation** refers to the processes that cause people to behave as they do. **It occurs when a need is aroused that the consumer wishes to satisfy. Once a need has been activated, a state of tension exists that drives the consumer to attempt to reduce or eliminate the need.**
* This need may be utilitarian (a desire to achieve some functional or practical benefit, as when a person requires a pair of durable sneakers), or it may be hedonic (an experiential need involving emotional responses or fantasies, as when someone buys special running shoes for a triathlon). The desire end state is the consumer's goal. **Marketers try to create products and services that will provide the desired benefits and permit the consumer to reduce this tension. For example, Blackberry's "Tools not Toys" campaign attempts to appeal to utilitarian as opposed to hedonic needs.**
* Whether the need is utilitarian or hedonic, **a discrepancy exists between the consumer's present state and some ideal state. This gulf creates a state of tension. The magnitude of this tension determines the urgency the consumer feels to reduce the tension. This degree of arousal is called a drive. A basic need can be satisfied any number of ways, and the specific path a person chooses is influenced by his or her unique set of experiences and by the values instilled by the culture in which the person has been raised.
* These personal and cultural factors combine to create a want, which is one manifestation of a need. For example, hunger is a basic need that must be satisfied by all; the lack of food creates a tension state  that can be reduce by the intake of such products as cheeseburger, Oreo cookies, raw fish, or bean sprouts. The specific route to hunger reduction is culturally determined.
* Once the goal is attained, tension is reduced and the motivation recedes (for the time being). Motivation can be described in terms of its strength, or the pull it exerts on the consumer, and its direction, or the particular way the consumer attempts to reduce motivational tension.

## Bigheader: MOTIVATIONAL STRENGTH
* The degree to which a person is willing to expend energy to reach one goal as opposed to another reflects his or her underlying motivation to attain that goal. Many theories have been advanced to explain why people behave the way they do. Most share the basic idea that people have some finite amount of energy that must be directed toward certain goals. Two basic theoretical categories that account for motivational strength are drive theories and expectancy theories.

### Header: Drive Theory
* Drive theory focuses on biological needs that produce unpleasant states of arousal (such as your stomach grumbling during a morning class). We are motivated to reduce the tension caused by this phsiological arousal. Tension reduction has been proposed as a basic mechanism governing human behaviour.
* In marketing, tension refers to the unpleasant state that exists if a person's consumption needs are not fulfilled. People may be grumpy if they haven't eaten. This state (of hunger, for example) activates goal-oriented behaviour that attempts to reduce or eliminate the unpleasant state and return to a balanced one, call hmeostasis.
* Those behaviours that are successful in reducing the drive by eliminating the underlying need are strengthened and tend to be repeated. (This aspect of the learning process was discussed in Chapter 3). Your motivation to leave class early to grab a snack would be greater if you hadn't eaten in 24 hours than if you have eaten only two hours earlier. If you did sneak out and had indigestion after, say, wolfing down a package of chips, this behaviour would be less likely to be repeated the next time you wanted a snack. A person's degree of motivation, then, depends on the distance between his or her present state and the goal.
* Drive theory, however, runs into difficulties when it tries to explain some facets of human behaviour that run counters to its predictions. People often do things that increase a drive state rather than decrease it. For example, people may delay gratification. If you know you are going out for a lavish dinner, you might decide to forgo a snack earlier in the day even though you are hungry at that time.

### Header: Expectancy Theory
* Most current explanations of motivation focus on cognitive factors rather than only biological ones to understand what drives behaviour. **Expectancy theory** suggests that behaviour is largely pulled by expectations of achieving desirable outcomes--positive incentives--rather than pushed from within. We choose one product over another because we expect this choice to have more positive consequences for us. Under expectancy theory, positive incentives could include things like money or even social status.

## Bigheader: MOTIVATIONAL DIRECTION
* Motives have direction as well as strength. They are goal-oriented in that specific objectives are desired to satisfy a need. Most goals can be reached by a number of routes, and the objective of marketers is to convince consumers that the alternative they offer provides the best chance to attain the goal. For example, a consumer who decides that he needs a pair of jeans to help him reach his goal of being accepted by others or of projecting an appropriate image can choose among Levi's, True Religion, GUESS, 7 for all Mankind, and many other alternatives, each of which promises to deliver certain benefits.

### Header: Needs versus Wants
* The specific way a need is satisfied depends on the individual's unique history and learning experiences and his or her cultural environment. The particular form of consumption used to satisfy a need is termed a want. For example, two classmates may feel their stomachs rumbling during a lunchtime lecture. If neither person has eaten since the night before, the strength of their respective needs (hunger) would be about the same. However, the way each person goes about satisfying this need might be quite different. The first person may be health-conscious individual fantasizes about gulping down a big handful of trail mix, while the second person may be equally aroused by the prospect of greasy cheeseburger and fries.

### Types of Needs
* People are born with a need for certain elements necessary to maintain life, such as food, water, air, and shelter. These are called *biogenic needs*. People have many other needs, however, that are not innate. *psychogenic needs* are acquired in the process of becoming a member of a culture. **These include the need for status, power, affiliation, and so on. Psychogenic needs reflect the priorities of a culture, and their effects on behaviour will vary in different environments.**
* Consumers can also be motivated to satisfy either utilitarian or hedonic needs. **The satisfaction of utilitarian needs implies that consumers will emphasize the objective, tangible attributes of products, such as kilometres per litre of gas in a car; the amount of fat, calories, and protein in a cheeseburger; or the durability of a pair of jeans.** **Hedonic needs ar esubjective and experiential, leading consumers to rely on a product because it meets their needs for excitement, self-confidence, or fantasy, perhaps to escape the mundane or routine aspects of life.** Of course, consumers may be motivated to purchase a product because it provides both types of benefits. For example, a Louis Vuitton handbag may be bought because of the luxurious image it portrays and because it can carry items needed when out and about.

### Header: Motivational Conflicts
* A goal has valence, which means that it can be positive or negative. A positive valued goal is one toward which consumers direct their behaviour; they are motivated to approach the goal and will seek out products that will be instrumental in attaining it. However, not all behaviour is motivated by the desire to approach a goal. As we saw in Chapter 3, sometimes consumers are motivated to avoid a negative outcome. They will structure their purchases or consumption activities to reduce the chances of attaining this end result. **For example, many consumers work hard to avoid rejection, an avoidance goal. They will stay away from products they associate with social disapproval.** Products such as deodorant and mouthwash frequently rely upon consumers' avoidance motivation by depicting the onerous social consequences of underarm odour or bad breath.
* Because a purchase decision may involve more than one source of motivation, consumers often find themselves in situations in which different motives conflict with one another. Since marketers are attempting to satisfy consumers' needs, they can also help by providing possible solutions to these dilemmas. Three general types of conflict can occur: approach-approach, approach, avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance.

###### Subheader: APPROACH-APPROACH CONFLICT
* In an approach-approach conflict, a person must choose between two desirable alternatives. A student might be torn between going home for the holidays or going on a ski trip with friends. Or she might have to choose between two different concerts because she only has enough money to attend one of them.
* The **theory of cognitive dissonance** is based on the premise that people have a need for consistency in their lives and that a state of tension is created when beliefs or behaviours conflict with one another. The conflict that arises when choosing between two alternatives may be resolve through a process of cognitive dissonance reduction in which people are motivated to reduce this inconsistency (or dissonance) and thus eliminate unpleasant tension.
* Post-decision dissonance can arise when the consumer must make a choice between two products, both of which possess good and bad qualities. By choosing one product and not the other, the person gets the bad qualities of the chosen product and loses out on the good qualities of the unchosen one. This loss creates an unpleasant, dissonant state that the person is motivated to reduce. One way this dissonance can be smart ones by finding additional reasons to support the alternatives he chose, or perhaps by "discovering" flaws with the options he did not choose. **Marketers often attempt to reduce approach-approach conflicts by highlighting the superiority of their brand.** Take for example, the long running "Mac versujs PC" campaign: Apple did an excellent job of highlighting the unique positive attributes of their brand, while depicting the downsides of competing product.

###### Subheader: APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT
* Many of the product and services we desire have negative consequences attached to them as well as positive consequences. We may feel guilty or ostentatious when buying a status-laden product such as a mink coat or feel like a glutton when contemplating a bag of potato chips. When we desire a goal but wish to avoid it at the same time, an approach-avoidance conflict exists.
* Some solutions to these conflicts include the proliferation of fake furs, which eliminate guilt about harming animals while still allowing you to make a fashion statement, and the success of diet foods, such as Weight Watchers' brands, which promise good food without the calories. Indeed, the development of hybrid vehicles is one attempt to resolve approach-avoidance conflicts; the consumer can still have a new car, while reducing the negative impact on the environment. **Many marketers try to overcome guilt by convincing consumers that they are deserving of luxuries (such as when the model for L'Oreal cosmetics claims, "Because I'm worth it!")**

###### Subheader: AVOIDANCE-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT
* Sometimes consumers find themselves caught "between a rock and a hard place": They face a choice between two undesirable alternatives. A person may be faced with the option of either throwing more money into an old car or buying a new one. **Marketers frequently address this conflict through messages that stress the unforeseen benefits of choosing one option (emphasizing special credit plans to ease the pain of new-car payments, for example)**

### Header: Classifying Consumer Needs
* Much research has been done on classifying human needs. On the one hand, **some psychologists have tried to define a universal inventory of needs that could be traced systematically to explain virutally all behaviour. On such effort, developed by Henry Murray, delineates a set of psychogenic needs that (sometimes in combination) result in specific behaviour. These needs, shown in Figure 4-2, include such dimensions as autonomy (being independent), defendence (defending the self against criticism), and play (engaging in pleasurable activities).
* Murray's need structure serves as the basis for a number of widely used personality tests, such as the Thematic Appreception Test (TAT) and the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS). In the TAT, test subjects are shown four to six ambiguous pictures and asked to write answers to four directing questions about the pictures. these questions are: 1) What is happening? 2) What has led to this situation? 3) What is being thought? 4) What will happen? The subject is allowed four minutes of writing time to answer these questions for each story. Each answer is then content-analyzed for references to certain needs and scored whenever that need is mentioned.
* The theory behind the test is that people will freely project their own subconscious need onto the ambiguous picture. By getting their responses to the picture, you are really getting at the person's true needs for achievement or affiliation or whatever other needs may dominate. Murray believed that everyone has the same basic set of needs but that individuals differ in how they priorize them.

                Figure 4-2: Types of Needs Defined by Murray
                Biogenic: Food, Water, Air, Sleep, Sex, Shelter, Dominance, Sueriority, Emotional Stablity, Achievement, Compliance, Order
                Psychogenic: Autonomy, Affiliation, Analysis, Dependence, Self-Depreciation, Exhibition, Assistance, Change, Endurance, Aggression, Defendence, Play

###### Subheader: SPECIFIC NEEDS AND BUYING BEHAVIOUR
* Other motivational approaches have focused on specific needs and their ramifications for behaviour. For example, individuals with a high need for achievement strongly value personal accomplishment. They put a premium on products and services that signify success because these consumption items provide feedback about the realization of their goals. These consumers are good prospects for products that provide evidence of their achievements. One study of working women found that those who were high in achievement motivation were more likely to choose clothing they considered businesslike and less likely to be interested in apparel that accentuated their femininity. Some other important needs that are relevant to consumer behaviour include the following:

                * Need for affiliation (to be in the company of other people). This need is relevant to products and services that alleviate loneliness and that are **consumed among groups of people at places such as athletic venues, bars, and shopping malls**
                * Needs for power (to control one's environment). Many products and services, **ranging from "souped-up" muscle cars to hotels, restaurants, and resorts, promise to respond to the customer's every whim, allowing consumers to feel that they have mastery over their surroundings.**
                * need to uniqueness (to assert one's individual identity). This need is satisfied by products that pledge to accentuate a consumer's distinctive qualities. For example, **Cachet Perfume claims to be "as individual as you are".**

###### MASLOW'S HIERACHY OF NEEDS
* One influential approach to motivation was proposed by the psychologist Abraham Maslow. Maslow's approach is a general one originally developed to understand personal growth and the attainment of "peak experiences". Maslow formulated a hierarchy of biogenic and psychogenic needs in which levels of motives are specified. A hierarchical approach implies that the order of development is fixed--that is, a certain level must be attained before the next, higher one is activated. This universal approach to motivation has been adopted by marketers because it (indirectly) specifies certain types of product benefits that people might be looking for, depending on the different stages in their development and/or their environmental conditions.
* These levels are summarized in Figure 4-3. At each level, different priorities exist in terms of the product benefits a consumer is looking for. Ideally, an individual progresses up the hierarchy until his or her dominant motivation is a focus on "ultimate" goals, such as justice and beauty. Unfortunately, this state is difficult to achieve (at least on a regular basis); most of us have to satisfied with occasional glimpses of peak experiences.
* Social needs are met by seeking warm and satisfying human relationships. When the social needs are more or less satisfied, the esteem or ego needs emerge. Inwardly directed ego needs reflect an individual's need for self-acceptance, self-esteem, achievement, and success. Outwardly directed ego needs include the needs for prestige, reputation, status, and recognition fromm others. Most people spend most of their lives trying to fill their ego needs and never move on to the fifth level of self-actualization. This need refers to individual's desire to fulfil their own potential, to become everything they are capable of becoming, so that they are toally and completely satisfied with their lives.

                Figure 4-3: Levels of Needs in Maslow Hierarchy
                Self-Actualization: self-fulfillment, enrichment experiences---Relevant product: hobbies, travel, education---U.S Army: "Be all you can be"
                Edo Needs: Prestige, status, accomplishment---relevant product: Cars, furniture, credit cards, stores, country clubs, liquors---Royal Salute Scotch: "What the rich give the wealthy"
                Belongingness: Love, friendship, acceptance by others---Relevant Product: clothing, grooming products, clubs, drinks---Pepsi: "You are in the Pepsi generation"
                Safety: Security, shelter, protection---insurance, alarm systems, retirement, investments---Allstate insurance: "You're in good hands with Allstate"
                Physiological: Water, sleep, food---medicines, staple items, generics---Quaker Oat Bran: "It's the right thing to do"

* In summary, Maslow's need hierarchy predicts that higher-order needs becomme the driving force behind human behaviour as the consumer's low-level needs are satisfied. The theory says, in effect, that satisfaction does not motivate behaviour; dissatisfaction does. it is important to note that lower needs are never totally satisfied by are ongoing. We do not need to satisfy one need totally before the next level of need motivates our behaviour. Sometimes certain behaviour satisfy two needs at once. For example, a Mercedes might satisfy the safety need and the ego need for prestige.
* Although Maslow's theory is interesting an applicable to marketing, it has not gone without criticism. There is no measurement tool for researchers to test the need hierarchy empirically. Also, they can not measure precisely how well satisfied one need is before the next-higher-need becommes operational. Another problem with taking Maslow' hierarchy too literally is that its assumption may be particular to Western culture. People of other cultures may question the order of the levels as specified. Many Asian cultures operate on the premise that the welfare of the group (belongingness needs) is more highly valued than needs of the individual (esteem needs).
* The point is that this hierarchy is widely applied in marketing because it reminds us that consumers may have different need priorities at different times and stages of their lives--not because it exactly specifies a consumer's progression up the ladder of needs.

### Header: Motivation and Goal Fulfillment
* People often set goals that are related to consumption. Many consumers set goals to lose weight, to consume less energy, or to exercise more often. Consumers are more likely to achieve such goals when they set goals that are SMART (e.g., Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound). The goal needs to be Specific in that is easier to achieve a clearly specified goal than a more general one. The goal needs to be Measurable, which means there need to be concrete criteria by which goal attainment can be assessed. The goal needs to be somewhat challenging, but also Attainable, meaning realistic. The goal also should be Relevant, something important to the goal setter. And finally, the goal needs to be Time-bound, which refers to the notion that the goal should have a targeted time point for completion.
* In a unique marketing collaboration, Nike and Apple partnered to create a Nike + iPod Sports Kit, which allows the user to measure and record the distance and pace of a run or a walk. Consumers can then use Nike+, which provides an online platform for consumers to directly tract their goal progress and set specific goals such as "Run Farther", "Burn Calories", and "Run Faster". The social aspect of the online platform can also prove very motivating for consumers by allowing them to challenge others, provide feedback, and get encouragement as they set new goals. Importantly, this innovation has helped consumers to set and track goals in ways that are very specific and measurable.
* What happends when consumers get closer to attaining a particular goal? Intuition might suggest that they might work harder as the end goal gets within reach. However, consumers who subjectively feel like they are closer to attaining a goal such as weight loss are ironically then more likely to change course and pursue an alternative goal such as enjoyment. Interestingly, this may lead to actions that are incongruent with the original goal. In one study, consumers who felt they were closer to attaining their weight loss goal were subsequently more likely to choose a chocolate bar over an apple@ Goal progress does not have to be real, and can simply be perceived to have strong effects on behaviour. For example, the mere presence of a healthy option on a fast-food menu can fulfil nutrition-related goals, and in turn, provide consuemrs with "license" to indulge. That is, simply having a healthy option like a salad or apple slices on the menu can lead consumers to end up choose a less than healthy option for their meal.
* One question that has puzzled consumer researchers is whether the motivation to attain goals is always conscious, or if sometimes this can occur below the threshold of awareness. The evidence seems to suggest that sommetimes the motive to attain a goal can be activated in consumption contexts without the consumer even being aware of it. For example, exposing consumers to the "Apple" brand name nehances motivations to be different and unique as compared to exposure to the "IBM" brand name; while exposure to the Disney brand name resulted in consumers being more honest than exposure to the E! brand name. These were incidental effects of brand exposure that consumers were not aware of.

## Bigheader: CONSUMER INVOLVEMENT
* A consumer's motivation to attain a goal influences his or her desire to expend the effort necessary to attain the products or services believed to be instrumental in satisfying that objective. However, not everyone is motivated to the same extent; that is, one person might be convinced that he or she can't live without the latest style or modern convenience, while another is only marginally interested in these items. **Involvement** can be defined as "a person's perceived relevance of the object based on their inherent needs, values, and interests. The word "object" is used in the generic sense and refers to a product (or brand), an advertisement, or a purchase situation. Consumers can find involvement in all these "object".
* Since involvement is a motivational construct, it can be triggered by one or more of the different antecedent shown in Figure 4-4. The antecedents can be something about the person, something about the object, or something about the situation. On the right side of Figure 4-4 are the results of consequence of being involved with the "object". When consumers are intent on doing what they can to satisfy a need, they will be motivated to pay attention to and process any information felt to be relevant to achieving their goals.
* Involvement can be viewed as the motivation to process information. To the degree that there is a perceived link between a consumer's needs, goals, and values and product knowledge, the consumer will be motivated to pay attention to product information. When relevant knowledge is activated in memory, a motivational state is created that drives behaviour (e.g., shopping). As involvement with a product increases, people devote more attention to ads related to the product, exert more cognitive effort to understand these ads, and focus their attention more on the product-related information in them.

### Header: level of Involvement: From Inertia to Passion
* The type of information processing that will occur thus depends upon the consumer's level of involvement. It can range from simple processing, in which only the basic features of a message are considered, all the way to elaboration, in which the incoming information is linked to preexisting knowledge system.
* A person's degree of involvement can be conceived as a continuum, ranging from absolute lack of interest in a marketing stimulus at one end to obsession at the other. Consumption at the low end of involvement is characterized by inertia, where decisions are made out of habit because the consumer lacks  the motivation to consider alternatives. At the high end of involvement we can expect to find the type of passionate intensity reserved for people and objects that carry great meaning to the individual.
* When consumers are truly involved with a product, an ad, or a website, they enter what has been called a **flow state**. This state is the Holy Grail of Web Designers who want to create sites that are so entrancing the consumer loses all track of time as he or she becomes engrossed in the site's contents. Flow is an optimal experience characterized by the following:

                * A sense of playfulness
                * A feeling of being in control
                * Concentration and highly focused attention
                * Mental enjoyment of the activity for its own sake
                * A distorted sense of time
                * A match between the challenge at hand and one's skills

* A more sophisticated view of involvement recognizes that besides the level of involvement there may be a type of involvement. A person may be emotioanlly or affectively involved with an object (such as an advertisement), or rationally or cognitively involved with a product or purchase situation, and so on. The advertising industry has long held this view and advocates different types of advertising strategies depending on the level and type of involvement

### Header: The Many Faces of Involvement
* As previously defined, involvement can take many forms. Involvement can be cognitive, as when a student is motivated to learn all she can about the latest spec of the new iPad release, or emotional, as when the thought of a new Armani suit gives a clothing horse goosehumps. To complicate matters further, advertisements, such as those produced for Nike or Adidas, may themselves be involving for some reason (because they make us laugh or cry or inspire us to work harder). it seems that involvement is a fuzzy concept,  because it overlaps and means different things to different people. Indeed, the consensus is that there are actually three broad types of involvement--that relate to the product, to the message, and to the situation.

###### Subheader: PRODUCT INVOLVEMENT
* Product involvement is related to a consumer's level of interest in a particular product. Many sales promotions are designed to increase this type of involvement. Perhaps the most powerful way to enhance product involvement is to invite consumers to play a role in designing or personalizing what they buy. **Mass customization** is the customization and personalization of products and services for individual customers at a mass production prize. Improved manufacturing techniques in many industries are allowing companies to produce made-to-order products for many customers at a time.
* This strategy applies to a wide range of products and services, from newspaper websites that allow readers to choose which sections of the paper they want to see, to computer you can configure to your specification, to blue jeans you can buy that have a right leg that's one inch shorter than the left leg to fit an asymmetrical body (this is more common than you think). Mars introduced persnoalized M&M's to encourage consumers to bond with its chocolates. At www.mymms.com you can upload a photo and order a batch of M&M's with a face and personal message printed on the candy shell. Nike allows consumers to design their own running shoes on NikeID.com. Lexus sponsored a project with Time Inc. and American Express Publishing (AEP) to produce a customized magazine. Consumers can choose content from a set of magazines such as Time, Sport Illustrated, and Food & Wine, then receive their personalized magazine either in print, online, or via RSS feeds on their cell phone.

###### Subheader: MESSAGE-RESPONSE INVOLVEMENT
* Television is considered a low-involvement medium because it requires a passive viewer who exerts relatively little control over content (remote-control "zapping" notwithstanding). In contrast, print media demand high involvement. The reader is actively involved in processing the information and is able to pause and reflect on what he or she has read before moving on. The role of message characteristics in changing attitudes is discussed further in Chapter 8.
* A variety of marketers are experimenting with novel ways to increase consumers' involvement with different message formats. Procter & Gamble is going so far as to create a new medium by printing trivia questions and answers on its Pringles' snack chips using ink made of blue and red food clouring, while a company called Speaking Roses has patented a technology to laser-print words, images, or logos on flower petals.
* Another tactic is to create spectacles or performances, in which the message is itself a form of entertainment. In the early days of radio and television, ads literally were performances--show hosts integrated marketing messages into the episodes. Today live advertising is making a comeback, as marketers try harder and harder to captivate jaded consumers. For example, the infamous T-mobile "flash mob" in London's busy Liverpool Street station featured a spontaneous-yet-choregraphed dance routine by a massive cast of dancers.
* The quest of heighten message involvement is also fueling the rapid growth of interactive mobile marketing, in which consumers participate in real-time promotional campaigns via their cell phones. One form of this approach is SMS marketing in which retailers and brands offer discount coupons to customers in an effort to engage Mobile users like text messaging, and 95 percent of all texts get opened iwthin five minutes, which is faster than email and social media updates.


###### Subheader: PURCHASER SITUATION INVOLVEMENT
* Purchase situation involvement refers to differences that may occur when buying the same object for different contexts. Here the person may perceive a great deal of social risk or none at all. What people think when they consume the product for themselves, or when they know others will consume the product they buy, is not always obvious or intuitive. For example, when you want to impress someone, you might try to buy a brand or product with a certain image that you think reflect good taste. When you have to buy a gift for someone in an obligatory situation, such as a wedding gift for a cousin you do not really like, you might not care what image the gift portrays, or you might actually pick something cheap that reflects your desire to distance yourself. Again, some smart retailers are waking up to the value of increasing purchase situation involvement by appealing to hedonic shoppers who are looking to be entertained or otherwise engaged in addition to simply "buying stuff". **We'll learn more about how they're doing this via the creation of themed retailing venues and other strategies in Chapter 10.**

### Header: Segmenting by Involvement Levels
* A measurement approach that segments involvement by levels allows consumer researchers to capture the diversity of the involvement construct, and it also allows for involvement to be used as a basis for market segmentation. For example, a yogurt manufacturer might find that even though its product is low in sign value for one group of consumers, it is highly related to the self-concept of another market segment, such as health-food enthusiasts or avid dieters. The commpany could then adapt its strategy to account for the motivation of different segments to process information about the product.
* One study looked at the roles of affective versus cognitive involvement and of level of involvement (high versus low) in promoting Canadian universities. the researchers found that students with a high level of cognitive involvement conducted an intense search for information about universities, while those students who had a low level of cognitive involvement and were affectively involved made their university choice mainly on the basis of emotional factors.

### Header: Strategies to Increase Involvement
* Although consumers differ in their levels of involvement with respect to a product message, marketers do not have to just sit back and hope for the best. By being aware of some basic factors that increase or decrease attention, they can take steps to increase the likelihood that product information will get through. The marketer can enhance the consumer's motivation to process relevant information fairly easily by using one or more of the following techniques:

                * **Appeal to consumers' hedonic needs. For example, ads with sensory appeal generate higher levels of attention**
                * use novel stimuli, such as unusualy cinematography, sudden silences, or unexpected movements in commercials
                * Use prominent stimuli, such as loud music and fast action, to capture attention in commercials. In print formats, larger ads increase attention. Also viewers, look longer at coloured pictures than at those in black and white
                * Include celebrity by maintaining an ongoing relationship with them

* Aside from these guidelines, perhaps the best way to boost consumers' involvement with the marketing messages they see and hear is to let them make the messages. As we've already seen, consumer-generated content in which consumers produce their own commercials for favorite products is now a common marketing tactic. This practice creates a high degree of message-response involvement (also called advertising involvement), which refers to the consumer's interest in processing marketing communications. Doritos has utilized this consumer-centred approach since 2006 with their "Crash the Super Bowl" campaign, in which they hold a contest for the best consumer-generated commercial which is themn aired during the NFL Super Bowl contest. Every year they have refreshed the approach; for example, for the 2012 Super Bowl they announced that the winning entry would work with band The Lonely Island (of Saturday Night Live fame) in producing the commercial to air.

## Bigheader: AFFECT

### Header: Types of Affective Responses
* **Affect** refers to the experience of emotionally-laden states, which can range from evaluations, to moods, to full-blown emotions. Evaluations involved valenced (i.e., positive or negative) reactions to events and objects, that are not accompanied by high levels of arousal. For example, when a consumer evalutes a movie as being positive or negative, this involves some degree of affect accompanied by low levels of arousal. **Moods** involve temporary positive or negative affective states acompanied by moderate levels of arousal. Moods tend to be diffuse and are not necessarily linked to a particular affect-arousing event. **Emotions** (happiness, anger, etc), in contrast to moods, tend to be more intense and are often related to a specific triggering event.
* Marketers use affective states in many ways. First, **positive moods and emotions are often highlighted as a product benefit.** Take for example, **Viagra's marketing campaign that uses humour and music to convey the positive affective quality of the product. Certainly, some product categories such as fragrances, alcohol, tobacco, and caffinated beverages are consumed for their mood-altering qualities. Marketers will also sometimes highlight the avoidance of negative affect as a product attribute, for example, lottery corporations might ask consumers to consider how they would feel if they hadn't played the extra bonus draw.**
* Another way negative moods are sometimes utilized is by activating a negative mood on the part of the consumer (e.g., by showing a picture of starving children in Africa). And then giving the consumer a mean by which t o make him or herself feel better-by donating to the cause. Helping others as a means of resolving one's own negative moods has been referred to as **negative state relief**. One other way consumers can repair negative moods is by purchasing and consuming mood-enhancing products such as chocolate.
* Another way marketers capitalize on affect is through **mood congruency** effects. Mood congruency refers to the notion that our judgments are often consistent with our existing mood states. For example, consumers judge the very same products (cars, TVs, etc) more positively when in a positive as opposed to a negative mood. This is why advertisers may attempt to have ads placed after humorous television programming or endeavour to create uplifting ads. This is also why retailers often employ mood-enhancing stimuli such as pleasing background music, friendly staff, and spatial aesthetics. If the reatiler can create a positive mood on the part of consumers, hopefully consumers will evaluate the merchandise more positively too!
* Mood congruency effects are not inevitable, however. Researchers find that moods are often used as a source of information when evaluating an object. That is, the consumer says to herself, "If I feel happy, I must like this camera I am considering purchasing." But, if the consuemr realizes that her positive mood is due to some other source, such as the upbeat music playing in the background, and not to the camera itself, mood is less likely to bias her judgments. Moods are most likely to be influential when they are considered relevant to t he particular purchasing decision.

### Header: How Social Media Taps into Our Emotions
* Social media platforms also can play on affect. We may share particularly good or bad feelings on Facebook or Twitter, or even resort to emoticons such as :) in texts or emails to convey how we feel. To push sales of its Jell-O brand, Kraft recently unveiled a "Mood Monitor" on Twitter, by which it will randomly send coupons to users it finds who type in a :| emotion. Kraft will monitor the Twittersphere and luanch coupons whenever the national average of smiley faces dips below 51 percent.
* In fact, it's so common for people to express their moods and also their emotional reactions to products that these posts can be a treasure trove for marketers who want to learn more about how their offerings make people feel. **Sentiment analysis** (someimtes called opinion mining) is a process that scours the social media universe to collect and analyze the words people use whne they describe a specific product or company. When people feel a particular way, they are likely to choose certain words that tend to relate to the emotion. From these words, the researcher will create a **word-phrase dictionary** (sometimes called a library) to code the data. A computer program will then scan social media text to identify whether the words in the dictionary appear.
* Consider this example. A review on Epinions, a product review site, included this statement, "The Canon PowerShot A540 had a good aperture and excellent resolution." A sentiment analysis would extract the entities of interest from the sentence, identifying the product as the Canon PowerShot A540 and the relevant dimensions as aperture and resolution. The sentiment would then be extracted for each dimension; the sentiment for aperture is good while that for resolution is excellent. Text mining software would collect these reactions and combine them with others to paint a picture of how people are talking about the product. There are several sentiment analysis programs that do similar things; a new one called ToneCheck even reports on the emotions it detects in people's emails.

### Header: Discrete Emotions
* In recent years, consumer researchers have begun investigating the importance of specific emotion in the consumption environment. While the general notion of positive and negative emotion does have importance in understanding consumer behaviour, the examination of specific emotional reactions during consumption episodes can provide additional insight. For example, envy and embarassment are both negative emotions, but consumers who experience these emotions while out on a shopping trip are likely to have very different reactions to the shopping event.

###### Subheader: HAPPINESS
* Happiness is a mental state of well-being characterized by positive emotions. Researchers have understandably long been interested in what it is that truly makes people happy. Material goods, it seems, are not the secret to happiness. The higher people score on materialism scales, the less happy they seem to be. In one study respondents were asked to think of either a material purchase (defined as a purchase made with the primary intention of acquiring a material possession) or an experiential purchase (defined as a purchase made with the primary intention of acquiring a life experience), which were matched for price. The authors found that experiential purchases brought respondents more happiness than did material purchases. This is because experiential purchases are more open to positive reinterpretations, are a more meaningful part of one's identity, and contribute more to successful social relationships.
* Other research also finds that how we spend our money can influence happiness. For example, people report increased levels of happiness when they spend money on others, as opposed to on themselves. Finally, one possibility is that the key to happiness does not involve money at all; it involves time. Cassie Mogilner, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, suggests that thinking about time, rather than money, influences how effectively people pursue personal happiness goals. This is because encouraging people to think about time motivates them to spend more time with family and friends, and less time working. Thinking about money, on the other hand, induces people to socialize less and work more. It turns out that the secret to happiness might be fostering social connections with the people who are important to us!
* What makes us happy can also vary throughout the lifespan. That is, the meaning of happiness is not fixed and it can shift as people get older. Whereas younger people are more likely to associate happiness with excitement, older people are more likely to associate happiness with feelings of calm and peacefulness. It has been suggested that this is due to increased feeling of connectedness to others and to the present moment as one ages.

###### Subheader: ENVY
* Envy is a negative emotion associated with the desire to reduce the gap between oneself and someone who is superior on some dimension. At the phrase "keeping up with the Joneses" suggests, consumers often experience envy. It has been suggested that two distinct types can emerge. Benign envy occurs when the individual believes that the superior other deserves his or her status. Researchers find that when consumers experience benign envy over a product (e.g., an iPhone) they are willing to pay more for it. Malicious envy occurs when the consumer believes that the superior other does not deserve his or her status. In this case, consumers do not desire the focal product (iPhone), but instead willing to pay more for a different product in the same category (a Samsung phone). Feeling of malicious envy have also been shown to produce negative attitudes and actions toward the envied other. In these instances, envy can result in negative word of mouth, and even acts of sabotage..

###### Subheader: GUILT
* Guilt is defined as "an individual's unpleasant emotional state associated with possible objections to his or her actions, inaction, circumstances, or intentions. **Guilt is often activated in contexts where marketers want consumers to engage in prosocial behaviours, suchas charitable giving.** Marketing communications that activate a sense of guilt on the part of the consumer, or "guilt appeals", can be particularly compelling when other people are present, because the activates a sense of consumer social responsibility. However, extreme guilt appeals can sometimes backfire, and it can be more effective to activate guilt more subtly. For example, the context itself--simply presenting a green, environmentally friendly option alongside a non-green one--can give rise to a sense of anticipatory guilt on the part of the consumer. That is, consumers worry about how guilty they might feel in the future if they were to choose the alternative, non-green option. These authors found that subtler forms of guilt induction were more effective than explicit guilt appeals in encouraging consumers to select green products.
* Consumer guilt can be activated in retail settings too. One field study found that when a consumer fails to make a purchase, this can lead to a guilt response when he or she feels a sense of social connectedness with a salesperson. In such situations, consumers not only feel guilt, but are also likely to engage in reparative actions. For example, they might decide to make their lack of purchase up to the salesperson the next time around.

###### Subheader: EMBARASSMENT
* **Embarrassment is a social emotion driven by a concern for what others are thinking about us. It typically occurs when unwanted events communicate undesired information about oneself to others. To be embarrassed, one must be aware of, and care about, the evaluating social audience, whether real or imagined. Embarrassment in the consumer context most often arises when social sensitive products are purchased. For example, condoms, adult diapers, tampons, hair-lice shampoo, and pornography can be embarrassing products for some consumers. The feeling exists here because the purchase of these items involves exposure of personal information to a social audience. Interestingly, research has shown that familiarity with a product (e.g., previous purchase) can reduce the embarrassment a consumer feels in a shopping environment. Consumers have also been shown to adopt strategies to alleviate embarrassment in such circumstances. For example, they might attempt to hide an embarrassing product among others in the shopping basket, or they choose a cashier who look "more friendly" when paying. Embarrassment can also arise between consumers when a social custom or norm is violated. For example, when one is out on a dinner date, rejection of one's credit card can be a very embarrassing experience

# Chapter 5: The Self

## PERSPECTIVES ON THE SELF
* Many products, from cars to cologne, are bought because people are trying to highlight or downplay some aspect of the self. This chapter focuses on the self. We'll consider how consumers feelings about themselves shape their consumption practices, particularly as they strive to fulfill their society's expectations about how males and females should look and act.

### Does the Self Exist?
Social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook enable everyone to focus on him- or herself and share mundane or scintillating details about their lives with anyone who's interested. Although it seems natural to think about each consumer as having a self, this concept is actually a relatively new way of regarding people and their relationships with society. the idea that every human life is unique rather than a part of a group developed only in late medieval times (between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries). The notion that the self is an object to be pampered is even more recent. In addition, the emphasis on the unique nature of the self is much greater in Western societies. many Eastern cultures instead stress the immportance of a collective self, in which the person's identity is derived in large measure from his or her social group.
* Both Eastern and Western cultures see the self as divided into an inner, private self and an outer, public self. But where these conceptions of self differ is in terms of which part is seen as the "real you": Western culture tends to subscribe to an independent interpretation of the self, which emphasizes the inherent separateness of each individual; non-Western cultures, in contrast, tend to focus on an interdependent self, whereby a person's identity is largely defined by the relationships he or she has with others.

## Self-Concept
* The self-concept refers to the beliefs a person holds about his or her own attributes and how he or she evalutes these qualities. Although one's overall self-concept may be positive, there are certainly parts of the self that are evaluated more positively than others.
* The self-concept is a very complex structure. it comprises many attributes, some of which are given greater emphasis in determining overall self-attitude. Attributes of self-concept can be described along such dimensions as their content (e.g., facial attractiveness versus mental aptitude), positively or negativity (e.g., self-esteem), intensity, stablity over time, and accuracy (e.g., the degree to which one's self-assessment corresponds to reality). As will be seen later in this chapter, consumers' self-assessment can be quite distorted, especially with regard to their physical appearance.
* While the self-concept can be somewhat stable over time and situations, situational factors can influence how we feel about ourselves. For example, television commmercials can elicit unfavourable sterotypes about women, which can actually lead females to experience sterotype threat. Sterotype threat refers to the anxiety the consumer feel when they fear they might act in a way that confirms the group sterotype--for example, the sterotype that women are not as good as men at math. Sterotype threat actually leads women to perform worse on math-related tests and make them less inclined to pursue careers that have a strong math component. Such threats can occur in retail contexts too. When a female needs to take her car to a mechanic she may feel a sense of sterotype threat that leads to decreased purchase intensions when the service provider is male.

###### Subheader: SELF-ESTEEM
* Self-esteem refers to the positivity of your attitude toward yourself. People with low self-esteem do not expect to perform very well, and they will try to avoid embarrassment, failure, or rejection. In contrast, people with high self-esteem expect to be successful, will take more risks, and are more willing to be the centre of attention. Self-esteem is often related to acceptance by others. As you probably remember from your own experience , high school students who hang out in high-status "crowds" seem to have higher self-esteem than their classmates.
* marketing commmunications can influence a consumer's level of self-esteem. Exposure to ads can trigger a process of social comparison, wherein the person tries to evaluate his or her self by commparing it with other people's selves and those of media images. This form of comparison appears to be a basic human motive, and many marketers have tapped into this need by supplying idealized images of happy, attractive people who just happen to be using their products. One study illustrates this process of social comparison. It showed that female college students do tend to compare their physical appearance to that of models who appear in advertising. Furthermore, the study participants who were exposed to beautiful women in advertisements afterwards expressed lowered satisfaction with their own appearance as compared with other participants who did not view ads with models. Another study demonstrated that young women's perceptions of their body shapes and sizes can be altered after they are exposed to as little as 30 minutes of TV programming. Similar finding have been reported for young men.

###### Subheader: REAL AND IDEAL SELVES
* When a consumer compares some aspect of him- or herself to an ideal, this judgment influences self-esteem. A consumer might ask, "Am I as attractive as I would like to be?" "Do I make as much money as I should?" and so on. The ideal self is a person's conception of how he or she would like to be, while the actual self is our more realistic appraisal of the qualities we do and don't have. We choose some products because we think they are consistent with our actual self, while we buy others to help us reach an ideal standard. We also often engage in a process of impression management where we work hard to "manage" what others think of us; we strategically choose clothing and other products that will present us to others in a good light.
* The ideal self is partly moulded by elements of the consumer's culture, such as heroes or people depicted in advertising, that serve as models of achievement or appearance. Products may be purchased because they are believed to be instrumental in helping the consuemr achieve the goal of emulating these models.  Some products are chosen because they are perceived to be consistent with the consumer's actual self, while others are used to help in reaching the standard set by the ideal self.


### Header: Multiple Selves
* In a way, each consumer is really a number of different people. We have as many selves as we have different social roles. Depending on the situation, we act differently, use different products and services, and even vary in terms of how much we like ourselves. A person may required a different set of products to play a number of desired roles. One may choose to consume beer with close friends but opt for a sophisticated Chardonnay when in business company. Each of us plays many roles, and each role has its own script, props, and costumes.
* The self might be thought of as having different components of role identities, with only some of these being active at any given time. Some identities (husband, boss, or student) are more central to the self than others, but others (stamp collector, dancer, or advocate for the homeless) may be dominant in specific siutations. Strategically, this means a marketer may want to take steps to ensure the approrpriate role identity is active before pitching products needed to play that particular role. One obvious way to do that is to place advertising messages in contexts where people are likely to be well aware of that role identity--for example, by promoting fitness and energy products at a marathon.
* If one of the aspects of the consumer's identity temporarily viewed in a negative light, this can have interesting implications for consumer behaviour. In one study, for example, participants learned negative information about their gender identity or neutral information about their gender identity. Participants who were low in collective self-esteem for gender, who didn't strongly value and identitfy with their gender, were less likely to choose a product linked to their gender (e.g., Cosmopolitan megazine for females versus Us magazine) in response to this gender identity threat. Those who were high in collective self-esteem maintained their preferences for gender-linked products, regardless of whether their gender identity was viewed negatively.

### Header: Virtual Identity
* In the influential cyberpunk novel Snow Crash, author neal Stephenson envisioned a virtual world he called "the Metaverse" as a successor to the Internet. in the Metaverse, everyday people take on glamorous identities in an immersive, three-dimensional digital world. The book's main character delivers pizza in RL (real life), but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince and champion swordfighter. The popular Matrix movie trilogy paints a similar (though more sinister) picture of a world that blurs the lines between physical and digital reality.
* Today these fictional depictions come to life as real-time, interactive virtual worlds that allow people to assume vitual identities in cyberspace. Million of people world-wide belong to the virtual world of Second Life, or play the online game WOW. Add to that the million more who play the Sims Online or who visit other computer-mediated environment such as Webkinz, There, Habbo Hotal, MTV's Virtual Laguna Beach, and more than 150 other virtual worlds, and you're looking at a lot of serious role-playing.
* On these sites people assume visual identities, or avatars, that range from realistic versions of themselves to tricked-out versions with exaggerated physical characteristics, winged dragons, or superheroes. Researchers are investigating how these online selves will influence ocnsumer behaviour and how the identities we choose in CMEs realted to our RL identities. Already we know that when people take on avatar forms, they tend to interact with other avatars much as their real selves interact with other RL people. For example, as in the real world, males in Second Life leave more space between themselves when talking to other males versus females, and they are less likely to maintain eye contact than females are. With new platforms like Microsoft Kinect and Nintendo's Wii that eliminate the need for hand controllers, our online and offline selves will continue to align and meld.

###### Subheader: SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM
* If every person potentially has many social selves, how does each develop, and how do we decide which self to "activate" at any point in time? The sociological tradition of **symbolic interactionism** stresses that relationships with other people play a large part in forming the self. This perspective maintains that people exist in a symbolic environment, and that the meaning attached to any situation or object is determined by the interpretatino of the symbols. As members of society we learn to agree on shared meanings. Thus, we "know" that a red light means stop and that the "golden arches" mean fast food. That's important to understand in consumer behaivour, because it implies that our possessions play a key role as we evalute ourselves and decide "who we are".
* Like other social objects, the meaning of consumers themselves are defined by social consensus. The consumer interprets his or her own identity, and this assessment is continuously evolving as he or she encounters new situations and people. In symbolic interactionist terms, we negotiate these meanings over time. Essentially, the conusmer poses the question, "Who am I in this situation?" The answer to the question, "Who do other people think I am?" We tend to pattern our behavour on the perceived expectations of others in a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. By acting the way we assume others expect us to act, we often wind up confirming these perceptions.

###### Subheader: THE LOOKING-GLASS SELF
* Some clothing stores are testing an interactive mirror that doubles as a high-resolution digital screen. When you choose a garment, the mirror superimposes it on your reflection so that you can see how it would look on your body. A camera relays live images of you modeling your virtual outfit to a webiste where your friends can log on and instant-message (IM) you their opinions; their comments pop up on the side of the mirror for you to read. They can also select virtual items for you to try on that the "magic" mirror will reflect.
* This process of imagining the reaction of others toward us is known as the **looking glass self**. According to this view, a process of *reflexive evaluation* occurs when an individual attempts to define the self, and it operates as a sort of psychological sonar: we take readings of our own identity by "bouncing" signals off others and trying to project the impression they have of us. The looking-glass imgae we receive will differ depdning on whose views we are considering. Like the images in distorted mirrors in a fun house, our appraisal of who we are can vary depending on whose perspective we are taking and how accurately we are able to predict evaluations of us.

### Header: Self-Consciousness
* there are times when people seem to be painfully aware of themselves. If you ever walked into a class in the middle of a lecture and noticed that all eyes were on you, you can understand this feeling of self-consciousness. In contrast, consumers sometimes behave with little self-consciousness. For example, people might do things in a stadium, during a riot, or at a party that they would never do if they were highly conscious of their behaviour.
* Some people seem, in general, to be more sensitive to the image they communicate to others, although we all know people who act as if they're oblivious to the impression they are making! A heightened concern about the nature of one's public "image" also results in more concern about the social appropriateness of products and consumption activities.
* Several measures have been devised to quantify this tendency. Consumers who score high on a scale of public self-consciousness are also more interested in clothing and tend to be heavier users of cosmetics. A similar measure is self-monitoring. High self-monitors are more attuned to how they present themselves in their social environments, and their product choices are influenced by their estimates of how these items will be perceived by others. Self-monitoring is assessed by the extend of a consumer's agreement with such statements as "I guess I put on a show to impress or entertain others" or "I would probably make a good actor".
* High self-monitors are more likely than low self-monitors to evaluate products consumed in public in terms of the impressions they make on others. Similarly, some recent research has looked at aspects of vanity, such as a fixation on physical appearance or the achievement of personal goals.

### Header: Consumption and Self-Concept
* It is easy to see how the consumption of products and services contributes to the definition of the self. For an acotr to play a role convincingly, he or she needs the correct props, stage setting, and so on. Consumers learn that different roles are accompanied by constellations of products and activities that help to define these roles. Some "props" are so important to the roles we play that they can be viewed as a a part of the extended self.


###### Subheader: PRODUCT THAT SHAPE THE SELF: YOU ARE WHAT YOU CONSUME
* Recall that reflected self helps to shape self-concept, which implies that people see themselves as they imagine others see them. Since what others see includes a person's clothing, jewellery, furniture, car, and so on, it stands to reason that these products also help to determine the perceived self. The products a consumer owns place him or her into a social role, which helps to answer the question, "Who am I now?"
* People use an individual's consumption behaviours to help them make judgments about who that person is. In addition to considering a person's clothes, grooming habits, and so on, we make inferences about personality based on a person's choice of leisure activities (squash versus bowling), food preference (vegatarians versus "steak and potato" people), cars, home decorating choices, and so on. People who are shown pictures of someone's living room, for example, are able to make surprisingly accurate guesses about that consumer's personality. Just as a consumer's use of products influences others' perceptions, the same products can help to determine his or her own self-concept and social identity.
* A consumer exhibits attachment to an object to the extent that it is used by that person to maintain his or her self-concept. Objects can act as a sort of security blanket by reinforcing our identities, especially in unfamiliar situations. For example, students who decorate their residence rooms with personal items are less likely to drop out of university. This coping process may protect the self from being diluted in a strange environment. When a pair of researchers asked children of various ages to create "Who am I" collages for which they chose pictures that represented their selves, older kids between middle childhood and early adolescence inserted more photos of branded merchandise. And, as they aged, their feelings about these objects evolved from concrete relationship (e.g., I own it) to more sophisticated, abstract relationship (ie, "it is like me")
* Using consumption information to define the self is especially important when an identity is yet to be adequately formed, as occurs when a consumer plays a new or unfamiliar role. **Symbolic self-completion theory** predicts that **people who have an incomplete self-definition tend to complete this identity by acquiring and displaying symobls associated with it. Adolescent boys, for example, might use "macho" products such as  cars and cigarettes to bolster their developing masculinity; these products are a sort of "social crutch" during periods of uncertainty.**
* The contribution of possessions to self-identity is perhaps most apparent when these treasured objects are lost or stolen. One of the first acts performed by instituations that want to repress individuality and encourage group identity, such as in prisons or convents, is to confiscate personal possessions. Victims of burglaries and natural disasters commonly report feeling of alienation, depression, ro being "violated". One consumer's comment after being robbed is typical: "It is the next worst thing to be bereaved: It's like being raped". Burglary victims exhibit a dminished sense of community and fewer feelings of privacy and take less pride in their houses' appearance than do their neighour.
* The dramatic impact of the loss of possessions is highlighted by studying post-disaster conditions in which consumers may literally have lost almost everything but the clothes on their backs during a fire, an ice storm, a flood, or an earthquake. Some people are reluctant to undergo the process of recreating their identities by acquiring new possessions. Interviews with disaster victimes reveal that some are reluctant to invest the self in new possessions and so become more detached about what they buy. This comment from a woman in her 50s is representative of this attitude: "I had so much love  tied up in my things. I can't go through that kind of loss again. What I'm buying now won't be as important to me".

### Header: Self/Product Congruence
* Because many consumption activities are related to self-definition, it is not surprising to learn that consumers demonstrate consistency between their values and attitudes and the things they buy. **Self-image congruence models** predict that products will be chosen when their attributes match some aspect of the self. These models assume a process of cognitive matching between these attributes and the consumer's self-image.
* An exploration of the conflicts experienced by Muslim women who choose to wear headscarves illustrates how even a simple piece of cloth reflects a person's aesthetic, political, and moral dimensions. The Turkish women in the study expressed the tension they felt in their ongoing struggle to reconcile ambiguous religious principles that simultaneously call for modesty and beauty. Society sends Muslim women contradictory messages in modern-day Turkey. Although Quran denounces waste, many of the companies that produce religious headscarves introduce new designs each season and, as style and tastes change, women are encouraged to purchase more scarves than necessary. Moreover, the authors point out that a wearer communicates her fashion sense by the fabrics she selects and by the way she drapes and ties her scarf. In addition, veiling hand, women who cover heads by choice feel a sense of empowerment, while on the other hand the notion that Islamic law exhorts women to cover themselves lest they threaten men's self-restraint and honour is a persistent sign that men exert control over women's bodies and restrict their freedom. As a compromise solution, Nike designed a uniform for observant women in Somalia who want to play sports without abandoming the traditional hijab (a robe that wraps around the head and loosely drapes over the entire body). The company streamlined the garment so that volleyball players could move but still keep their bodies covered.
* Although results are mixed, the ideal self appears to be more relevant as a comparison standard for highly expressive social products like perfume. In contrast, the actual self is more relevant for everyday, functional product. These standards are also likely to vary by usage situation. For example, a consumer might want a functional, reliable car for commuting to work every day, but a flashier model with more "zing" when going out on a date in the evening.
* Research tends to support the idea of congruence between product usage and self-image. One of the earliest studies to examine this process found that car owners' ratings of themselves tended to match their perceptions of their cars. Pontiac drivers, for example, saw themselves as more active and flashier than did Volkswagen drivers. Congruity has also been found between consumers and their most-preferred brand of beer, soap, toothpaste, and cigarettes relative to their least-preferred brands, as well as between consumers' self-images and their favourite stores. Some specific attributes that have been found to be useful in describing some of the matches between consumers and products include rugged/delicate, excitable/calm, rational/emotional, and formal/informal.
* Although these findings make intuitive sense, we can not blithely assume that consumers will always buy products whose characteristics match their own. It is not certain that consumers really see aspects of themselves in down-to-earth, functional products that don't have very complex or humanlike images. It is one t hing to consider a brand personality for an expressive, image-oriented product like perfume and quite another to impute human characteristics to a toaster.
* Another problem is the old "chicken and egg" question: Do people buy products because they are seen as similar to the self, or do they assume that these products must be similar because they have bought them? The similarity between a person's self-image and  the images of products purchased does tend to increase with ownership, so this explanation can not be ruled out.

### Header: The Extended Self
* Many of the props and settings consumers use to define their social roles in a sense become a part of their selves. Those external objects that we consider a part of us make up the **extended self**. In some cultures, people literally incorporate objects into the self--that is, they lick new possessions, take the names of conquered enemies (or, in some cases, eat them), or bury the dead with their possessions.
* We don't usually go that far, but many people do cherish possessions as if they were a part of them. Consider shoes. One study found that people commonly view their shoes as magical emblems of self, Cinderella-like vehicles for self-transformation. On the basis of data collected from consumers, the study concluded that women tend to be more attuned to the symbolic implications of shoes than men. A common theme that emerged was that a pair of shoes obtained when younger--whether a first pair of leather shoes,a first pair of high heels, or a first pair of cowboy boots--had a big impact even later in life. These experiences were similar to those that occur in such well-known fairy tales and stories as The Wizard of Oz (Dorothy's red shoes), and Cinderella (her glass slippers)
* In addition to shoes, of course, many material objects, ranging from personal possessions and pets to national monuments or landmarks, help to form a consumer's identity. Just about everyone can name valued possession that has a lot of the self "wrapped up" in it, whether it is a beloved photograph, a trophy, an old shirt, a car, or a cat. Indeed, it is often possible to construct a pretty accurate "biography" of someone just by cataloguing the items on display in his or her bedroom or office.
* In one study on the extended self, people were given a list of items that ranged from electronic equipment, facial tissues, and TV programs to parents, body parts, and favourite clothes. They were asked to rate each in terms of its closeness to the self. Objects were more likely to be considered a part of the extended self if "psychic energy" was invested in them by expending effort to obtain them or because they were personalized and kept for a long time.
* Consumers define themselves by referring to four levels of the extended self. These range from very personal objects to places and things that allow people to feel as if they are rooted in their environments.

                1. Individual level: Consumers include many of their personal possessions in self-definition. These products can include jewellery, cars, clothing, and so on. The saying "you are what you wear" reflects the belief that one's things are a part of who one is.
                2. Family level: This part of the extended self includes a consumer's residence and the furnishings in it. The house can be thought of as a symbolic body for the family and is often a central aspect of identity.
                3. Community level: it is common for consumers to describe themselves in terms of the neighourhood or town from which they come. For farm families or residents with close ties to a community, this sense of belonging is particularly important.
                4. Group level: Our attachments to certain social groups can also be considered a part of self. A consumer may feel that landmarks, monuments, or sports teams are a part of the extended self.

### Header: Gender Roles
* Gender identity is a very important component of a consumer's self-concept. People often conform to their culture's expectations about what those of their gender should do. Of course, these guidelines change over time, and they can differ radically across societies. It's unclear to what extent gender differences are innate versus culturally shaped, but they're certainly evident in many consumption decision!
* Consider the differences market researchers have observed when comparing the food preferences of men and women. Women eat more fruit. Men are more likely to eat meat; as one food writer put it, "Boy food doesn't grow. it's hunted or killed". Men are more likely to eat Frosted flakes or Corn Pops, while women prefer multigraint cereals. **Men are big root-beer drinkers; women account for the bulk of bottled-water sales.** And the genders differ sharply in the quantities of food they eat. When researchers at Hershey's discovered that women eat smaller amounts of candy, the company created a white chocolate confection called Hugs, one of the most successful food introduction of all time. On the other hand, men are more likely to take their food and drink in larger servings.

###### GENDER DIFFERENCES IN SOCIALIZATION
* In many societies males are controlled by **agentic goals**, which stress self-assertion and mastery. Females, on the other hand, are taught to value **communal goals**, such as affiliation and the fostering of harmonious relations.
* Every society creates a set of expectations regarding the behaviours appropriate for men and women and finds ways to communicate these priorities. For example, an activity such as gift shopping is widely regarded as "women's work". This training begins very young even children's stories reinforce gender roles. A recent analysis showed that, although sterotypical depictions have decreased over time, female characters in children's books are still far more likely to take on nurturing roles, such as baking and gift-giving. The adult when prepares the birthday celebration in stories is virtually always the mother; often no adult male is present at all. On the other hand, the male figure in these stories is often cast in the role of a miraculous provider of gifts.
* When Mattel decided to develop a new brand of building toy called Ello to appeal to girls, its designers began by watching the play patterns of five-to-ten-year-old girls. The toy features interconnecting plastic squares, balls, triangles, squiggles, flowers, and sticks in pastel colours with rounded corners that let users snap pieces together to create houses, people, jewellery, and picture frames. As one of the developers observed, "Boys enjoy stacking blocks and working towards a goal, such as finishing a building. Their play is more physically active, and they like to create conflict between characters. Girls don't like repetitive stacking. They prefer to create relationships between characters, building communities and decorative spaces.
* Research indicates that our brains are "wired" to react differently to males and females--which may help to explain why men tend to objectify women. A study that used brain-scanning technology showed photos of women wearing bikinis to a group of heterosexual male college students and tracked which areas of their brains lit up. The activated areas were the same as those that get aroused when males handle tools. In a follow-up study, men tended to associate bikini-clad women with first-person action verbs such as I "push", "handle" and "grab" instead of the third-person forms such as she "pushes", "handles", and "grabs". On the other hand, when they saw photos of fully clothed women they reverted to the third-person forms, which implied they perceived these women as being in control of their own actions. Female participants who responded to both sets of pictures did not display this difference.

###### Subheader: GENDER VERSUS SEXUAL IDENTITY
* Gender-role identity is a state of mind as well as body. A person's biological-gender (i.e., male or female) does not totally determine whether he or she will exhibit **sex-typed traits**, or characteristics sterotypically associated with one gender or the other. A consumer's subjective feelings about his or her sexuality are crucial as well.
* Unlike maleness and femaleness, masculinity and femininity are not biological characteristics. A behaviour considered masculine in one culture might not be viewed as such in another. For example, the norm that males should be "strong" and repress tender feelings, and that male friends avoid touching each other (except in "safe" situations, such as the football field) is not universal. In some Latin and European cultures it is common for men to hug one another. Each society determines what "real" men and women should and should not do.

###### Subheader: SEX-TYPED PRODUCTS
* Many products also are sex-typed. They take on masculine or feminine attributes, and consumers ofte nassociate them with one gender or another. The sex-typing of products is often created or perpetuated by marketers (e.g., Princess telephones, boys' and girls' bicycles, and Huggies colour-coded diapers). FisherGirl is reeling in female fishing enthusiasts with the colour pink, which represents the fighting power of women against breast cancer. The company designed a line of fishing rods and accessories just for women, with lighter reels and a smaller handle than typical rods. The company also donates a portion of sales to the Breast Cancer Foundation.

### Header: Androgyny
* Masculinity and femininity are not opposite ends of the same dimension. Androgyny refers to the possession of both masculine and feminine traits. Researchers make a distinction between gender-typed people, who are sterotypically masculine or feminine, and androgynous people, whose mixture of characteristics allows them to function well in a variety of social situation. And, of course, the "normality" of sex-typed behaviours varies across cultures. For example, while acceptance of homosexuality varies in Asian cultures, it doesn't occur to most Asian to assume that a man with some feminine qualities is gay. A recent survey of Korean consumers found that more than 66 percent of men are 57 percent of women under 40 were living self-described "androgynous" lifestyles--with men having more traditionally female traits, and women having more traditionally male ones, than they might have had years ago. But the respondents didn't link that with sexual orientation. While the Korean nickname males with feminine interests "flower men", they don't consider this to be a derogatory term.
* Differences in gender-role orientation can influence responses to marketing stimuli, at least under some circumstances. For example, research evidence indicates that females are more likely to undergo elaborate processing of message content, so they tend t o be more sensitive to specific pieces of information when forming a judgment, while males are more influenced by overall themes. In addition, women with a relatively strong masculine component in their gender-role identity prefer ad portrayals that include non-traditional women. Some research indicates that gender-typed people are more sensitive to the gender-role depictions of characters in advertising, although women appear to be more sensitive to gender-role relationships than men.
* In one study, participants read two versions of a beer advertisement, one couched in masculine terms and the other in feminine ones. The masculine version contains phrases such as "X beer has the strong aggressive flavour that really asserts itself with good food and good company," while the feminine version made claims such as "Brewed with tender care, X beer is full-bodied beer that goes down smooth and gentle." People who rated themselves as highly masculine or highly feminine preferred the version that was described in masculine or feminine terms. Sex-typed people in general are more concerned with ensuring that their behaviour is consistent with their culture's definition of gender-appropriateness.
* Recently, researchers developed a scale to identify "non-traditional males" (NTMs) who exhibit sterotypical female tendencies. The scale included statements such as these:

        * I enjoy looking though fashion magazines
        * In our family, I take care of the chequebook and pay the bill. (Reverse-scored)
        * i am concern about getting enough calcium in my diet.
        * I am good at fixing mechanical things (Reverse-scored)

* Not too surprisingly, strong differences emerged between men who answered the scale who were along traditional gender-role lines versus those who had a non-traditional orientation. Asked how they would like to be seen by others, NTMs were more likely than TMs to say that they would like to be considered stylish, sophisticated, up to date, and trendsetting. They were also more likely to say that they would like to be seen as sensitive, spiritual, affectionate, organized, and thrifty, but less likely to say they would like tobe seen as "outdoorsy".

###### Subheader: GENDER-BENDING PRODUCTS
* Smart marketers try to think about new markets for their products. Some commpanies that sell exclusively to one gender, therefore, may decide to test the waters with the other sex when they promote **gender-bending products**, a traditionally sex-typed item adapted to the oppositive gender. Here are some recent gender-benders.

* Rubbermaid introduced a line of grooming tools specifically for men, including tweezers and clippers. As a manager explained, "most men don't want to go to what we call the "pink aisle" of the store to get tweezers and clippers that are made for women. They want products that look masculine and are made for their specific grooming needs." The tools fit better in men's hands and are stronger as well to address issues such as thicker toenails and hair that grows in different places. In addition to drug stores, men can buy the products at Home Depot.
* Frito-Lay salty snacks traditionally appeal to men, but the company is working hard to change that with baked versions of chips and 100-calorie packages of snacks. After conducting extensive research (including asking several hundred women to keep detailed journals of their daily activities), the company's marketers concluded that the typical woman looks for a reminder that she's eating something healthy. One result of this wokr is that the bag for Baked!Lay's changed from shiny yellow to a matte beige that displays picutres of the ingredient such as spices or ranch dressing.
* Harley-Davidson backed a Guinness World Record attempt for the number of women motorcycle riders trained in one weekend. Its dealerships host women-only garage parties.
* As fewer men take up the sport of hunting, the industry is going after women--and Sarah Palin (who apparently knows how to shoot and field-dress a moose) probably helped to publicize the sport during the US 2008 presidential election. As one female hunter observed, companies first tries to simply to "pink it and shrink it", but now they're taking more sophisticated steps. They manufacture light crossbows and product TV shows that start women shooters such as American Huntress and Fmaily Tradtions with Harley Heath. Apparel makers including SHE Safari and Foxy Huntress sell women's camouflage clothing.

### Header: Female Roles
* In the 1949 movie Adam's Rib, katharine Hepburn played a stylish and competent lawyer. This was one of the first films to show that a woman can have a successful career and still be happily married. Today the evolution of a new managerial class of women has forced marketers to change their traditional assumptions about women as they target this growing market.
* Younger women's views of themselves are quite different from those of their mothers and grandmothers, who fought the good fight for femininism 40 to 50 years ago. To some extend they may take for granted certain rights that older generations of women had to fight for. After all, they have grown up with female role models who are strong leaders, they participate to a much greater degree in organized sports, and they spend a lot of time on the Internet where factors such as gender, race, and social status tend to disappear.
* Announcing the death of tradtional role sterotypes is premature, however. This is certainly true in traditional Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia, where women are required to be completely covered in public and are not allowed to work as salespeople in stores open to the public (even if the store sell female intimate apparel)
* To futher commplicate matters, sex roles constantly evolve--in a complex society such as ours we often encounter contradictory messages about "appropriate" behaviour and we may find ourselves putting a very different face as we jump from situation to situation. A recent exploration of what the authors of the study labelled **Contemporary Young Mainstream Femal Achiever (CYMFA)** identified different roles these women play in different contexts. For example, as a mother or partner they enact a highly feminine role, as a tough businesswoman they perform a masculine role, and with a friend they might fill both roles at once.
* And, like other fashion phenomena that we'll talk about in Chapter 15 (The creation and diffusion of culture), a wave in one direction may set off a ripple in another. We can clearly see this in the messages girls have been getting from the media for the last several years: It's cool to be slutty. Role models such as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and even Bratz dolls convey standards about how far preteens and teens should go in broadcasting their sexuality. Since these messages seem  to go over the top (at least in the eyes of some concerned parents), we are starting to see early signs of a backlash. At the Pure Fashion website, girls get style tips including skirts and dresses that fall no more than four fingers above the knee and no tank tops without a sweater or jacket over them. Several other sites such as ModestByDesign.com advocate a return to styles that leave almost everything to the imagination. In our culture moving from a celebration of "girl gone wild" to "girls gone mild?" Stay tuned.


### Header: Male Roles
* Although the traditional conception of t he ideal male as a tough, aggressive, muscular man who enjoys "manly" sports and activities is not dea, society's definition of the male role is evolving. Like women, men receive mixed messages about how they are supposed to behave and feel. It's more common these days to see men holding babies or being involved in meaningful relationships with women or with male friends in advertisements.
* In a display of "what's sauce for the goose is sauce for gander", men are concerned as never before with their appearance. Men spend $7.7 billion on grooming products globally each year. Skin cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, depilatories, and body spray are available, largely from European companies, especially for men. 
* L'Oreal Paris reports that men's skincare products are now its fastest-growing sector. In Europe, 24 percent of men younger than age 30 use skincare products--and 80 percent of young Korean men do. Norelco reported a 24 percent rise in facial-hair grooming products in 2008. Mintel also reports big growth, especially in products with anti-aging and exfoliating ingredients. And even some cosmetics products such as fundation and eyeliner are catching on in some segments, though men aren't comfortable owning up to using them. In fact, one British makeup product look like a ballpoint so men can apply it secretly at the office.
* No doubt one of the biggest marketing buzzwords over the past decade is **metrosexual**, a straight urban male who exhibits strong interests and knowledge regarding product categories such as fashion, home design, gourmet cooking, and personal care that run counter to the traditonal male sex role. A gay writer named Mark Simpson actually coined the term in a 1994 article when he "outed" British soccer star

# Chapter 6: Personality, Lifestyles, and Values
* The concept of **personality refers to a person's unique psychological makeup and how it consistently influences the way he or she responds to the environment. Over the years, the nature of the personality construct has been hotly debated. Many studies have found that people tend not to behave consistently across different situations and that they do not seem to exhibit stable personalities. In fact, some researchers feel that people do not exhibit a consistent personality across different situations; they argue that this is merely a convenient way to think about other people.
* This argument is a bit hard to accept intuitively, possibly because we tend to see others in a limited range of situations, and so, to us, most people do act consistently. On the other hand, each of us knows that we are not all that consistent; we might be wild and crazy sometimes and the model of respectabilities at other times. Although certainly not all psychologists have abandoned the idea of personality, many now recognize that a person's underlying characteristics are but one part of the puzzle and that situational factors often play a large role in determining behaviour. Still, some aspects of personality tend to be relatively stable over time and across a variety of situations. These aspects continue to be accounted for in marketing strategies and are usually employed in concert with a person's choices of leisure activities, political outlook, aesthetic tastes, and other individual factors that make up an individual's lifestyle, a concept we'll focus on more fully in this chapter.
* Many approaches to understanding the complex concept of personality can be trace to psychological theorists who began to develop these perspectives in the early part of the century. These perspectives were qualitative, in the sense that they were largely based on analysts' interpretations of patients' accounts of dreams, traumatic experiences, and encounters with others.

### Header: Consumer Behaviour on the Couch: Freudian Theory
* Sigmund Freud developed the idea that much of human behaviour stems from a fundamental conflict between a person's desire to gratify his or her physical needs and the necessity to function as a responsible member of society. This struggle is carried out in the mind among three symbolic self systems.

###### Subheader: FREUDIAN SYSTEMS
* The **id** is the component of the self entirely oriented toward immediate gratification--it is the "party animal" of the mind. It operates according to the pleasure principle: Behaviour is guided by the primary desire to maximize pleasure and avoid pain. The id is selfish and illogical. It directs a person's psychi energy toward pleasurable acts without regard for any possible consequences.
* The **superego** is the counterweight to the id. This system is essentially the person's conscience. It internalizes society's rules and works to prevent the id from seeking selfish gratification.
* Finally, the **ego** is the system that mediates between the id and the superego. It is, in a way, a referee in the fight between temptation and virtue. The ego tries to balance these two opposing forces according to the reality principle. it finds way to gratify the id that the person is not necessarily aware of the underlying reasons for behaviour.
* Some of Freud's ideas have also been adapted by consumer researchers. In particular, his work highlights the potential importance of **unconscious motives** underlying purchases. The implication is that consumers can not necessarily tell us their tru motivations for choosing a product, even if we can devise a sensitive way to ask them directly.
* The Freudian perspective also hints at the possibility that the ego relies on the symbolism in products to compromise between the demands of the id and the prohibitions of the superego. The person channels his or her unacceptable desires into acceptable outlets by using products that signify these underlying desires. This is the connection between product symbolism and motivation: The product stands for, or represents, a consumer's true goal, one that is socially unacceptable or unattainable, by acquiring the product, the person is able to experience vicariously the forbidden fruit.

###### Subheader: SOMETIMES A CIGAR IS JUST A CIGAR
* Most Freudian applications in marketing are related to the ways in which products might channel unconscious urges, such as those involving sexuality and aggression. For example, some analysts have speculated that a sports car is a subtstitute for sexual gratification for many men. Indeed, some men do seem inordinately attached to their cars and may spend many hours lovingly wash and polish them.
* Others focus on male-oriented symbolism--the so-called phallic symbol--that appeals to women. Although Freud himself joked that "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar", many pop applications of Freud's ideas revolve around the use of objects that resemble sex organs (such as cigars, trees, or swords for men, and tunnels for women). This focus stems from Freud's analysis of dreams, which were often interpreted as communicating repressed desires through symbols.

### Header: Motivational Research
* The first attempt to apply Freudian ideas to understanding the deeper meanings of products and advertisements were made in the 1950s, when a perspective known as **motivational research** was developed. This approach is largely based on psychoanalytic (Freudian) interpretations, with a heavy emphasis on unconscious motives. A basic assumption is that socially unacceptable needs are channelled into acceptable outlets.
* Motivational research relies on in-dept interviews with individual consumers. Instead of asking many consumers a few general questions about product usage and combining these responses with those of many other consumers in a representative statistical sample, this technique uses relatively few consumers but probes deeply into each person's purchase motivations. An in-depth interview might take several hours and is based on the assumption that the respondent can not immediately articulate his or her latent, or underlying, motives; these can be derived only after meticulous questioning and interpretation on teh part of a carefully trained interviewer.

## Bigheader: BRAND PERSONALITY
* In 1886 a momentous event occured: The Quaker Oats man first appeared on boxes of hot cereal. Quakers had a reputation in nineteenth-century America for being shrewd but fair, and peddlers sometimes dressed as Quakers for this reason. The cereal commpany's decision to "borrow" this imagery for its packaging signalled the recognition that purchasers might make the same associations with their product. A **brand personality** is the set of traits people attribute to a product as if it were a person. Many of the most recognizable figures in popular culture are spokescharacters for long-standing brands, such as the Tony the Tiger, Geico Gecko, and the Jolly Green Giant. And, like real people, these characters sometimes need a "makeover" to keep them fresh and young-looking . The venerable Mr. Penut recently got one: After decades of being depicted as dignified dandy with his monocle and cane (he's based on a 1916 drawing by a Virginia schoolboy), Planters now allows Mr. Peanut to show off his moves on the basketball court and the dance floor, and in one spot he even poses as a centrefold.
* Our feelings about a brand's personality are an important part of **brand equity**, which refers to the extent to which consumers hold strong, favourable, and unique associations with a brand in memory--and the extent to which they are willing to pay more for the branded version of a product than for a non-branded (generic) version.
* Name recognition has become so valuable that some companies are commpletely outsourcing production to focus on nurturing the brand. Nike doesn't own any sneaker factories, and Sara Lee sold off many of its bakeries, meat-processing plants, and texile mills to become a "virtual" corporation. Sara Lee's CEO commented, "Slaughtering hogs and running knitting machines are businesses of yesterday".
* So how do people think about brands. Advertisers are keenly interested in this question, and several conduct extensive consumer research to help them understand how consumers connect to a brand before they roll out campaigns. For example, DDB Worldwide carries out a global study called "Brand Capital" of 14,000 consumers for this purpose. Leo Burnett's "Brand Stock" project involves 28,000 interviews. WPP Group has "BrandZ", the Young & Rubicam has its BrandAsset Valuabtor. DDB's worldwide brand planning director observes.

# Section 3: Attitude Change and Decision Making

# Chapter 7: Attitudes

## THE POWER OF ATTITUDES
* The term attitude is widely used in popular culture. You might be asked, "What is your attitude toward abortion?" A parent might scold, "Young man, I don't like your attitude". Some bars even euphemistically refer to happy hour as "an attitude adjustment period."
* For our purposes, an **attitude** is a tasting, general evaluation of people (including oneself), objects, or issues. Anything toward which a person has an attitude, whether tangible, such as a brand of vodka, or intangible, such as drunk driving, is called an attitude object (Ao). An attitude is lasting because it tends to endure over time. It is general because it applies to more than a momentary event, like hearing a loud noise (though you might, over time, develop a negative attitude toward all loud noises). Consumers have attitudes toward very product-specific behaviour (such as using Crest toothpaste rather than Colgate), as well as toward more general consumption-related behaviours (such as how often they should brush their teeth). Attitudes help to determine whom a person chooses to date, what music he or she listen to, whether he or she will recycle or discard aluminum cans, and whether he or she chooses to beome a consumer researcher for a living.
* This chapter will consider the contents of an attitude, how attitudes are formed, and how they can be measured, and will review some of the surprisingly complex relationships between attitudes and behaviour. In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at how attitudes can be changed--certainly an issue of prime importance to marketers.

### Header: The Function of Attitudes
* The **functional theory of attitudes** are initially developed by psychologist Daniel Katz to explain how attitude facilitate social behaviour. According to this pragmatic approach, attitudes exist because they serve some function for the person; that is, they are determined by a person's motives. Consumers who expect that they will need to deal with similar informaion at a future time will be more likely to start forming attitudes in anticipation of this event.
* Two people can each have the same attitude toward some object for very different reasons. As a result, it can be helpful for a marketer to know why an attitude is held before attempting to change it. The following are attitude functions identified by Katz:

                * Utilitarian function: The utilitarian function is related to the basic principles of reward and punishment. We develop some of our attitudes toward product simply on the basis of whether these products provide pleasure or pain. If a person likes the taste of a cheeseburger, that person will develop a positive attitude toward cheeseburgers. Ads that stress straightforward product benefit (e.g., you should drink Diet Coke "just for the taste of it") appeal to the utilitarian function.
                * Value-expressive function: Attitudes that perform a value-expressive function epxress the consumer's central values of self-concept. A person forms a product attitude not because of its objective benefits, but because what the product says about him or her as a person ("What sort of man rides a Harley?"). Value-expressive attitudes are highly relevant to lifestyle analyses, in which consumers cultivate a cluster of activities, interests, and opinions to express a particular social identity
                * Ego-defensive function: Attitudes that are formed to protect the person, either from external threats or internal feelings, perform an ego-defensive function. Products that promise to help a man project a rugged, manly image may be appealing to his insecurities about his masculinity.
                * Knowledge function: Some attitudes are formed as the result of a need for order, structure, or meaning. This need is often present when a person is in an ambiguous situation or is confronted with a new product ("Bayer wants you to know about pain relievers)
        
* An attitude can serve more than one function, but in many caess a particular one will be dominant. By identifying the dominant function a product serves for consumers (what benefits it provides), marketers can emphasize these benefits in their communications and packaging. Ads relevant to the function prompt more favourable thoughts about what is being marketed and can result in a heightened preference for both the ad and the product.
* The importance of an attitude object may differ quite a bit for different people. Understanding the attiude's importance to an individual and to others who share similar characteristics can be useful to marketers who are trying to devise strategies that will appeal to different customer segments. A study of football game attendance illustrates that varying levels of commitment result in different fan "profiles". The study identified tthree distinct clusters of fans.

                * One cluster consisted the real diehard fans who were highly committed to their team and who displayed an enduring love of the game. To reach these fans, **the researchers recommend that sports marketers should focus on providing them with greater sports knowledge and relate their attendance to their personal goals and values**
                * A second cluster reflected attitudes based on the unique, self-expressive experience provided by the game. They enjoy stimulation of cheering for a team and the drama of the competition itself. They are more likely to be "brand switchers" who are fair-weather fans, shifting allegiances when the home team no longer provides the thrills they need. This segment can be appealed to by publicizing aspects of the visiting teams, such as advertising the appearance of stars likely to give the fans a game they will remember.
                * A third cluster were looking for camarderie above all. These consumers attend games primarily to take part in small group activities such as pre- or postgame parties that accompany the event. Marketers could appeal to this cluster by providing improved peripheral benefits, such as making it easier for groups to meet at the stadium, improving parking, and offering multiple-unit pricing.

### Header: The ABC Model of Attitudes
* When Subaru began work on a new marketing strategy, the automaker discovered that even though most auto buyers had heard of their brand, very few had strong emotional connections to it. however, among Subaru owners there was an outspoken passion and love for the brand, and they expressed a very positive emotional link to their cars. The new campaign therefore targets people who are in three different stages of buying a car--what Subaru calls the heart, the head, and the wallet. Advertisements for the "heart" stage focus on the love owners have for their cars by sharing personal stores of attachment. The "head" stage ads, in contrast, present a rational side of specific models, as  they emphasize how the cars benefit  their owners in term of reliability, economy, and so on. The "wallet" ads deal with the financial side of acutally buying a Subaru, such as local dealer offers.
* Like the Subaru campaign, an attitude has three components: affect, behaviour, and cognition. **Affect** refers to the way a consumer feels about an attitude object. **Behaviour**, or conation, involes the person's intentions to do something with regard to an attitude object (but, as will be discussed later, an intention does not always result in an actual behaviour). **Cognition** refers to the beliefs a consumer has about an attitude object. These three components of an attitude can be remembered as t he ABC model of attitudes.
* This model emphasizes the interrelationships among knowing, feeling, and doing. Consumers' attitudes toward a product can not be determined simply by identifying their beliefs about it. For example, a researcher might find that shoppers "know" a particular camcorder has an 8:1 power zoom lens, auto-focus, and a flying erase head, but such finding do not indicate whether they feel these attributes are good, bad, or irrelevant, or whether they would actually buy the camcorder.

###### Subheader: HIERARCHIES OF EFFECTS
* Althoug all three components of an attitude are important, their relative importance will vary according to a consumer's level of motivation with regard to the attitude object. Attitude researchers have developed the concept of a **hierarchy of effects** to explain the relative impact of the three components. Each hierarchy specifies that a fix sequence of steps occurs en route to an attitude. Three different hierarchies are summarized in Figure 7-1.

###### Subheader: THE HIGH-INVOVEMENT HIERARCHY
* When highly involved, a consumer approaches a product decision as a problem-solving process. First, he or she forms beliefs about a product by accumulating knowledge (beliefs) regarding relevant attributes. Next, the consumer evalutes these beliefs and forms a feeling about the product (affect). Finally, on the basis of this evaluation, the consumer engages in a relevant behaviour, such as buying the product.
* The careful choice process often results in a type of brand loyalty. The consumer "bonds" with the product over t ime and is not easily persuaded to experiment with other brands. The standard learning hierarchy assumes that a consumer is highly involved in making a purchase decision. The person is motivated t o seek out a lot of informaiton, carefully weigh alternatives, and come to a thoughtful decision.

###### Subheader: THE LOW-INVOLVEMENT HIERARCHY
* In sharp contrast to high involvement, under low involvement interest in the attitude object is at best lukewarm. The consumer has collected only a minimal amount of information before acting and has an emotional response only after consuming the product. This is typical of a consumer who forms an attitude via the low-involvement hierarchy of effects. in this sequence, the consumer initially does not have a strong preference for one brand over another; he or she instead acts on teh basis of limited knowledge and then forms an evaluation only after the fact. The attitude is likely to come about through behavioural learning, in which the consumer's choice is reinforced by good or bad experiences with the product after purchase.
* The possibility that consumers simply don't care enough about many decisions to carefully assemble a set of product beliefs and then evaluate them is important, because it implies that all the concern about influencing beliefs and carefully communicating information about product attributes may be largely wasted. Consumers aren't necessarily going to pay attention anyways; they are more likely to respond to simple stimulus-response connections when making purchase decisions. For example, a consumer choosing among paper towels might remember that "Bounty is the quicker picker-upper" rather than bothering systematically to compare all the brands on the shelf.
* The notion of low involvement on the part of consumers is a bitter pill for some marketers to swallow. Who wants to admit that what they market is not very important or involving? A brand manager for, say, a brand of breath mints or cat food may find it hard to believe that consumers don't put that much thought into purchasing the product or spend many of their waking (and perhaps sleeping) hours thinking about it.
* For marketers, the ironic silver lining to this low-involvement cloud is that under these conditions consumers are not motivated to process a lot of complex brand-related information. Instead, they will be swayed by principles of behavioural learning, such as the simple responses caused by conditioned brand name, point-of-purchase displays, and so on. This results in what we might call the involvement paradox: The less important the product to consumers, the more important many of the marketing stimuli (e.g., package, jingles) that have to be devised to market it.

###### ZAJONC'S MODEL OF HEDONIC CONSUMPTION
* Researchers in recent years have begun to stress the significance of emotional response as a central aspect of an attitude. According to the experiential hierarchy of effect, consumers act on the basis of their emotional reactions. This perspective highlights the idea that attitudes can be strongly influence by product attributes irrelevant to the actual product quality, such as package design and colour, and by consumers' reactions toward accompanying stimuli, such as advertising and even the brand name. As discussed in Chapter 2, resulting attitudes will be affected by consumers' hedonic motivations, such as how the product makes them feel or how much fun it will provide.
* Even the emotional expressed by the communicator have an impact. A simile is infectious; in a process term emotional contagion, messages delivered by happy people enhance our attitude toward the product. Numerous studies indicate that the mood a person is in when exposed to a marketing message influences how the ad is processed, the likelihood that the information presented will be rememberd, and how the person will feel about the advertised item and related products in the future.
* One important debate about the experiential hierarchy concerns the dndependence of cognition and affect. On the one hand, the cognitive-affective model argues that an affective judgment is but the last step in a series of cognitive processes. Earlier steps include the sensory registration of stimuli and the retrieval of meaningful information from memory to categorize these stimuli.
* On the other hand, the *independence hypothesis* takes the position that affect and cognition inolve two separate, partially independent systems; affective responses do not always require prior cognitions. The independence hypothesis does not eliminate the role of cognition in experience; it simply balances this traditional, rational emphasis on calculated decision making by paying more attention to the impact of aesthetic, subjective experience. This type of holistic processing is more likely to occur when the product is perceived as primarily expressive or when it deliver sensory pleasure rather than utilitarian benefits.

### Header: Product Attitudes Don't Tell the Whole Story
* marketers who are concerned with understanding consumers' attitudes have to contend with an even more complex issue: In decision-making situations, people form attitudes toward objects other than the product itself that can influence their ultimate selections. One additional factor to consider influence their ultimate selections. One additional factor to consider is *attitudes toward the act of buying* in general. As we'll see later in this chapter, sometimes people are reluctant, embarrassed, or just too plain lazy to expend the effort to obtain a desired product or service.

###### Subheader: ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ADVERTISEMENT
* In addition, consumers' reactions to a product, over and above their feelings about the product itself, are influenced by their evaluations of its advertising. Our evaluation of a product can be determined solely by our appraisal of how it is depicted in marketing communications; that is, we don't hesitate to form attitudes toward products we've never even seen in person, much less used.
* One special type of attitude object, then is the marketing message itself. The **attitude toward advertisement (Aad)** is defined as a predisposition to respond in a favourable or unfavourable manner to a particular advertising stimulus during a particular exposure occasion. **Determinants of Aad include the *viewer's attitude toward the advertiser*, *evaluations of the ad execution itself*, *the mood evoked by the ad*, and *the degree to which the ad affects viewers' arousal levels***. A viewer's feelings about the context in which an ad appears can also influence brand attitudes. For example, attitudes about an ad and the brand depicted will be influenced if the consumer sees the ad while watching a favourite TV program. The effects demonstrated by Aad emphasize the importance of an ad's entertainment value in the purchase process. If consumers are not able to view an ad again, buth belief in and attitude confidence about that ad rapidly diminish. This research supports marketer's efforts to pulse or frequently repeat advertisements in the media.

###### ADS HAVE FEELING TOO
* The feelings generated by advertising have the capacity to directly affect brand attitudes. Commercials can evoke a wide range of emotional responses, from disgust to happiness. These feelings can be influenced both by the way the ad is done (the specific advertising execution) and by the consumer's reactions to the advertiser's motives. For example, many advertisers who are trying to craft messages for adolescents and young adults are encountering problems because this age group, having grown up in a "marketing society", tend to be skeptical about attempts to get them to buy things. These reactions can, in turn, influence memory for advertising content. At least three emotional dimensions have been identified in commercials: pleasure, arousal, and intimidation. Specific types of feelings that can be generated by an ad include the following:

                Upbeat feelings: Amused, delighted, playful
                Warm feelings: affectionate, comtemplative, hopeful
                Negative feelings: Critical, defiant, offended

## Bigheader: FORMING ATTITUDES
* We all have lots of attitudes and we don't usually question how we got them. Certainly a person isn't born with the conviction that, say, Pepsi is better than Coke, or that heavy metal music liberates the soul. Where do these attitudes come from?
* An attitude can form in several different ways, depending on the particular hierarchy of effects in operation. It can occur because of classical conditioning, wherein an attitude object, such as the McDonald's name, is repeatedly paired with a catchy jingle (I'm loving it). Or it can be formed through instrumental conditioning, in which consumption of the attidue object is reinforced (e.g., "Pepsi quenches one's thirst"). Or the learning of an attitude can be the outcome of a very complex cognitive process. For example, a teenager may come to model the behaviour of friends and media figures who drink Red Bull because she believes that this act will allow her to fit in with the desirable images of the millennial generation.

### Header: Not All Attitudes Are Created Equal
* It is important to distinguish among types of attitudes, since not all are formed the same way. For example, on the one hand, a highly brand-loyal consumer has an enduring, deply held positive attitude toward an attitude object, and this involvement wil lbe difficult to weaken. On the other hand, another consumer may be less brand-loyal; he or she may have a mildly positive attitude toward a product but be quite willing to abandon it when something better comes along. This section will consider the differences between strongly and weakly held attitudes, and briefly review some of the major theoretical perspectives that have been developed to explain how attitudes form and relate to one another in the minds of consumers.

### Header: Levels of Commitment to an Attitude
* Consumers vary in their commitment to an attitude. The degree of commitment is related to their level of involvement with the attitude object as follows:

* Commpliance: At the lowest level of involvement, compliance, an attitude is formed because it helps gain rewards or avoid punishments from others. This attitude is very superficial; it is likely to change when the person's behaviour is no longer monitored by others or when another options become available. A person may drink Pepsi because this is the brand that all of his friends drink and he doesn't want to rock the boat.
* Identification: A process of identification occurs when attitudes are formed  so that the consumer will then feel simmilar to another person or group. Advertising that depicts the social consequences of choosing some products over others is relying on the tendency of consumers to imitate the behaviour of desirable models.
* Internalization: At a high level of involvement, deep-seated attitudes are internalizaed and become part of the person's value system. These attitudes are very difficult to change, because they are so important to the individual.

### Header: The Consistency Principle
* Have you ever heard sommeone say, "Mountain Dew is my favourite drink. It tastes terrible." or "I love my husband. He's the biggest idiot I've ever met"? Probably not, because these beliefs or evaluations are not consistent with each other. According to the **principle of cognitive consistency**, consumers value harmony among their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, and they are motivated to maintain uniformity among these elements. This desire means that, if necessary, consumers will change their thoughts, feelings, or behaviours to make them consistent with other experiences. **The consistency principle is an important reminder that attitudes are not formed in a vaccum.** A signitifcant determinant of the way an attitude object will be evaluated is how it fits in with other, relates attitudes already held by the consumer.

###### Subheader: COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AND HARMONY AMONG ATTITUDES
* The **theory of cognitive dissonance** states that when a person is confronted with inconsistencies among his or her own atittudes or behaviours, he or she will take some action to resolve this unpleasant psychological state of "dissonance". **The theory proposes that people are motivated to reduce the negative feelings caused by dissonance by making things fit with one another. This can be done, for example, by chanign the attitude or modifying the behaviour. The theory has important ramifications for attitudes, since peopel are often confronted by situations in which there is some conflict between their attitudes and behaviour.**
* A cognitive element can be something peopel believe about themselves, behaviours they perform, or observations about their surroundings. For example, the two belief statements "I know smoking cigarettes causes cancer" and "I smoke cigareetes" are dissonant with one another. This psychological inconsistency creates a feeling of discomfort that the smoker is motivated to reduce. The magnitude of dissonance depends on both the importance and the number of dissonant elements. **In other words, the pressure to reduce dissonance is more likely to be observed in high-involement situation in which the dissonant elements are more important to the individual.**
* Dissonance reduction can occur by eliminating, adding, or changing elements. For example, the person might stop smoking (eliminate) or remember Great-Aunt Sophie, who smoked until the day she died at age 90 (add).
* Dissonance theory can help to exaplin why evaluations of a product tend to increase after it has been purchase. Postpurchase dissonance can occur in situations where the consumer has a choice between more than one favourable alternative. For example, if the consumer narrows down her search for a new computer to two key alternatives and then selects one, dissonance can arise because the alternative she gave up (what researchers call the "forgone option") had many desirable qualities. This is because the cognition "that computer had some really cool options" and the behaviour "I picked sommething else instead" are inconsistent. This can lead to feeling of dissonance, which the consumer is motivated to resolve. **one way this can be done, is by reconfirming that she made the right purchase after all, focusing on desirable qualities of the chosen option and actually liking it more after it has been selected.**
* A field study performed at a horse race demonstrates postpurchase dissonance. Bettors evaluated their chosen horses more highly and were more confident of their success after they had placed a bet than before. Sinnce the bettor is financially committed to the choice, he or she reduces dissonance by increasing the attractiveness of the chosen alternative relative to the unchosen ones. One implication of this phenomenon is that consumers actively seek support for their purchase decisions, so marketers should supply them with additional reinforcement to build positive brand attitides.

###### Subheader: SELF-PERCEPTION THEORY
* Do attitudes necessarily change following behaviour because people are motivated to feel good about their decisions? **Self-perception theory** provides an alternative explanation of dissonance effects. it assumes that people use observations of their own behaviour to determine what their attitudes are, just as we assume that we know the attitudes of others by watching what they do. The theory states that we maintain consistency by inferring that we must have a positive attitude toward an object if we have bought or consumed it (assuming that we freely made this choice).
* **Self-perception theory is relevant to the low involvement hierarchy,** since it invovles situations in which behaviours are inititally performed in the absence of a strong internal attitude. After the fact, the cognitive and affective components of attitude fall into line. Thus, buying a product out of habit may result in a positive attitude toward it after the fact--namely, why would I buy it if i didn't like it?
* Self-perception theory helps to explain the effectiveness of a sasles strategy called the **foot-in-the-door technique**, which is based on the observation that a consumer is more likely to comply with a request if he or she has first agree to comply with a smaller request. The name for this technique comes from the practice of door-to-door selling, wherein a salesperson was taught to plant his or her foot in a door so that the prospect could not slam it shut. A good salesperson knows that he or she is more likely to get an order if the customer can be persuade to open the door and talk. By agreeing to do so, the customer has established a willingness to listen to the salesperson. placing an order is consistent with this self-perception. This technique is especially useful for inducing consumers to answer surveys or to donate money to charity. Such factors as the time lag between the first and second requests, the similarity between the two requests, and whether the same person makes both requests have been found to influence the effectiveness of this technique.
* Another variation of this strategy include the *low-ball technique*, in which a person is asked for a small favour and is informed after agreeing to it that it will be very costly. This can be contrasted against the *door-in-the-face* technique, in which a person is first asked to do something extremee (a request that is usually refused) and then is asked to do something smaller. In the latter case, people tend to go along with the smaller request, possibly **because they feel guilty about denying the larger one.**
* **SOCIAL JUDGMENT THEORY** Social judgment theory also assumes that people assimilate new information about attitude objects in light of what they already know or feel. The initial attitude acts as a *frame of reference*, and new information is categorized in terms of this existing standard. Just as our decision that a box is heavy depends in part on other boxed we have liefted, we develop a subjective standard when making judgments about attitude objects.
* An important aspect of the theory is the notion that people differ in terms of the information they will find accpetable or unacceptable. They form **latitudes of accpetance and rejection** around an attitude standard. Ideas that fall within a lattitude will be favourably received, while those falling outside the zone will not. For example, consider a consuemr who has a favourable attitude toward the use of a designated drivers. He is likely to be recpetive to communications urging him to play this role before heading out for an eventing on the town. If he were opposed to this practice, these messages would probably not be considered.
* On  the one hand, messages that fall within the latitude of acceptance tend to seen as more consistent with our own position than they actually are. This process is called an *assimilation effect*. On the other hand, messages falling in the latitude of rejection tend to be seen as even farther from our own position than they actually are, resulting in a contrast effect.
* As a person becomes more involved with an attitude object, his or her lattitude of acceptance gets smaller; in other words, the consumer accepts fewer ideas that are removed from his or her own position and tends to opppose even mildly divergent positions. This tendency is evident in ads that appeal to discriminating buyers, which claims that knowledgable people will reject anything buy the very best. On the other hand, relatively uninvolved consumers will consider a wider range of alternatives. They are less likely to be brand-loyal and more likely to switch brands

* **BALANCE THEORY** Balance theory consider relations among elements a person might perceive as belonging together. This perspective involves relations (always from the perceiver's subjective point of view) among three elements, so the resulting attitudde structres are called *triads*. Each triad contains 1) a person and his or her perception of 2) an attitude object and 3) some other person or object.
* These perception can be either positive or negative. More importantly, people alter these perceptions to make relations among them consistent. The theory specifies that people desire relations among elements in a triad to be harmonious, or balanced. If they are not, a state of tention will result until somehow perceptions are changed and balance is restored.
* Elements can be perceived as going together in one of two ways. **They can have either *unit relation*, in which one element is seen as somehow belonging to or being a part of the other (something like a belief), or a sentiment relation, in which the two elements are linked because one has expressed a prefernce (or dislike) for the other. A dating couple might be seen as having a positive sentiment relation. Unon getting married, they will have a positive unit relation. The process of divorce is an attempt to sever a unit relation.**
* To see how balance thoery might work, consider the following scenario:

                * Monica would liketo date jerry, who is in her consuemr behaviour class. In balance theory terms, Monica has a positve sentiment relation with Jerry.
                * One day Jerry shows up in class and she sees that he has a new tatoo on his arm. Jerry has a positive unit relation with the tattoo. It belongs to him and is literally a part of him.
                * monica does not like tattoos. She has a negative sentiment relation with tattoos.

* According to balance theory, Monica faces an unbalanced triad, and she will experience pressure to restore balance by altering some aspect of the triad.She might, for example, decide that she does not like Jerry after all. Or her liking for Jerry might prompt a change in her attitude toward tattoos. She might even try to negate the unit relation between Jerry and the tattoo by decing that he must have gotten it only as part of an initiation (reducing the free-choice element). Finally, she could choose to "leave the field" by not thinking any more about Jerry and his controversial tattoo.
* Note that although th theory does not specify which of these routes will be taken, it does predict that one or more of Monica's perceptions will probably change to achieve balance. Although this distortion is most likely an oversimplified representation of most attidue processes, it helps to explain a number of consuemr behaviokur phenomena.

* **MARKETING APPLICATIONS OF BALANCE THEORY** Balance theory reminds us that when perceptions are balanced, attitudes are likely to be stable. On the other hand, when inconsistencies are observed, we are more likely to observe changes in attitudes. Balance theory also helps to explain why consumers like to be associated with positively valued objects. Forming a unit relation with a popular product (buying and wearing fashionable clothing or driving a flashy car) **may improve one's chances of being included as a positive sentiment relation in other people's triads.**
* Finally, balance theory is useful in accounting for widespread use of celebrities to endorse products. **In cases where a triad is not fully formed (e.g., one involving perceptions about a new product or one about which the consumer does not yet have a well-defined attitude), the marketer can create apositive sentiment relation wbetween the consumer and the product by depicting a postive unit relation between teh product and a well-known personality. In other cases, behaviours are discouraged when admired people argue against them, as is the goal when athletes appear in public service advertisements against drinking and driving.
* The ""balancing act" is at the heart of celebrity endorsements, in which it is hoped that the star's popularity will transfer to the product. This strategy will be considered at length in the next chapter. For now, it pays to remember that this creation of a unit relation between product and star can backfire if the public opinion of the celbrity endorser shifts from positive to negative, as happened when Tiger Woods' philandering was exposed: Tag Heuer, Gillete, and Accenture all cut or suspended him as their spokesperson. **The strategy also cause trouble if the star-product unit relaiton is quesitoned, as when the celebrity gets caught using a competitor's brand.**

## Bigheader: ATTITUDE MODELS
* A consuemr's overall evalution of a product sometimes accounts for most of his or her attitude toward it. When market researchers want to assess attitudes, it can often be sufficient for them simply to ask consumers, "How do you feel about American Apparel?"
* However, as we saw earlier, attitudes can be a lot more complex than that. One problem is that a product or service may comprise many attributes, or qualities, some of which may be more important than others to particular people. Another problem is that people's decisions to act on their attitudes are affected by other factors, such as whether they feel that buying a product would be met with approval by friends or family. For these reasons, attitude models have been developed that try to specify the different elements that might work together to influence people's evaluations of attitude objects.

### Multi-attitute Atttiude Models
* A simple response does not alwaays tell us everything we need to know about either why the consumer feels a certain way toward a product or what marketers can do to change the consumer's attitude.
* Beliefs about specific brand attributes can be pivotal for a product. Warner-Lambert discovered this in research it did for its FreshBurst Listerine mouthwash. A research firm paid 37 families to set up cameras in their bathrooms to watch their daily routines. use of both listerine and rival Scope said they used mouthwash to make their breath smell good. But Scope users swished the liquid and then spit it out, while Listerine users kept the product in their mouths for a long time. These findings meant Listerine hadn't shaken its medicine-like image.
* For this reason, **multi-attribute attitude models** have been popular among marketing researchers. This type of model assumes that a consumer's attitude (evalution) of an attitude object (Ao) will depend on the beliefs he or she has about several or many attributes of the object. The use of a multi-attribute model implies that an attitude toward a product or brand can be predicted by identifying these specific beliefs and combining them to derive a measure of the consumer's overall attitude.
* We'll describe here how these work, using the example of a consumer evaluating a complex attitude object that should be very familiar to you: a grocery store. Basic multi-attribute models specify three elements:

1. Attributes are characteristics of the Ao. Most models assume that the relevant characteristics can be identified; that is, the researcher can include those attributes that consumers take into consideration when evaluating the Ao. For example, degree of freshness of produce is an attribute of a grocery store.
2. Beliefs are cognition about the specific Ao (usually relative to others similar to it). A belief measure assesses the extent to which the consumer perceives that a brand possesses a partciular attribute. For example, a student might have a belief that Sobeys has the freshest produce.
3. Importance weights reflect the relative priority of an attribute to the consumer. Although an Ao can be considered on t he basis of a number of attributes, some are likely to be more important than others (i.e., they will be given greater weight). And these weights are likely to differ across consumers. In the case of grocery stores, for example, one student might stress low prices while another might assign greater weight to fresh produce

###### Subheader: THE FISHBEIN MODEL
* The most influential multi-attribute model is called the *Fishbein model*, named after its primary developer. The model measures three components of attitude:
1. Salient beliefs people have about an Ao (those beliefs about the object that are considered during evalution)
2. Object-attribute linkages, or the probability that a particular object has an important attribute.
3. Evaluation of each of the important attributes
* Note, however, taht the model makes some assumptions that may not always be warranted. It assumes that we have been able to specify adequately all the relevant attributes that, for example, a student will use in evaluting his or her choice about which university to attend. The model also assumes that he or she will go thorugh the process (formally or informally) of identifyin a set of relevant attributes, weighing them and summing them. Althoug hthis particular decision is likely to be highly involving, it is still possible that the student's attitude will instead be formed by an overall affective response (a process known as affect-referal)
* By combining these three elements, a consumer's overall attitude toward an object can be computed (We'll see later how this equation has been modified to increase its accuracy). The basic formula is as follows

        Subbar(A,ijk)=S*Subbar(B,ijk)I(ik)

        Where i=attribute
        j= brand
        k=consumer
        I=the importance weight given attribute i by consumer k
        B=consumer k's belief regarding the extent to which brand j possesses attribute i
        A= a particular consumer k's attitude score for brand j

* the overall attitude score (A) is obtained by multiplying a consumer's rating of each attribute for all the brands considered by the importance rating for that attribute.
* To see how this basic multi-attribute model might work, let's suppose we want to predict at which grocery store Narveen is likely to do his weekly shopping. He lives more or less equidistant from different stores. To decide which one he will go to, he considers the attributes across all three stores and forms an attitude toward each store. We can ask Narveen to assign a rating regarding how well each store performs on each attribute and how important each attribute is to him. An overall attitude score for each store can then be computered by summing scores on each attribute (after weighting each by its relative importance)

###### Subheader: STRATEGIC APPLICATIONS OF THE MULTI-ATTRIBUTE MODEL
* Suppose you were the director of marketing for IGA. How might you use the data from this analysis to improve your image?
* **CAPITALIZE ON RELATIVE ADVANTAGE** If one's brand is viewed as being superior on a particular attribute, consuemrs such as Narveen need to be convinced that this particular attribute is an important one. For example, although Narveen rates fresh produce highly, he does not believe this attribute is a valued aspect for some grocery stores. As IGA's marketing director, you might emphasize the importance of fruits and vegetables in a healthy balance diet.
* **STRENGTHEN PERCEIVED PRODUCT-ATTRIBUTE LINKS** A marketer may discover that consumers do not equate his or her brand with a certain attribute. This problem is commonly addressed by campaigns that stress the product's qualityies to consumers (e.g., "new and improve ingredients"). Narveen apparently does not think much of IGA's deli. You might develop an information campaign to improve these perceptions (such as "little-known facts about IGA's deli").
* **ADD A NEW ATTRIBUTE** Product marketers frequently try to create a position distinct from those of their competitors by adding a product feature. IGA might try to emphasize some unique aspect, such as an online order system for busy people who do not like to grocery shop.
* **INFLUENCE COMPETITORS' RATINGS** Finally, you might try to decrease the positivity of competitors. This type of action is the rationale for a strategy of comparative advertising. One tactic might be to publish an ad that lists the attributes on which IGA can be favourably compared as the basis for emphasizing the value obtained for the money spent at IGA.

## Bigheader: USING ATTITUDES TO PREDICT BEHAVIOUR
* Althoug multi-attribute models have been used by consumer researchers for many years, they have been plagued by a major problem: In many cases, knowledge of a person's attitude is not a very predictor of behaviour. In a classic demonstration of "Do as I say, not as I do", many studies have obtained a very low correlation between a person's reported attitude toward something and his or her actual behaviour toward it. Some researchers have been so discouraged that they have questioned whether attitudes are of any use at all understanding behaviour. This questionable link between attitudes and behaviour can be a big headache for advertisers in that consumers can love a commercial and yet still not buy the product.

### Header: The Extended Fishbein Model
* The original model, which focused on measuring a consumer's attitude toward a product, has been extended in several ways to improve its predictive ability. An improved version is all the **theory of reasoned action**. This model contains several important additions to the original, an although the model is still not perfect, its ability to predict relevant behaviour is better. Some of the modifications to this model are considered here.

###### Subheader: INTETNTIONS VERSUS BEHAVIOUR
* Like the consuemr motivations discussed in Chapter 4, attitudes have both direction and strength. A person may like or dislike an attitude object with varying degrees of confidence or conviction. It is helpful to distinguish between firmly held attitudes and those that are more superficial, especially since an attitude held with greater conviction makes it more likely that it will be acted upon. One study on environmental issues and marketing activities found, for example ,that people who express greater conviction in their feelings regarding environmental responsible behaviours such as recycling show greater consistency between attitudes and behavioural intentions.
* However, research consistently finds that consumer attitudes don't always lead to the congruent behaviour. One challenge for marketers, then, is ensuring that consumer attitude translate into relevant consumer behaviours. Volkswagen's fun theory campaign plays on this issue by showing that we can get people to change their behaviours simply by making the activity fun! For example, by transforming a subway station's staircase into a piano, the marketers were to increase the number of people who chose the stairs over the escalator by 66 percent.
* Many factors might interfere with actual behaviour, even if the consumers has sincere intentions. He or she might save up with the intention of buying new smartphone. In the iterim, though, any of a number of things--losing a job, getting mugged on the way to the store, or arriving the store to find that the dired model is out of stock--could happen. It is not surprising, then, that in some instances past purchase behaviour has been found to be a better predictor of fugure behaviour than a consumer's behavioural intention. the theory of reasoned action aims to measure behavioural intentions, recognizing that certain uncontrollable factors inhibit prediction of acutal behaviour.
* **SOCIAL PRESSURE** The theory acknowledges the power of other people in influencing behaviour. Many of our behaviours are not determined in a vacuum. Much as we may hate to admit it, what we think others would like us to do may be more crucial that our own individual preferences. Some research approaches try to assess the extent to which people's "public" attitudes and purchase decisions might be different from what they would do if they were in private. For example, one firm uses a technique it calls "engineered theatre". Researchers go to the actual site where a product is being consumed, such as a bar. They arrange for the wrong product t o be "mistakenly" served, and the nobserve the consumer's "naked response" to the brand and his or her reaction to consuming the brand in a social context.
* A new element, the **subjective norm(SN)**, was thus added to include the effects of what we believe other people think we should do. The value of SN is arrived at by including two other factors: 1) the intensity of a *normative belief (NB)* that others think an action should be taken or not taken, or 2) the motivation to comply (MC) with that belief (i.e., the degree to which the consuemr takes others' anticipated reactions into account when evaluating a course of action or a purchase.)

###### Subheader: ATTITUDE TOWARD BUYING
* The model now measures **attitude toward the act of buying (Subbar(A,act))** rather than only the attitude toward the product itself. In other words, it focuses on the perceived consequences of a purchase. Knowing  how someone feels about buying or using an object turns out to be more valid than merely knowing the consumer's evaluation of the object itself.
* To understand this distinction, consider a problem that might arise when measuring attitudes toward condoms. Although a group of college students might have a positive atttiude toward condoms, does this necessarily predict that they will buy and use them? A better prediction would be obtained by asking the students how likely they are to buy condoms and use them during sex. Although a person might have a positive Ao toward condoms, subbar(A, act) might be negative, because of the embarrassment or the hassle involved in the act of buying.

### Header: Obstacles to Predicitn Behaviour in the Theory of Reasoned Action
* Despite improvements to the Fishbein model, problems arise when it is misaaplied. In many cases the model is applied in ways for which it was not intended or where certain assumption about human behaivour may not be warranted. Other obstacles to predicitng behaviour are as follows: 

* The model was developed to deal with actual behaviour (e.g., taking a diet pill), not with the the outcome of behaviour (e.g., losing weight) that are instead assessed in somem studies
* Some outcomes are beyond the consuemr's control, such as whe nthe purchase requires the cooperation of other people. For instance, consumers might want to get a mortgage, but this intention will be worthless if they can not find a banker to give them one.
* The basic assumption that behaviour is intentional may be invalid in a variety of cases, including those involving impulsive acts, sudden changes in one's situation, novelty-seeking, or even simply repeat buying. One study found that such unexpected event as having guests, changes in teh weather, or reading articles about the healthfulness of certain foods exerted a significant effect on actual behaviours.
* measures of attitude often do not really correspond to the behaviour they are supposed to predict, either in term of the Subbar(A,act) or when the act occur. One common problem is a difference in the level of abstraction employed. For example, knowing a person's attitude toward the environment may not predict whether he or she will purchase an electric car. It is very important to match the level of specificity between the attitude and the behavioural intention.
* A similar problem relates to the time frame of the attitude measure. In general, the longer the time between the attitude measurement and teh behaviour it is supposed to assess, the weaker the relationship will be. For example, predictability would improve markedly by asking consumers about the likelihood of buying a house in the next week as opposed within the next five years.
* **Attitudes formed by direct, personal experience with an Ao are stronger and more predictive of behaviour than those formed indirectly, such as through advertising**. According to the attitude accessbility perspective, behaviour is a function of the person's immediate perception of the Ao in the context of the situation in which it is encountered. An attitude will guide the evaluation of the object, but only if it is activated from memory when  the object is observed. **These findings underscore the importance of strategies that induce trial (by widespread product sampling to encourage the conumser to try the product at home, by taste tests, test drives, etc), as well as those that maximize exposure to marekting communications.

* The thoery of reasoned action has been applied primarily in Western settings. Certain assumptions inherent in the model may not necessity apply to consumers from other cultures. Several of the following cultural road diminish the universality of the theory of reasoned action"

* The model was developed to predict the performance of any voluntary act. Across culture, however, many consuemr activities, ranging from taking exams and entering military service to receiving an inoculation of choosing a marriage partner, are not necessarily voluntary.
* The relative impact of subjective norms may vary across cultures. For example, Asian cultures tend to value conformity and face-saving, so it is possible that subjective norms involving the anticipated reactions of others to the choice will have an even greater impact on behaviour for many Asian consumers. Indeed, a study conducted among voters in Singapore was able to predict voting for political candidates from their voting intentions, which in turn were influenced by such factors as voters' attitudes toward the candidate, attitudes toward the political party, and subjective norms--which in Singapore included an emphasis on harmonious and close ties among members of the society.
* The model measures behavioural intentions and thus presupposes that consumers are actively thinking ahead and planning future behaviours. The intention concept assumes that consumers have a linear time sense (i.e., that they think in terms of past, present, and future). This perspective on time is not held in all culture.

### Header: Types of Normative Influence
* Robert Cianldini and his colleagues highlight that norms are best divided into two categories. The first classification is **descriptive norms**, defined as norms that **convey information regarding what other people commonly do**. For example, an advertisement communicating that 85 percent of residents are currently recycling is communicating a descriptive norm. The second classification is **injunctive norms**, defined as norms that convey information regarding what is commonly approved and disapproved of by others. An advertisement, highlighting that other approve of recycling would convey an injunctive norm. Both types of norms can be powerful influencers on consumer attitudes and behaviour.
* Communicating that others are engaging in a particular activity can increase compliance with that behaviour. This has been shown for consumption behaviours such as not littering, reducing energy consumption, and even voting. One strategy that has been used to harness the power of descrptive norms and ensure they translate into positive attitudes and behaviours is to give consumers feedback on how they are performing, relative to the descriptive norm. For example, Opower is a privately held software-as-a-service company that partners with utility providers to encourage consuemrs to conserve household energy. Opower's software creates individualized Home Energy Reports that analyze consumers' energy use and compares this to what others are doing.
* In another example of using social norms to impact conservation behaviours, Cialdini and his colleagues gave hotel guests different messages to encourage them to reuse their towels. Two version of  the message are created. one of the messages simply told about the energy conservation program were created and made a more traditional environmental appeal: "HELP SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. You can show your respect for nature and help save teh environment by reusing your towels during your stay." The other version provided a descriptive norm: "JOIN YOUR FELLOW GUESTS IN HELPING TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. Almost 75% of guests who are asked to partipate in our new resource saving program do help by using their towels more than once. you can join your fellow guests in this program to help save the environment by reusing your towels during your stay." The hotel's attendants were trained to record whether guests partipated in the program.
* The results hsowed that people received t he normative message were more likely to reuse their towels (44 percent) than those who received a more traditional environmental appeal (35 percent). In a subsequent study the authors varied other information presented to guests. The researchers foudn that the most compliance with the energy conservation program occured when teh descriptive norm was linked to other guests who stayed in the same hotel room. For example, guests who also read: "In a study conducted in Fall 2003, 75% of guests who stayed in this room partipated in our new resource saving program by using their towels more than once" were most likely to participate in the towel reuse program (49 percent). It seems that cues that connect the descriptive norm to the immediate setting (such as the specific hotel room the guest is staying in) enhancing the impact of the descriptive norm.

# Chapter 8: Atttiude Change and Interactive Communications

## Bigheader: CHANGING ATTTITUDE THROUGH COMMUNICATION
* As consumers, we are constantly bombarded by messages inducing us to chnage our attitudes. These attempts can range from logical arguments to graphic pictures, and from intimidation by peers to exhortations by celebrity spokespersons. And communications flow both ways--the consumer may seek out informatio nsources to learn more about these options. A person's choice to access marketing messages on his or her own terms is changin the way we think about persuasion attempts.
* This chapter will review some of the factors that help determine the effectiveness of such communication devices. Our focus will be on some basic aspects of communication that specifically help to determine how and if attitudes will be created or modified . This objective relates to **persuasion**, which refers to an active attempt to change attitudes. Persuation is the central goal of many marketing communications.
* We'll learn more about how marketers try to accomplish this throughout the chapter, but for now we can set the stage by listing some basic psychological principles that influence people to change their minds or comply with a request.

* **Reciprocity**: People are more likely to give if they receive something first. That's why including a nominal amount of money (such as a dollar) in a mall survey questionaire increases the response rate by an average of 65 percent over the number of responses to mail surveys without a monetary incentive.
* **Scarcity**: Items become more attractive when they are less available. In one study that asked people to rate the quality of chocolate chip cookies, particpants who only got two cookies liked them better than those who got ten of the same kind of cookie. That helps to explain why we tend to value "limited edition" items.
* **Authority**: we tend to believe an authoritative source much more readily. CNN.com carries more weight with respect to public opinion that does TMZ.com. We'll talk more about the importance of who delivers the message later in this chapter.
* **Consistency**: As we saw in the last chapter, people try not to contradict themselves in terms of what they say and do about an issue. In one study, students who solicited donations to help people with disabilities doubled the amount they normally collected in a neighbourhood by first asking the residents to sign a petion supporting people with disabilities **two weeks before asking for donations**. The act of committing t oa small sign of support (signing a petition) beforehand led people to be more likely to consistently follow through on a later larger request (making a charitable contribution).
* **Consensus**: We often take into account what others are doing before we decide what to do. We'll talk more about the power of conformity in Chapter 11. This desire to fit in with what others are doing influences our actions; for example, people are more likely to donate to a charity if they first see a list of the names of their neighbours who have already done so.

### Header: Decisions, Decisions: Tactical Commmunications Options
* Suppose that a perfume company wants to create an advertising comapign for a new fragrance. As it plans this campaign, it must develop a message that will create desire for the perfume in potential consumers. To craft persuasive messages a number of questions must be answered:

* **Who will be depicted as using the scent in an ad?** Should it be linked to a glamorous celebrity? A career woman? A rock star? The source of a message helps to determien consumer's acceptance of it, as well as their desire to try the product.
* **How should the message be constructed?** Should it emphasize the negative consequnces of smelling badly? Should it directly compare the fragrance with others already on the market, or perhaps a fantasy in which a princess is swpet off her feet by a dashing knight after she applies the scent? Product benefits can be expressed in many ways.
* **What media should be used to transmit the message?** Should it be depicted in a print ad? Online through social media? Should it be sold using outdoor advertising such as billboards? if a print ad is produced, should it be run in the pages of Vogue? Canadian Living? Details? Sometimes where something is said can be as important as what is said. Ideally, the attributes of  the product should be matched with those of the medium. **For example, magazines with high prestige are more effective at communicating messages about overall product image and quality, while specialized expert magazines do a better job at conveying factual information**
* What characteristics of the target market might influence the ad's acceptance? **If targeted users are frustrated in their daily lives, these women might be more receptive to a fantasy appeal.** **If they don't tend to wear perfume, they may not pay any attention to a traditional perfume add at all**

### Header: The Elements of Communication
* marketers and advertisers have traditionally tried to understand how marketing messages change consumers' attitudes by thinking in terms of **communications model**
* In this model, a source must choose and encode a message (i.e.,g initiate the transfer of meaning by choosing appropriate symoblic images that represent this meaning). There are many ways to say something, and teh structure of the message has a big effect on how it is perceived. The message must be transmitted via a medium, which might be television, social media, magazines, billboards, or even T-shirt. The message is then decoded by one or more receiveers, who interpret the symbols in the light of their own experiences. Finally, feedback must be received by the source, who uses the reactions of receivers to modify aspects of the message. 

## Bigheader: AN UPDATED VIEW: INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
* Although the traditional communications model is not entirely wrong, it does not tell the whole story--especially in today's dynamic world of interactivity in which consumers have many more choices available to them and greater control over which messages they will choose to process. In fact, a popular strategy known as **permission marketing** is based on the idea that a marketer will be much more successful trying to persuade consumers who have opted into their messages; consumers who "opt out" of listening to the message probably weren't good prospects in the first place. On the other hand, those who say they are interested in learning more are likely to be receptive to marketing communications they have already chosen to see or hear. As the permission marketing concept reminds us, we don't have to just sit there and take it. We have a voice in deciding which messages we choose to see and when--and we are exercising that option more and more.
* The traditional model was developed to understand mass communications, in which information is transferred from a producer (source) to many consumers (receivers) at once--typically via print, television, or radio. This perspective essentially views advertising as perishable; it is repeated (perhaps frequently) for a fairly short period of time, and then it "vanishes" as a new campaign eventually takes its place.
* This classic model was strongly influenced by a group of theorists known as the *Frankfurt shcool*, which dominated mass-communications research for most of the twentieth century. In this view the media exert direct and powerful effects on individuals, and the effects often are used by those in power to brainwash and exploit them. The receiver is basically a passive being--a "couch potato" who is simply the receptacle for many messages and is often duped or persuaded to act on the basis of the information he or she is "fed".

### Header: uses and Gratifications
* Is this an accurate picture of the way we relate to marketing communications? Proponents of **use and gratifications theory** argue instead that consumers are an active, goal-directed audience that draws on mass media as a resource to satisfy needs. Instead of asking what media do for or to people, they ask what people do with their media.
* The uses and gratification approach emphasizes that media compete with other sources to satisfy needs and that these needs include diversion and entertainment as well as information. This also means that the line between marketing information and entertainment is continuing to blur--especially as companies are being forced to design more attractive retail outlets, catalogues, and websites to induce consumers to stop at them.
* Indeed, research interviews with young people in Great Britain found that they rely on advertising for many gratifications, including entertainment (some report that the "advert" are better than the programs), escapism, play (some report singing along with jingles, others make posters out of magazine ads), and self-affirmation (ads can reinforce people's own values or provide role models). It's important to note that this perspective is not arguing that media play a uniformly positive rol in our lives, only that recipients are making use of the information in a number of ways. For example, marketing messages have the potential to undermine self-esteem as consumer use the media to establish unrealistic standards for behaviour, attitudes, or even their own appearance. A comment by one study participant illustrates this. She observes that when she's watching television with her boyfriend, "really, it make you think, 'Oh no, what must I be like? I mean, you're sitting with your boyfriend and he's saying, "Oh, look at her. What a body!'".

### Header: Consumer Interactivity
* Consumers who are highly involved with a product and who want to share their opinions with manufacturers are an invaluable (and often free) form of input that can shape marketing decisions in important ways. When the consumer interacts with the marketers to influence the product, service, or outcome that is created that is called customer co-creation. There has recently been a surge in examples of marketers offering consumers way to customize their products from altering the specs on a Dell computer to design your own Nike running shoe. Giving the customer a voice in how the product is offered often lead to not only more innovative solutions, but also greater consumer engagement.
* Consider these examples:
* The beauty division of the NPD Group, which tracks retail purchases, noticed that a producgt intended to reduce stretch marks called StriVectin-SD selling exceptionally well at department store beauty counters. The firm found that about 75 percent of buyers were actually using it on their faces as a wrinkle fighter. Taking heed of this new use for the product, its manufacturer unveiled a new advertising slogan "Better than Botox?"
* Virtually every component of Jones Soda, from labels to flavours, comes from customers. The company gets suggestisons for offbeat flavours (including chocolate fudge and green apple), wacky names (Whoop Ass and MF Grape), and neon colours. Even the "Deep Thoughts" quotes found underneath the bottle cap ("76.4$ of all statistics are meaningless") come straight from Jone enthusiasts.
* Danone went to consumers when its reduced-fat Light & Fit yogurts were not selling well against rivals'. The company emailed 40,000 men and women and asked them to click on a link to help create a new product and get a shot at winning $10,000. They evaluated a series of yogurt containers with different combinations of name, package design, nutritional labelling, and size. By the end of the project, researchers had decided that the yogurt should be called Carb Control, come in a red container, and be sold in a four-pack of four-ounce cups, and that the label should appeal to dieters by highlighting the claims of "80% less sugar" and "3 grams of carbs"

### Header: Who's in Charge of the Remote
* Whether for good or bad, though, exciting technological and social developments certainly are forcing us to rethink picture of the passive consumer, as people are increasingly playing a proactive role in communications. In other words, they are to a greater extent becoming partners--rather than potatos--in the communications process; their input is helping to shape the message they and others like them receive. Furthermore, they may seek out these messages rather than sit at home and wait to see them on television or in the paper. 
* One of the early signs of this communication revolution was the humble handheld remote control device. As VCRs began to be commonplace in homes, suddenly consumers had more input into what they wanted to watch--and when. No longer were they at the mercy of the television networks to decide when to see their favourite shows, and neither did they necessarily have to forsake a show because it conflicted with another's time slot.
* Since that time, of course, our ability to control our media environment has mushroomed. Just ask some of the almost 10 million people who are now using DVRs to watch TV shows whenever they wish--and who are skipping over the commercials. Many people also have access to video-on-demand on pay-per-view TV. Home shopping networks encourage us to call in and discuss our passion for cubic zirconium live on t he air. Caller ID allows us to decide whether we will accept a phone call and to know the source of the message before picking up the phone. A bit of Web surfing allows us to identify kindred spirits around the globe, the request information about products, and to even provide suggestions to product designers and market researchers.

### Header: New Message Formats
* An array of new ways to transmit information in both text and picture form offers marketers exciting alternatives to traditional advertising on TV, billboards, magazines, and so on. Mobile commerce, in which marketers promote their goods and services via wireless devices, including smartphone and tablets, is now commonplace. In Asia, tiny cellphone screens have become electronic wallets that buy Cokes from vending machines and devices that dole out McDonald's coupons on the phone screen. Among the Chinese, cell phones have become such important status symbols that relatives at funeral rites burn paper cellphone effigies so the dead will have their mobiles in the afterlife.
* In you're on Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin, you're one of the billion people that analysts project will use social media applications globally within five years. This term refers to the set of technologies that enable users to create content and share it with a large number of others. Social media are so widespread that in the United States and other developed countries, more people use these platforms than use email--and the time people spend on these networks is growing three times faster than the rate of overall participation online.

Social media platforms include:
* Blogs: Diary-like entries posted to the Web. Blogging started as a grassroots movement in which individuals shared their thoughts on a range of topics from the mumdane to the profound. Analysts estimate that two-thirds of all American INternet users will post and read blogs on a regular basis by 2012.
* Video blogging (vlogging): Posting video diaries on sites such as Youtube.
* Podcasting: Broadcasting your own radio show that people can listen to either on their computers on their iPods.
* Virtual world: SKIM
* Microblog: SKIM
* Social Network: SKIM
* Widget: SKIM

### Header: Levek of Interactive Response
*  A key to understanding the dynamics of interactive marketing communications is to consider exactly what is meant by a response. The early perspective on communications regarded feedback primarily in terms of behaviour: Did the recipient run out and buy the laundry detergent after being exposed to an ad for it?
* However, a variety of other responses are possible as well, including building awareness of the brand, informing us about product features, reminding us to buy a new package when we've run out, and--perhaps most importantly--building a long-term relationship. Therefore, a transaction is one type of response, but forward-thinking marketers realize that customers can interact with them in other valuable ways as well. For this treason it is helpful to distinguish between two basic types of feedback:

* First-order response: Direct-marketing vehicles such as catalogues and TV informercials are interactive, if successful they result in an order, which is most definitely a response! So let's think of a product offer that directly yields a transaction as a first-order response. In addition to providing revenue, sales data are a valuable source of feedback that allows marketers to gauge the effectiveness of their communications efforts.
* Second-order response: A marketing communication does not have to immediately result in a purchase to be an important component of interactive marketing. Messages can prompt useful responses from customers, even though these recipients do not necessarily place an order immediately after being exposed to the communication. Customer feedback in response to a marketing message that is not in the form of a transaction is a second-order response. For example, one key metric marketers are becoming increasingly interest in a social media responses to their brands.

* **THE ROLE OF PERSUASION KNOWLEDGE** The Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM) suggests that consumers develop knowledge about persuasion and use this knowledge to "cope" with or deal with persuasive attempts. This model views the exchange between teh consumer and the persuasion agent as a two-way interaction, in which both the consumer and the agent have their own goals. The model also suggests that the target has three types of knowledge: topic knowledge (speicific knowledge related to the issue at hand), agent knowledge (knowledge about the source of the persuasion), and persuasion knowledge (knowledge about the persuasive tactics and techniques being used)
* Persuasion knowledge refers to consumers' theories effectiveness and appropriateness of beliefs about marketers' motives and tactics; the effectiveness and appropriateness of persuasion tactics; and ways of copying with persuasion attempts. Consumers' persuasion knowledge is understood to "hover in readiness" to help them form attitudes about the influence agent or the product. The theory suggests that consumers use their knowledge about such persuasive attempts to get the best outcome for themselves. importantly, if consumers attribute negative motives to the persuaisve agent, such as a salesperson, they may be less easily persuaded or may negatively evalute the individual.

## Bigheader: SOURCE
* Common sense tells us that the same words uttered by different people can have very different effects. Research on source effects has been carried out for more than 45 years. By attributing the same message to different sources and measuring the degree of attitude change that occurs after listeners hear it, researchers have found it is possible to determine what aspects of a communication will induce attitude change.
* Under most conditions, the source of a message can have a big impact on the likelihood the message will be accepted. The choice of a source to maximize attitude change can tap into several dimensions. The source can be chosen because he or she is an expert, attractive, famous, or even a "typical" consumer who is both likeably and trustworthy. Two important source characteristics are credibility and attractiveness.
* how do marketing specialists decide whether to stress either credibility or attractiveness when choosing a message source? There should be a match between the needs of the recipient and the potential rewards offered by the source. When this match occurs, the recipient is more motivated to prcess the message. People who tend to be sensitive about social acceptance and the opinion of others, for example, are more persuaded by an attractive source, whereas those who are more internally oriented are swayed by a credible, expert source.
* The choice may also depend on the type of product. A positive source can help to reduce risk and increase message acceptance overall, but particular types of sources are more effective at reducing different kinds of risk. **Experts are effective at changing attitude toward utilitarian products that have high performance risk, such as vacuum (i.e., they may be complex and not work as expected). *Celebritites* are more effective when they focus on products such as jewellery and funiture that have high social risk; the user of such products is aware of their effect on the impression others have of him or her. Finally, "typical" consumers, who are appealing sources because of their similarity to the recipient, tend to be most effective when providing real-life endorsements to everyday product that are low-risk, such as cookies.**

### Header: Source Credibility
* Source credibility refers to a communicator's expertise, objectivity, or trustworthiness. This dimension relates to consumers' beliefs thta this person is competent and will provide the necessary information we need when we evaluate competing products. Sincerity is particularly important when a commpany tries to publicize its corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity that benefit the community in some way. When consumers believe it's genuinely doing good things, a company's image can skyrocket. But this effort can backfire if people question the organization's motivations (e.g., if they think the firm spends more t o talk about its good deeds than acutally do them). Not too surprisingly, people who see deceptive advertising experience a feeling of distrust that carries over to other messages from that source and even to other sources because they are more likely to asseume that advertising in general is not very credible--a true case of poisoning the well for other marketers.
* **A credible source is particularly persuasive when the consumer has yet to learn much about a product or form an opinion of it.** Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that simply letting consumers know a firm is profitable leads them to put more stock in what the company says in its advertising. One widely used technique to generate credibility is to pay an expert or a celebrity to tout a product--but this kind of endorsement doesn't come cheap. However, typically the investment is worth it, simply because market analysts use the announcement of an endorsement contract to evaluate a firm's potential profitability, which affect its expected return. On average, the impact of endorsements on stock returns appears to be so positive that it offsets the cost of hiring the spokesperson.
* Indeed, a report on the use of celebrities in marketing reported that das that contained a celebrity endorser produced 9.4 percent higher consumer readership than ads without a celebrity endorser. Celebrities increase awareness of a firm's advertising and enhance both company image and brand attitudes. **A celebrity endorsement strategy can be an effective way to differentiate among similar products.** This is especially important when consumers do not perceive many actual differences among competitors, as often occurs when brands are in the mature stage of the product life cycle.
* And, the early evidence indicates that celebrities exert the same impact on messages we receive from social media platforms. One study found that brand endorsements streamed by celebrities directly to friends and followers on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are significantly more effective (in fact, greater than 50 percent more) than conventional display ads placed on social media pages. The celebrities in the study included Drew Brees, Snoop Dogg, Matt Hasselbeck, Enrique Iglesias, Khloe Kardashian, Nick Swisher, and Kendra Wikinson.
* Although in general more positive sources tend to increase attitude change, there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes we can think a source is obnoxious, yet it is still effective. In some instances the differences in attitude change between positive sources and less positive sources become erased over time. After a while, people appear to "forget" about the negative source and change their attitudes anyways. We call this process the sleeper effect.

###### Subheader: BUILDING CREDIBILITY
* Credibility can be enhanced if **the source's qualifications are perceived as relevant to the product being endorsed.** This link can overcome other objections people might have to the endorser on the product. For example, LeBron James uses Nike basketball shoes. One might hate Nike, or LeBron, yet see the results that LeBron gets using the brand. It's important to note that what is credible to one consumer segment may be a turnoff to another. Indeed, rebellious, even deviant celebrities may be attractive to some for just that reason. Tommy Hilfiger cultivated a rebellious, street-smart image by using rapper Snoop Dogg (acquitted of murder charges) to help launch his line, and rapper Coolio (former crack addict and thief) as a runway model. Parents might not be thrilled by these sources--but isn't that the point?

###### Subheader: SOURCE BIASES
* A consumer's beliefs about a product's attributes can be weakened if the source is perceived to be the victim of bias in presenting information. Knowledge bias implies that a source's knowledge about a topic is not accurate. *Reporting bias* occurs when a source has the required knowledge but his or her willingness to convey it accurately is compromised, as when a star tennis player is paid by a racket manufacturer to use its products exclusively. Although his or her credentials might be appropriate, the fact that the expert is perceived as a "hired gun" commpromises believability. Of course, it's not always clear that a person has been paid to say he or she loves a product. Microsoft was criticized when the software company offered to pay "travel costs" for professors if they presented papers at conferences and mentioned how Microsoft programs helped them in their work.

### Header: Hype versus Buzz: The Corporate Paradox
* Obviously many marketers spend lavishly to create marketing messages that they hope wiill convince hordes of customers that their products or services are the best. There's the rub--in many cases they may be trying too hard! We can think of this as the **corporate paradox**--the more involved a company appears to be in the dissemination of news about its products, the less credible it becomes. As we'll see in Chapter 11, consumer word of mouth is typically the most convincing kind of message. As Table 8-1 shows, **buzz** is word of mouth viewed as authentic and generated by customers. In contrast, **hype** is word of mouth dismissed as inauthentic--propaganda planted by a company. **So the challenge to marketers is to get the word out there without looking as though they are working at it.**
* Some marketers are trying to borrow the veneer of buzz by mounting "stealth' campaigns that seem as if they are untouched by the corporate world. *Buzz building* has become the new mantra at many companies that recognize the power of underground word of mouth. Indeed, a bit of cottage industry has sprung up as some firms begin to specialize in the corporate shill business by planting comments on weebsites made to look as if they originate from actual consumers. Consider these examples:

* Dodge's Ram truck made a splash with a website supposedly generated by fans to organize drag races in several cities. The site features amateurishly shot footage of a drag race and contains no reference to Dodge--just a shot of the Ram's grille. Staged drag races were held where, of course, only Ram trucks emerged victorious. Videos of the wins were then posted to the website. Bogus letters were sent to editors of local newspapers protesting the rise in street racing and mentioning the Dodge Ram involvement. Supposedly, the marketing campaign was so hush-hush even the top brass at the company were kept in the dark
* When RCA Records wanted to create a buzz around pop singer Christina Aguilera, they hired a team of young people to swarm the Web and chat about her on popular teen sites such as www.alloy.com, www.bolt.com and www.gurl.come. Posing as fans, they posted entries raving about her new material. Just before one of her albums debuted, RCA also hired a direct-marketing company to email electronic postcards filled with song snippets and biographical information to 50,000 email addresses. The album quickly went to number one on the charts.

* Powerful as these tactics are, they have the potential to poison the well in a big way. Consumers, already skeptical about what they see and hear, may get to the point where they assume every "authentic" site they find is really a corporate front. Until then, however, buzz-building online is going strong.

* **MY: buzz-building is useful**

                Hype: Advertising, overt, Corporate, Fake, Skeptism
                Buzz: Word of mouth, Covert, Grassroots, Authentic, Credibility


### Header: Source Attractiveness
* Source attractiveness refers to the source's perceived social value. This quality can emanate from the person's physical appearance, personality, or social status, or from his or her similarity to the receiver (we like to listen to people who are like us). A compelling source has great value, and endorsement deals are constantly in the works. Even dead sources can be attractive: The great grandson of the artist Renoir isputting his famous ancestor's name on bottled water, and the Picasso family has licensed their name to the French automaker Citroen.

###### Subheader: WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IS GOOD
* Almost everywhere we turn, beautiful people are trying to persuade us to buy or do something. Our society puts a very high premium on physical attractiveness, and we tend to assume that people who are good-looking are smarter, cooler, and happier. Such an assumption is called a **halo effect**, which occurs when individuals who are rated highly on one dimension are assumed to excel on others as well. The effect can be explained in terms of the consistency principle, discussed in Chapter 7, which states that people are more comfortable when all of their judgments about a person go together. This notion has been called the "what is beautiful is good" sterotype.
* A physical attractive source tends to facilitate attitude change. His or her degree of attractiveness exerts at least a modest effect on consumers' purchase intentions or product evaluation. How does this happen?
* One explanation is that physical attractiveness functions as a cue that faciliates or modifies information processing by directing consumers' attention to relevant marketing stimuli. Some evidence indicates that consumers pay more attention to ads, though not necessarily to the ad copy, that contain attractive model. In other words, an ad with a beautiful person may stand a better chance of getting noticed but not necessarily of being read. Although we may enjoy looking at a beautiful person, these positive feelings do not necessarily affect product attitudes or purchase intentions.
* Beauty can also function as a source of information. The effectiveness of highly attractive spokespeople in ads appears to be largely limited to those situations where the advertised product is overted related to attractiveness or sexuality. The social adaptation perspective assumes that information seen to being instrumental in forming an attitude will be more heavily weighted by the perceiver; we filter out irrelevant information to minimize cognitive effort. Under the right circustances an endorser's level of attractiveness constitutes a source of information instrumental to the attitude-change process. An attractive spokesperson, for this reason, is more likely to be an effective attitudes toward ads about perfume or cologne (where attractiveness is relevant) but not toward coffee ads, where attractiveness is not relevant.

###### Subheader: STAR POWER: CELEBRITIES AS COMMUNICATION SOURCES
* Celebrities hawk everything from grills (George Foreman) to perfumes (Justin Bieber). As our discussion about the consistency principle illustrates, these messages are more effective when there's logical connection between the star and the product. When Bob Dylan--who wrote lyrics such as "Advertising signs that con you/Into thinking you're the one/That can do what's never been done/That can win what's never been won"--pitches Victoria's Secret lingerie, marketers may need to reread their consumer behaviour textbook. Then again, teen idol Justin Bieber has been putting his name on almost everything, including ... nail polish.
* More generally, star power works because celebrities embody cultural meanings; they symbolize important categories, such as status and social class. Ideally, the advertiser decides what meanings the product should convey (i.e., how it should be positioned in the marketplace) and then chooses a celebrity who has come to evoke a similar meaning. The product's meaning thus moves from the manufacturer to the consumer, using the star as a vehicle.
* For celebrity campaigns to be effective, the endorser must have a clear and popular image. In addition, **the celebrity's image and that of the product he or she endorses should be similar**; this effect is known as the **match-up hypothesis**. Many promotional strategies employing stars fail because the endorser has not been selected carefully enough; some marketers just assume that because a person is "famous", he or she will serve as a successful spokesperson.
* As noted above, the effectiveness of celebrities as communications sources often depends on their perceived credibility. Consumers may not trust a celebrity's motives for endorsing a product, or they may question the star's competence to evaluate the product's claims critically. The lack of credbility is aggravated by instances in which celebrities have endorsed products that they do not really believe in or in some cases do not use.
* And of course, sometimes celebrities don't behave in ways sponsors approve of. The downfall of Tiger Woods as a suitable endorser for many brands is a good example. After his many infidelitites were made public, both Accenture and Gillette cut him loose very quickly. The balance theory of attitude (see chapter 7) helps to predict this downfall, as these companies did not want the negative image of a sexually promiscuous individual associated with their brand.

###### Subheader: NON-HUMAN ENDORSER
* Celebriries can be effective endorsers, but there are drawbacks to using them. As noted previously, their motives may be suspect if they plug products that don't fit their image, or if they come to be seen as never having met a product they didn't like (for a fee). They may be involved in a scandal or upset customers, as when the Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps got photographed smoking pot.
* For these reasons, some marketers seek alternatives, including catoon characters and mascots. After all, as the marekting director of a company that manufactures costumed characters for sport teams and businesses points out, "You don't have to worry about your mascot checking into rehab".
* One example of non-human endorsers is avatars. Avatars originated in computer games such as the Sims, but now they are starting to appear in online advertising and on e-commerce sites as a mechanism for enhancing the online experience. Rock band, soft-drink makers, and other big-time marketers are using avatars. Coca-Cola recently launched an avatar-populated site for the Hong Kong market in which avatars mill around the chat in Coke-spoonsored world. British Telecom is also testing such products as avatar email, which is software that makes the sender's face appear and speak the message aloud.
* one advantage of virtual advatars compared to flesh-and-blook models is that it's possible to change them in real time to suit the needs of the target audience or individual consumer. **From an advertising perspective, using avatars is likely to be more cost-effective than hiring a real person. From a personal selling and customer service perspective, they have the ability to handle multiple customers at any one time, they are notgeograhically limited, and they are operational 24/7, freeing up company employees and sales personnel to perform other activities.**

## Bigheader: MESSAGE
* A major study of more than 1000 commercials identified factors that appear to determine whether a commercial message will be persuasive. The single most important feature was whether the communication contained a brand-differentiating message. In other words, did the communication stress a unique attribute or benefit of the product? Other good and bad elements are depicted in Table 8-2:

                Table 8-2: Positive and Negative Effects in Television Commercials

                Positive Effects: 
                        * Showing convenience of use
                        * Showing new product or improved features
                        * Casting background (i.e.,g people are incidental to message)
                        * Indirect comparison with other products
                        * Demonstration of the product in use
                        * Demonstration of tagnible results (e.g., bouncy hair)
                        * An actor playing the role of an ordinary person
                        * No principal character (i.e., more time is devoted to the product)

                Negative Effects:
                        * Extensive information on components, ingredients, or nutrition
                        * Outdoor setting (message gets lost)
                        * Large number of on-screen characters
                        * Graphic displays

* The characteristics of the commercial message itself help to determine the impact of that message is said as well as what is actually said. Some of the issues facing marketers include the following:

1. Should the message be conveyed in words or pictures?
2. How concrete or vivid should the arguments and imagery be?
3. how often should the message be repeated?
4. Should both sides of an argument be presented?
5. Should a conclusion be drawn, or should this be left up to the listener/viewer?
6. Is it effective to explicitly compare a product with that of competitors?
7. Should a balant sexual apepal be used?
8. Should the ad be funny?
9. Should negative emotions, such as fear, ever be aroused?

### Header: Sending the Message
* The saying "one picture is worth a thousand words" captures the idea that visual stimuli can economically deliver a big impact, especially when the communicator wants to influence the receivers' emotional responses. For this reason, advertisers often put great emphasis on vivd and creative illustration or photography.
* On the other hand, a picture is not always as effective at communciating factual information. Ads that contain the same information, presented in either visual or verbal form, have been found to elicit different reactions. The verbal version affects ratings on the utilitarian aspects of a product, while the visual version affects aesthetic evaluations. Verbal elements are more effective when reinforced by an accompanying picture, especially if the illustration is framed (i.e., the message in the picture is strongly related to the copy)
* Because it requires more effort to process, **a verbal message is most appropriate for high-involvement situations, such as in print context where readers are motivated to pay attention to advertising**. Because verbal material decays more rapidly in memory, more frequent exposures are needed to obtain the desire effect. Visual images, in contrast, allow the receiver to chunk information at the time of encoding (see Chapter 3 on memory processes). Chunking results in a stronger memory trace, which aids retrieval over time.
* Visual elements may affect brand attitudes in one of two ways. First, the consuemr may form inferences about the brand and change his or her bleiefs because of an illustration's imagery. For example, people who saw an ad for a facial tissue accompanied by a photo of a sunset were more likely to believe that the brand came in attractive colours. Seocond, brand attitudes may be affected more directly. A strong positive or negative reaction elicited by the visual elements will influence the consumer's attitude toward the ad (Subbar(A,ad)), which will then affect brand attitude (subbar(A,b)). 

###### Subheader: VIVIDNESS
* Both pictures and words can differ in vividness. Powerful descriptions or graphics command attention and are **more strongly embedded in memory because they tend to activate mental imagery**, while abstract stimuli inhibit this process. Of course, this effect can cut both ways. Negative information presented in a vivid manner may result in more negative evaluations at a later time.
* The concrete discussion of a product attribute in ad copy also influences the importance of that attribute, because more attention is drawn to it. For example, the copy for a watch taht read "according to industry sources, three out of every four watch breakdown s are due to water getting into the case" weas more effective than the version that read "According to industry source, many watch breakdowns are due to water getting into the case"

###### Subheader: REPETITION
* Repetition can be a two-edged sword for marketers. As noted in Chapter 3, multiple exposures to a stimulus are usually required for learning (especially conditioning) to occur. Contrary to the saying "familiarity breeds contempt", people tend to like things that are more familar to them, even if they were not that keen on them initially. This phenomenon is known as the mere exposure effect. Positive effects for advertising reptition are found even in mature product categories; repeating product informaiton has been shown to boost consumers' awwareness of the brand even though nothing new has been said. On the other hand, too much repetition creates habituation, wherein the consumer no longer pays attention to the stilumus because of fatigue or boredom. Excessive exposure can cause advertising wearout, which can result in negative reactions to an ad after seeing it too much.
* The fine line between familarity and boredom has been explained by the **two-factor theory**, which proposed that two separate psychological processes are operating when a person is repeated exposed to an ad. The positive side of repetition is that it increases familarity and thus reduces uncertainty about the product. The negative side is that, over time, boredom increases with each exposure. At some point the amount of boredom incurred begins to exceed the amount of uncertainty reduced, resulting in wearout. This pattern is depicted in Figure 8-4. Its effect is especially pronounced in cases where each exposure is of a fairly long duration (such as a 60-second commercial)
* The theory implies that advertiser can overcome this problem by **limiting the amount of exposure per repetition (e.g., by using 15-second spots)**. They can also maintain familiarity but alleviate boredom by slightly varying the execution of ads over time through campaigns that revolve around a commmon theme (for which each spot may be different). Recipients who are exposed to varied ads about the product absorb more informaiton about product attributes and experience more positive thoughts about the brand than do those exposed repeatedly to the same information. This addition information allows the person to resist attempt to change his or her attitude in teh face of a counterattack by a competing brand.

### Header: Constructing the Argument
* Many marketing messages are similar to debates or trials, in which someone presents arguments and tries to convince the receiver to shift his or her opinion accordingly. the way the argument is presented can thus be very important.

###### Subheader: ONE- VERSUS TWO-SIDED ARGUMENTS
* Most messages merely present one or more positive attributes about the product or reasons to buy it. These are known as supportive argument. An alternative is to use a two-sided message, in which both positive and negative information is presented. Research has indicated that two-sided ads ca nbe quite effective, yet they are not widely used.
* Why would a marketer want to devote advertising space to a product's negative attributes? under the right circumstances, the use of refutational arguments, in which a negative issue is raised and then dismissed, can be quite effective. **This approach can increase source credibility by reducing reporting bias. Also, people who are skeptical about he product may be mroe receptive to a balanced argument as opposed to a "whitewash"**
* This is not to say that the marketer should go overboard in presenting major problems with product. In the typical refutational strategy, **relative minor attributes** are discussed taht may present a problem or fall short when a product is compared with competitiors. These drawbacks are then **refuted by emphasizing positive, important attributes**. Avis got a lot of mileage out of claiming to be only "No.2" while an ad for Volkswagen woefully described one of its car as a "lemon" because there was a scartch on teh glove-compartment chrome strip.
* A two-sided strategy appears to be **most effective when the audience is well educated** (and presumbly more impressed by a balance argument). it is also best used when receivers are not already loyal to the product; "preaching to teh converted" about possible drawbacks may raise doubts unnecessarily.

###### Subheader: DRAWING CONLCUSIONS
* A related issue is whether the argument should draw conclusions or whether the points should merely be presented, permitting the consumer to arrive as his or her own conclusion. Should the message say only "Our brand is superiod", ro should it add "You should buy our brand?" On the one hand, consumers who make their own inferences instead of being spoonfed will form stronger, more accessible attidues. On the other, leaving the conclusion ambiguous increases the chance that the desired attitude will not be formed.
* The response to this issue depends on the consuemrs' motivation to process the ad and the complexity of the arguments. **If the message is personally relevant, people will pay attention to it and spontaneously form inferences. However, if the arguments are hard to follow or consumers' motivation to follow them is lacking, it is safer to the ad to state the conclusions to be drawn.**
* A survey by Legermarketing asked Canadians whether they felt TV advertisements are truthful in their description of products or services being advertised. Only 4 percent of respondents strongly agreed that TV ads were truthful, as against 53 percent who opened distrusted them. What Canadians liked in an ad varied by area, with Quebec residents having quite different preferences from thosse living in other provinces.

###### Subheader: COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING
* Comparative advertising refers to a strategy wherein a message identifiies two or more specifically named or recognitzably presented brands and compares them in terms of one or more specific attributes.
* This strategy yielded mixed results. Although some comparative ads result in desired attitude change, or positive sub(A,ad), they have also beewn found to be lwoer in believaility and may result in more source derogation (i.e., the consumer may doubt the credibility of a biased presentation). Indeed, in some cultures (such as in Asias) comparative advertising is rare, because people find such a confrontational approach offensive.
* **Comparative ads do appear to be effective in the case of new products.** Here, they are superior in anchoring a new brand closer to a dominant one and in building a clear brand image. However, if the aim is to compare the new brand with teh market leader in terms of specific product attributes, merely saying it is as good as or better than the leader is not sufficient. For example, in a study about a fictitious product, the claim "Srping has the same flurid as Crest" resulted in attitude change for the "product", while the more global statement "Preferred by Eruopeans in comparison with Crest" did not. And comparative ads are credible only if they don't reach too far by comparing a brand to a competitor that is obviously superior. Not too surprisingly, for example, a survey of new car buyers found TV commercials comparing a Nissan Altima to a Mercedes were not effective.

### Header: Types of Message Appeals
* The way something is said can be as significant as what is said; the same idea can be encoded in many different ways. It can tug at the heartstrings or scare you, make you laugh, make you cry, or leave you wanting to learn more. In this section we'll review the major alternatives availble to communicators who wish to appeakl to a message recipient.

###### Subheader: EMOTIONAL VERSUS RATIONAL APPEAL
* The French firm L'Oreal has persuade million of women around the world to buy its personal-care products by promising them Parisan chic, associating them with its sexy spokewomen, and touting the self-assured slogan "Becuase you're worth it". Now the company is feeling pressure from an unlikely rival.
* Procter & Gamble is applying the no-nonsense commparative advertisng strategy that the company has used for a long time to sell many of its products to cosmetics. After P&G acquired Clairol in 2001, the company, better known for Tide detergent and many other household products, suddenly became the alrgest seller of cosmetics in supermarkets and club stores. One P&G promotion for Pantene hair conditioner offered a "10-day challenge", promising hair that are 60 percent healthier, 85 percent shinier, 80 percent less prone to breakage, and 70 percent less frizzy. In another case, after using 60 differnt methods to messaure the size of pores, length of wrinkles, and the colour and size of age spots, P&G reseachers used results from one of their tests to proclaim in national ads that Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream worked better than leading department store brands (including those made by L'Oreal). Now P&G is trying to penetrate t he high-end market where L'Oreal currently rules. The head of of L'Oreal sneers at this factual approach by arguing that when it comes to selling cosmetics, "you have to both inform, convince but also seduce consumers ... and not just ram facts down their throats"
* So which is better: to appeal to the head or the heart? The answer often depends on the nature of teh product and the type of relationship consuemrs have with it. Many companies turned to this strategy after realizing that consumers do not find many differences among brands, especially those in well-established, mature categories. Ads for products ranging from cars to greeting cards focus instead on emotional aspects.
* The precise effects of rational versue emotional appeals are hard to gauge. Through recall of ad contents tends to be better for "thinking" ads than for "feeling" ads, conventional measures of advertising effectiveness (such as day-after recall) may not be adequate to assess cumulative effects of emotional ads. These open-ended measures are oriented toward cognitive responses, and feeling ads may be penalized because the reactions are not as easy to articulate.

###### SEX APPEALS
* Under the assumption that "sex sells", many campaigns--for everything from perfumes to automobiles--features heavy doses of erotic suggestions that range from subtle hints to blatant display of skin. Perhaps not surprisingly, female nudity in print ads generate negative feelings and tension among female consumers, while men's reactions are more positive. In a case of turnabout being fair play, another study found that males dislike nude males in ads, whereas female responded well to undressed males--but not totally nude ones.
* Research has also shown the importance of product fit with sex apepals. Sexual imagery paired with products that have little to do with sex (e.g., socket wrenches) has been shown to produce negative reactions from both geners. The poor fit between the sex appeal and the product was seen to be gratuitous and unnecessary. However, when cognitive busy (ie, when an individual is unable to give full attention to an ad), male consumers were shown to react positively to sexual imagery in ads regardless of product fit.Interestingly, negative responses from female consumers were reduced in this instance if the sex appeal was framed to promoted commitment and relationship. It seems the softening of tehe sex appeal in this way makes the advertisement more acceptable to a femal audience.
* **DOES SEX WORK?** A research firm recently explored how men and women look at sexually themed ads and what effect, if any , what they choose to look at might have on the ads' effectiveness. One part of the study used special software to follow the visual behaviour of respondents as they look at ten print ads. The ad sample consisted of two ads, one sexual and one nonsexual, from each of five product categories. When the participants looked at a sexual ad, men tended to ignore the text, focusing instead on the woman in it, whereas the women participants tended first to explore the ad's text elements. Men said they liked the sexual ads more, liked the product advertised in them mroe, and would be more likely to buy those products. Women scored the sexual ads lower than the nonsexual ones on all three of those criteria.

###### HUMOROUS APPEALS
* The use of humour can be tricky, particularly since what is funny to one person may be offensive or incomprehensible to another. Specific cultures have different senses of humour and also use funny material in diverse ways. For example, commercials in the United kingdom and Canada are more likely to use puns and satire than those in the United States.
* **DOES HUMOUR WORK?** Overall, humorous advertisements do get attention. One study found that recognition scores for humours liquor ads were better than average. However, the verdict is mixed as to whether humour affect recall or product attidues in a significant way. Humour can be effective when it provides a source of distraction. A funny ad inhibits  the consumer from counterarguing. this, in turn, increases the likelihood of message acceptance. one suggestion is that for an advertisement to be funny, it needs to be simultaneously violate expectation and be beinign (i.e., not overly offensive)
* Of course, for different people what is considered offensive can differ. What do you think of the advertisement shown here for Pepsi Twist? Is it humourous or offensive?
* Humour is more likely to be effective when the brand is clearly identified and teh funny material does not "swamp" the message. This danger is similar to that of beautiful models diverting attention from copy points. Subtle humour is usually better, as is humour that does not make fun of the potential consumer.
* Humour should also be approrpiate to teh product's image. An undertaker or a bank might watn to avoid humour, while other products adapt to it quite well. For example, successful marketers of beer often incorporate humour into their advertising.
* Finally, a study by two University of McGill researchers found humours messages can temper ads for threatening situations. **For example, people do not want to think too much about disease or other avoidance situations. When the message for these negative scenarios was couched in humour, the advertisements were better received.**

###### FEAR APPEALS
* Fear appeals highlight the negative consequences that can occur if the consumer fails to change a behaviour or attitude. The arousal of fear is common tactic for public policy issues, such as convincing consumers to stop smoking or drive safely
* The tactic can also be applied to social-risk issues by appealing to people's anxieties about their careers or lvoe lives. This tactic has been half-jokingly called the "slice of death" approach. **One increasingly common fear appeal is to prey on people's insecurity about being laid off from their jobs.** In a spot for Contac cold medicine, a construction worker wades through a rainstorm. He says that he needed to take Contact to get to work that day, adding "No work, no pay." This ad was developed after interviews with about 800 consumers indicated widespread anxiety about losing their jobs because of illness.
* **DOES FEAR WORK?** Fear appeals are usually most effective when only a moderate amount of fear is induced. The relationship between fear and attidue change is *non-monotonic*. This means that increasing levels of fear does not result in increased change; the relationship instead resembles an inverted U-shaped curve. If the threat is too great, the audience tends to deny that it exists as a way to rationalizing the danger.
* Fear appeals appear to be most effective when the consumer is already afriad of the problem discussed in the ad. The threats should not be excessive, and a solution in the problem should be presented. (Otherwise, consuemrs will tune out the ad, since they can do nothing to solve the problem). Fear appeals also work better whne source credibility is high.
* Astudy that manipulated subjects' degrees of anxiety about AIDS, for example, found  that condom ads were evaluated most positively when a moderate amount of fear was induced. In this context, copy that promoted the use of teh condom because "sex is a risky business" (moderate fear) resulted in more attitude change than either a low fear appeal that emphasized the product's sensitivity or a high-fear appeal that discussed the certainty of death from AIDS. Similarly, scare tactics have not been as effective as hoped in getting teenagers to decrease their use of alcohol or drugs. Teens simply tune out the message or deny its relevance to them. on the other hand, a study of adolescent responses to social threat versus physical threat appeals in drug prevention messages found that social threat is a more effective strategy.
* Some of the research of fear appeal may be confusing a threat (the literal content of a message, such as saying "Engage only in safe sex or die") with fear (an emotional resposne to the message). According to this argument, greater fear does result in greater persuasion--but not all threats are equally effective because different people will respond differently to the same threat. Therefore, the strongest threats are not always the most persuasive, because they may not have teh desire impact on the perceiver. For example, raising the spectre of AIDS is about the strongest threat that can be delivered to sexually active kids--but this tactic is effective only if the kids believe they will get the disease. Since many young people (especially those who live in fairly affluent suburban or rural areas) don't believe that "people like them" will be exposed to the AIDS virus, this strong threat may not actually result in a high level of fear. The bottom line is that more precise measures of actual fear responses are needed before definitive conclusion can be drawn about the impact of fear appeals on consumption decision.

### Header: The Message as Art Form: Metaphors Be with You
* Marketers may be thought of as storytellers who supply visions of reality similar to those provided by authors, poets, and artists. These communications take the form of stories because the product benefit they describe are intangible and must be given tangible meaning by being expressed in a form that is concrete and visible. Advertising creatives rely (consciously or not) on various literary devices to communicate these meanings. For example, a product or service might be personified by a character such as Mr. Goodwrench, the Jolly Green Giant, or the California Raisins. Many ads take the form of an allegory, wherein about an abstract trait or concept that has been personified as a person, animal, or vegetable.
* A **metaphor** involves the use of an explicit comparison, such as "A is B" (Air Canada is your friend in faraway places"). Metaphors allow the marketer to activate meaningful images and apply them to everyday event. In the stock market, "white knights" battle "hostile raiders" using "poison pills", while Tony the Tiger allows us to equate cereal with strength, and the Merrill Lynch bull sends the message that the company is "a breed apart".
* **Resonance is another type of literary device that is frequently used in advertising. It is a form of presentation that combines a play on words with a relevant picture. Table 8-3 gives some examples of actual ads that rely on the principle of resonance. Although metaphor substitutes one meaning for another by connecting two things that are in some way similar, **reasonance uses an element that has a double meaning, such as a pun, in which there is a similarity in the sound of a word but a difference in meaning. For example, an ad for a diet strawberry shortcake dessert might bear the copy "berried treasure" so that qualities associated with buried treasure--being rich, hidden, and associated with adventurous pirates-are conveyed for the brand. Because the text departs from expectations, it creates a state of tension or uncertainty in the viewer until he or she figures out the wordplay. Once the consumer "gets it", he or she may prefer the ad over a more straightforward message.

                Table 8-3: Some Example of Advertising Reasonance
                
                * Embassy Suites: "This Year, We're Unwrapping Suites by the Dozen" => Chocolate kisses with hotel name underneath each kiss
                * Toyota auto parts: "Our Lifetime Guarantee May Comme as a Shock" => Man holding a shock absorber
                * Bounce fabric softener: "Is There Something Creeping Up Behind You?" => Woman's dress bunched up on her back
                * Pepsi: "This Year, Hit the Beach Topless" => Pepsi bottle cap lying on the sand
                * ASICS atheletic shoes: "We Believe Women Should be Running the Country"=> Woman jogging in a rural setting.

###### Subheader: FORMS OF STORY PRESENTATION
* Just as a story can be told in words or pictures, the way the audience is addressed can also make a difference. Commercials are structured like other art forms, borrowing conventions from literature and art as they commmunicate their messages.
* One important distinction is between a drawma and a lecture. A lecture is like a speech in which the source speaks directly to the audience members in an attempt to inform them about a product or to persuade them to buy it. Because a lecture clearly implies an attempt at persuasion, the audience will regard it as such. Assuming listeners are motivated to do so, they will weigh the merits of the message along with the credibility of the source. Cognitive responses, such as counterargumentation, will occur. The appeal wil lbe accepted to the extent that it overcomes the consumer's obejctions and is congruent with his or her beliefs.
* In contrast, a drama is similar to a play or a movie. While an argument holds the viewer at arm's length, a drama draws the viewer into the action. The characters address the audience only indirectly; they interact with each other about a product or service in an imaginary setting. Dramas attempt to be experiential--to involve the audience emotionally. **In transformational advertising, the consumer associates the experience of product usage with some subjective sensation. Thus, ads for the Infinit attempted to transform the "driving experience" into a mystical, spiritual event.**

## Bigheader: THE SOURCE VERSUS THE MESSAGE: SELL THE STEAK OR THE SIZZLE
* Two major components of the communications model--the source and the message--have been reviewed. Which aspect has the most impact on persuading consumers t ochange their attitudes? **Should marketers worry more about what is said or about how it said and who says it?**
* The answer is that it depends. Variations in a consumer's level of involvement, as discussed in Chapter 4, result in the activation of very different cognitive processes when a message is received. Research indicates that this level of involvement will determine which aspects of a communication are processed. **The situation resembles that of a traveller who comes to a fork in the road and can choose only one path. The decision will have a big impact on the factors that will make a difference in persuasion attempts.**

### Header: The Elaboration Likelihood Model
The elbaoration likelihood model (ELM) assumes that once a consumer receives a message, he or she begins to process it. Depending on the personal relevance of the information, one of two routes to perusasion will be followed. Under conditions of high involvement, the consumer takes the central route to persuasion. Under conditions of low involvement, a peripheral route is taken instead. This model is diagrammed in Figure 8-7

                The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion

                COMMUNICATION (source, message, channel) => Attention and Comprehension

                => High-Involvement Processing-> Cognitive Responses-> Belief and Attitude Change-> Behaviour Change

                => Low-Involvement Processing-> Belief Change-> Behaviour Change-> Attitude Change

###### THE CENTRAL ROUTE TO PERSUASION
* When the consumer finds the information in a persuasive message to be relevant or somehow interesting, he or she will carefully attend to the message content. The person is likely to think actively about the arguments presented and **generate cognitive responses to these arguments**. Upon hearing a radio message warning about drinking while pregnant, an expetant mother might say to herself, "She is right. I really should stop drinking alcohol now that I'm pregnant". Or she might offer counterarguments, such as "That is a bunch of bloney. My mother had a cocktail every night when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out fine." **If a person generates counterarguments in response to a message, it is likely that he  or she will yield to the message, while the generation of further supporting arguments increase the probability of compliance.
* The central route to persuasion is likely to involve the traditional hierarchy of effects, as disussed in Chapter 7. Beliefs are carefully formed and evaluated, and strong attitudes that are then formed will be likely to guide behaviour. The implication is that message factors, such as the quality of arguments presented, will be important in determining attitude change. Prior knowledge about a topic may result in more thoughts about the message and will also increase the number of counterarguments.

###### THE PERIPHERAL ROUTE TO PERSUASION
* In contrast, the peripheral route is taken when the person is not motivated to think about the arguments presented. **Instead, the consumer is likely to use other cues in deciding on the suitability of the message. These cues might include the product's package, the attractiveness of the source, the attractiveness of the source, or the conntext in which the message is presented. Sources of information extraneous to the actual message content are called peripheral cues because they surround the actual message.
* The peripheral route to persuasion highlights the paradox of low involvement discussed in Chapter 4: **When consumers do not care about a product, the stimuli associated with it increase in importance. The implication here is that low-involvement products may be purchased chiefly because the marketer has done a good job designing a "sexy" package, choosing a popular spokesperson, or perhaps just creating a pleasant shopping environment.

### Header: Support for the ELM model
* The ELM approach has received a lot of research support. In one typical study, undergraduates were exposed to one of several mock advertisements for Break, a new brand of low-alcohol beer. Using the technique of thought-listing or cognitive responses, students were asked to provide their thoughts about the ads, which were asked to provide their thoughts about the ads, which were later analyzed by the researchers. Three independent variables crucial in the ELM were manipulated:

1. Message-processing involvement: Some subjects were motivated to be highly involved with the ads by being promised a gift of low-alcohol beer for participating in the study and by being told that the brand would soon be available in their area. Subject who were not promised a gift and who were told that the brand would be introduced in a distant area had low involvement.
2. Argument strength: One version of the ad using strong, compelling arguments to drink Break ("Break contains one-half the amount of alcohol of regular beers and therefore has less calorie than regular beer"), while the other listed only weak argument ("Break is just as good as any other regular beer")
3. Source characteristics: Although both ads contained a photo of a couple drinking the beer, their relative social attractiveness was varied by their dress, posture, and nonverbal expressions, and by the background information given about their educational achievement and occupations.

* Consistency with the ELM model, high-involvement subjects had more thoughts related to the ad messages than did low-involvement subjects, who devoted more cognitive activity to the sources used in the ad. The attiudes of high-involvement subjects were more likely to be swayed by powerful arguments, while the attitudes of low-involvement subjects were more likely to be influenced by the ad version using attractive sources. The results of this study, parid with those of others, indicate that the relative effectiveness of a strong message and a favourable source depends on consumers' level of involvement with the product being advertised.
* These results underscore the basic idea that highly involved consumers look for the "steak" (strong, rational argument), while those who are less involved are more affected by the "sizzle" (the colours and images used in packaging, or endorsements by famous people). It is important to remember, however, that the same communications variable can be both a central and a peripheral cue, depending on its relation to the attitude object. The physical attractiveness of a model might serve as a peripheral cue in a car commercial, but her beauty might be a central cue for a product such as shampoo, where the product's benefits are directly tied to enhancing attractiveness.

## CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR CHALLENGE
Discuss
1. What are the pros and cons of using rational versus emotional appeals (i.e., trying to persuade consumers by focusing on what they know as opposed to what they feel?) When should marketers use one type or the other?
2. A flog is a fake blog a company posts to build buzz around its brand. Is this ethical?
3. The sleeper effect implies that perhaps we shouldn't worry too much about how positively people evaluate a source. Similarly, there's a saying in public relations that "any publicity is good publicity". Do you agree? Why or why not? MY: no, because of balance theory, a bad reputation is created cognitive ressonance of the product and may cause the consumer to change his attitude to the product
4. Discuss some conditions under which it would be advisable to use a comparative advertising strategy.
5. A marketer must decide whether to incorporate rational or emotional appeal in its commmunications strategy. Describe conditions that are more favourable to using one or the other.
6. Many companies rely on celebrity endorsers as communications sources to persuade consumers. Especially when targeting younger people, these spokespeople are often "cool" musicians, athletes, or movie stars. In your opinion, who would be the most effective celebrity endorser today and why? Who would be the least effective? Why?
7. The website for Swiss Legend, a watch brand (www.swisslegend.com), includes a section called "Celebrity Red Room" where there are photographs of famous people sporting the timepieces with their colourful and graphically striking designs. Swiss Legend has found its way to these people, even though it hasn't been found its way to these people, even though it hasn't been around very long, in part because it has been "associated with" events such as the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards and the Teen Choice Awards. This means that it has arranged to have its products given away at those events, a practice called "gifting the talent". The point is not just to get celebrities to wear Swiss Legend watches, which sell in the $150-to-$450 range, but also to leverage the press coverage that focuses on what celebrities wear. The stars have been getting their Swiss Legends by way of Backstage Creations, one of several companies that oversee what has become standard practice at awards shows and other galas. One method of gifting the talent is through "goody bags", whose contents are often listed in the celebrity press. Backstage Creations also offers a more elaborate approach, creating an entire backstage environment--or "retreat"--laid out and decorated by an interior designer and filled with complimentary products. What do you think about the practice of "gifting the talent" to accumulate endorsements? Is this a sound strategy? Is it ethical for celebrities to accept these gifts?

Experiential Exercises
8. A government agency wants to encourage the use of designated drivers by people who have been drinking. What advice could you give the organization about constructing persuasive communications? Discuss some factors that might be important, including  the structure of the communications, where they should appear, and who should deliver them. Should fear appeals be used, and if so, how?
9. Why would a marketer consider saying negative t hings about his or her product? When is this strategy feasible? Can you find examples of it?
10. Collect ads that rely on sex appeal to sell products. How often are benefits of the actual product communicated to the reader?
11. Observe the process of counterargumentation by asking a friend to talk out loud while watching a commercial. Ask him or her to respond to each point in the ad or to write down reactions to the claims made. How much skeptism regarding the claims can you detect?
12. Make a log of all the commmercials shown on one network TV channel during a two-hour period. Categorize each according to product category and whether they are presented as drama or argument. Describe the types of messages used (eg, two-sided arguments), and keep track of the types of spokespeople (eg, TV actors, famous people, animated characters). What can you conclude about the dominant forms of persuasive tactics currently employed by marketers?
13. Collect examples of ads that rely on the use of metaphors or resonance. Do you feel these ads are effective? If you were marketingn the products, would you feel more comfortable with ads that use a more straightforward, "hard sell" approach? Why or why not?
14. Create a list of current celebrities whom you feel typify cultural categories (e.g., clown, mother figure). What specific brands do you feel each might effectively endorse?
15. Conduct an "avatar hunt" by going to commerce websites, online video game sites, and online communities such as The Sims that let people select what they want to look like in cyberspace. What seem to be the dominant figures people are choosing? Are they realistic or fantasy characters? Male or female? What types of avatars do you believe would be most effective for each of these different kinds of websites, and why?


# Chatper 9: Individual Decision Making

## Bigheader: CONSUMERS AS PROBLEM SOLVERS
* A consumer purchase may be response to a perceived problem. These situations are encountered by consuemrs virtually every day of their lives: They realize that they want to make a purchase and go through a series of steps to do so. These steps can be described as 1) problem recognition, 2) information search, 3) evaluation of alternatives, and 4) product choice. Of course, after the decision is made, the quality of that decision affects the final step in the process, when learning occurs based on how well the choice worked out. This learning process in turn influences the likelihood that the same choice will be made the next time the need for a similar decision occurs. An overview of this decision-making process appears in Figure 9-1.

        Figure 9-1 Stages in Consumer Decision Making

        problem Recognition ==> Bill realizes he's fed up with a black-and-white TV that has bad sound reproduction=>

        information Search => Bill talks to a few friends about buying a new TV=>

        Evaluation of Alernatives => Bill compares several models in the store in terms of reputation and available features.=>

        Product choice => Bill chooses one model because it has a feature that really appeals to him=>

        Consumption and Learning => Bill brings home the TV and enjoys his purchase => Problem Recognition

* This chapter begins by considering various approaches consumers use when faced with a purchase decision. It then focuses on three of the steps in the decision process: 1) how consumers recognitze the problem or need for a product: 2) their search for information about product choices; and 3) the ways in which they evaluate alternatives to arrive at a decision.
* Because some purchase decisions are more important than others, the amount of effort we put into each differs. Sometimes the decision-making process is done almost automatically; we seem to make snap judgment based on very little information. At other times, coming to a purchase decision begins to resemble a full-time job. A person may literally spend days or weeks thinking about an important purchase, such as a new home, even to the point of obsession.
* The intensive decision-making process gets even more complicated in today's environment where we have so many options to choose from. Ironically, for many modern consumers one of the biggest problems is not having too few choices but too many. We can think of this profusion options as consumer hyperchoice, a condition where the large number of available options forces us to make repeated choices that may drain psychological energy while decreasing our abilities to make smart decisions.
* Indeed, research suggests that consumers are overwhelmed with the number of options available in the marketplace, and too much choice can lead consumers to be less satisfied with the purchase experience and less likely to choose within the product category. For example, one study allowed customers in a grocery store to select and try a sample from an assortment of flavoured fruit jam. In the "limited choice" condition, consumers were asked to choose from 6 flavors and in the "extensive choice" condition they were asked to choose from 24 flavours. While both groups tried just one or two flavours, their purchasing behaviour varied dramatically: only 3 percent of those in the "extensive choice" group bought a jar of jam, compared to 30 percent in the "limited choice" group. Having extensive options available has also been suggested to have negative psychological consequences for individual consumers. Consumers who are characterized by a desire to look at all of the options in a way that allows for the best possible choice (maximizers) are more anxious and depressed than their satisficing counterparts (who simply select an option good enough to satisfy their needs)

### Header: Perspectives on Decision Making
* Traditionally, consumer researchers have approached decision makers from a **rational perspective**. In this view, people calmly and carefully integrate as much information as possible with what they already know about a product, painstaking weigh the pluses and minuses of each alternative, and arrive at a satisfactory decision. This traditional perspective relate the economics of information approach to the search process; it assumes that we colelct just as much data as we need to make an informed decision. We form expectations of the value of additional information and continue to search to the extent that the rewards of doing so (what economists call the utility) exceed the costs. This utilitarian assumption also implies that we collect the most valuable units of information first. We absort additional pieces only to the extent that we think they will add to what we already know. In other words, we'll put ourselves out to collect as much information as we can, so long as the process of gathering isn't too onerous or time-consuming.

### Header: Stages in Consumer Decision Making
* This process implies that steps in decision making should be carefully studied by marketing managers to understand how information is obtained, how beliefs are formed, and what product-choice criteria are speicified by consumers. Product can then be developed that emphasize appropirate attributes, and promotional strategies can be tailored to deliver the types of information more likely to be desired in the most effective formats.
* Althoug these decision-making steps are followed by consumers for some purchases, this process is not an accurate portrayal of many purchase decisions. Consumers simply do not go thorugh this elaborate sequence for every decision. If they did, their entire lives would be spent making such decisions, leaving them very little time to enjoy the things they eventually decide to buy. Some of our buying behaviours simply don't seem "rational"; they don't serve a logical purpose (eg, collecting red shoes). Other purchases are made with virutally no advance planning at all (eg, impulsive grabbing that tempting candy bar from the rack while waiting to pay for groceries). Still other actions are actually contrary to those predicted by rational models. For example, **purchase momentum** occurs when these initial impulses acutally increase the likelihood that we will buy even more (instead of less as our needs are satisfied), almost as if we get "revved up" and plunge into a spending spree (think of shopping at Winners). And recent research hints that people differ in terms of their cognitive processing style. Some of us tend to have a rational system of cognition that processes information analytically and sequentially using rules of logic, while others rely on an experiential system of cognition that processes information more holistically and in parallel.
* Researchers now realize that decision makers acutally possess a repertoire of strategies. A consumer evaluates the effort required to make a particular choice, and then he or she chooses a strategy best suited to the level of effort required. This sequence of events is known as constructive processing. Rather than using a big club to kill an ant, consumers tailor their degree of cognitive "effort" to the task at hand. When the task requires a well-thought-out, rational approach, we'll invest the brainpower to do it. Otherwise, we look for shortcuts or fall back on learned response that "automate" these choices.
* Some decisions are made under conditions of **low involvement**, as discussed in Chapter 4. In many of these situations, the consumer's decision is a learned response to environmental cues (see Chapter 3), as when a person decides to buy something on impulse that is promoted as a "surprise special" in a store. Concentrating on these types of decisions can be described as the **behavioural influence perspective**. Under these circumstances managers must concentrate on **assessing the characteristics of the environment, such as physical surroundings and product placement, that influence members of a target market.**
* In other cases consumers are highly involved in a decision, but this involvement not lend itself to the rational approach. For example, the traditional approach is hard pressed to explain a person's choice of art, music, or even a romantic partner. In these caess no single quality is the determining factor. Instead, the **experiential perspective** stresses the gestalt, or totality, of the product or the service. Marketers focus on measuring consumers' affective responses to products or services and develop offerings that elicit appropriate subjective reactions.

### Header: Types of Consumer Decisions
* One helpful way to characterize the decision-making process is to consider the amount of effort that goes into the decision each time it must be made. Consumer researchers have found it convenient to think in terms of a continuum, which is anchored at one end by **habitual decision making** and at the oter by **extended problem solving**. Many decisions fall somewhere in the middle and are charaterized by **limited problem solving.

                HABITUAL DECISION MAKING (Low-Cost Products, Frequent Purchasing, Low Consumer Involvement, Familiar Product Class and Brands, Little Thought, Search, or Time given to Purchase)        =>
                
                LIMITED PROBLEM SOLVING (More expensive product, infrequent purchasing, high consumer involvement, unfamiliar product class and brands, extensive thought, search, and time given to purchase)

###### Subheader: HABITUAL DECISION MAKING
* Habitual problem solving involves decisions that are made wit hlittle or no conscious effort. Many purchase decisions are so rountine that we may not realize we've made them until we look in our shopping carts. Choices characterized by automaticity are performed with minimal effort and without conscious control. Although this kind of thoughless activity may seem dangerous, at best, stupid, it is actually an efficient way to operate. The development of habitual, repetitive behaviour allows consumers to minimize the time and energy spent on mundame purcahse decisions.
* On the other hand, habitual decision making poses a problem when a marketer tries to introduce a new way of doing an old task. In this case consumers must be onvinced to "unfreeze" their former habits and replace them with new ones. Changing consuemrs' habits is the obstacle now confronting a device caleld the Personal Valet, a cabinet-size clothes refresher made by Whirlpool that removes odours and wrinkles using a chemical forumula developed by P&G. For the product to succeed, the two companies must find a way to "unfreeze" the habit of taking one's clothes to the dry cleaner.

###### Subheader: LIMITED PROBLEM SOLVING
* Limited problem solving is usually  somewhat straightforward and simple, but does require some cognitive processing. Buyers are not necesasrily motivated to search for information or to evalute each alternative rigorously, but they are simply acting out of habit either. People instead use simple decision rules to choose among alternatives. These cognitive shortcuts enable them to fall back on general guidelines instead of having to start from scratch every time a decision is to be made.

###### Subheader: EXTENDED PROBLEM SOLVING
* Decisions involving extended problem solving correspond most closely to the traditional decision-making perspective. As indicated in Table 9-1, the extended problem-solving process is usually initiated by a motive that is fairly central to the self-concept (see Chapter 5), and the eventual decision is percieved to carry a fiar degree of risk. The consumer tries to collect as much information as possible, both from memory (internal serach) and from outside sources (external search). on the basis of teh importance of the decision, each product alternative is carefully evaluated. The evaluation is often done by considering the attributes of one brand at a time and seeing how each brand's attributes shape up to some set of desired characteristics.
* next, the decision will turn to the stages involved in the extended-problem solving context

## Bigheader: PROBLEM RECOGNITION
* Ford's plan to promote its Fusion hybrid model focused on people who aren't thinking about buying a new car--at least not right now. Its TV commercials targeted what the auto industry terms the "upper funnel", or potential buyers down the road. Ford's research found that a large number of U.S. drivers still are unaware of the Fusion. The company is confident that it can close sales if and then customers decide to buy a new car. But its weak spot is to get people into the frame of mind where they want to do that. To create desire where there is none now, visitors to special website entered to win a trip and a new Fusion. Ford publicized the sweepstakes on Twitter and Facebook; during the first weeks of the promotion, almost 70,000 people requested more information about the car.
* **Problem recognition occurs at what Ford terms "the upper funnel" when we experience a significant difference between our current state of affairs and some state we desire. We realize that to get from her to there we need to solve a problem ,which may be small or large, simply or complex. A person who unexpected runs out of gas on the highway has a problem, as does the person who become dissatisfied with the image of his car, even though there is nothing mechanically wrong with it. Although the quality of Richard's TV had not changed, he altered his standard of comparison, and as a result h had a new problem to solve--how to improve his TV experience?
* Problems arise in one of two ways. The person who runs out of gas experiences a decline in the quality of his actual state--need reconition. In contrast, the person who craves a newer flashier car moves his ideal state-opportunity recognition, there is a gulf between the actual state and the ideal state. Richard perceived a problem due to opportunity recognition--he moved his ideal state upward in terms of the quality of TV reception he craved. Figure 9-3 highlights how opportunity reconition and need recognition can occur.

                Figure 9-3: problem Recognition: Shift in Actual or Ideal States

                OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION: Ideal gets higher
                NEED RECONITION: Actual state gets lower

* Need reconition occurs in several ways. A person's actual state can decrease if he or she runs out of a product or buys a product that doesn't adequately satisfy their needs, or if he or she has a new need or desire. For example, whe nyou buy a house, this sets of an avalanche of other choices, because now you need to buy many things to fill it--assuming there's any more left over! In contrast, opportunity recognition often occurs when we're exposed to different or better quality products, or a particular compelling price. This happens because our circumstances change, as when we start college or land a new job. As our frame of reference shifts, we make purchases to adapt to the new environment.
