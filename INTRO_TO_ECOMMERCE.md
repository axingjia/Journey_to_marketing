* In a successful ecommerce operation, three elements--internet technology, business mmodel, and marketing--are well integrated. A problem arises when one element is missing or not well executed.

* The manager of tomorrow is faced with six new issues--efficiency, value, measurability, dense networking, interactivity, and a global marketplace

* Companies using the Internet have reexamined and streamlined their supply chains to reduce inventory-holding costs, reduce the time to market, and improve demand forecasting.

* CIO.com provides four commandments for online B2C companies who wish to succeed: 1. be diverse; 2. Exploit your channels; 3. Be frugal; 4. Avoid business models with high customer acquisition and low profit margins

* Business 2.0 magazine also has presented a list of "habits of persistent dot-com":

        1. Forget the exit strategy--aim to build a real business as opposed to something that will be bought out
        2. Niche-ify yourself
        3. Aim for high margins
        4. Get small fast--large does not necessarily equal larger profits
        5. Hunt for bargains at the Web fire sale

* A business model consists of business objectives, a value delivery system, and a revenue model. The path to shareholder value maximization goes through customer value maximization, so delivering value to the customer is vital. A revenue model is comprised of the set of revenue streams that contribute to the company's profitability. The company must maintain a rich portfolio of revenue stream without losing its focus. In addition, every business that has both a physical and a virtual component, must understand the interrelationship of these two spaces in order to thrive.

* Since customer demand drives supply chains, they must be **customer-centric**. Carefully observing the market helps reduce and improve efficiency. Some have even argued that the term "supply chain" should be replaced by "demand network" or "customer-driven Web".

* There are three flows within any supply chain--physical goods, money, and information. The central movement is t hat of physical goods from manufacturers to consumers; financial flows and information flows facilitate movement.

* **Financial flows** are the movement of financial payments among the different companies that facilitate the forward movement of physical goods. Unless a downstream intermediary (e.g., wholesaler) has made the appropriate financial arrangement, an upstream comapny (e.g., manufacturer) will not ship the good. Companies may have complex financial arrangements with other agencies in the supply chain (e.g., credit, long-term contracts). Financial intermediaries also provide services such as insurance and escrow.

* One of the most valuable resources within a supply chain is information about the markegtplace (e.g., consumer tastes, demand patterns, inventory). The primary impact of the Internet and Web technology on supply chains has been to ensure that the right person has the right information at the right time. With better information about consumer demand, suppliers are better able to organize their production and manage their inventory. Information equals money in the supply chain. Every time a supplier can reduce invetory costs or produce the right type of product, it reduces costs and boosts profits. Information can also lead to conflict wigthin the supply chain and battles to control information. Many companies are paranoid, for example, about the potential competitive implications of sharing information (e.g., a wholesaler may be in a position to share information with a competing manufacturer)

* Despite these possible problems, effective sharing of marketplace information can help mitigate problems such as "bullwhip effect". Even though customer demand may be relatively stable, one observes greater variablility in orders as one moves up a supply chain. In other words, even a stable market demand could lead to a volatile order pattern for manufacturers. The phenomenon could be due to a variety of factors; one scenario would be retailers stocking up for future months when volume discounts are provided. Whatever the cause, the impact of the bullwhip effect on the supply chain can be huge: greater inventory may be held at different places in the chain, leading to greater costs; production facilities may not used optimally; and so on. Better information flow between members of a supply chain can help avoid these problems. For instance, Walmart is frequently praised for relaying point-of-sale information up the supply chain so that planning can be improved.

### Benefits of Internet Technology
* By facilitating bettter information flows in the supply chain, the Internet and Web technology can help supply chain management (SCM) in three important ways--sharing knowledge, increasing the speed of response, and reducing the costs of servicing a market.
* First, using Internet and Web technology, it is now possible to share knowledge among participants in a supply chain. The large companies in a supply chain can easily provide inmntermediaries with information on market and industry trends. Specific information about the market collected by salespeople and retailers can reach manufacturers faster.
* Second, using gthe Internet, companies can respond faster to changes in customer demand. Speedier sharing of information about changes in customer tastes or sudden inflections helps firms more quickly bring the appropriate product to the market and align product offerings with market demand.
* The concept of a rolling warehouse illustrates the impact of this technology. In turbulent markets with rapid fluctuations in customer demand, delivering a product over long distances (e.g., from Los Angeles to New York) can become problematic. Typically, trucks stop at multiple warehouses that service local markets. The problem is that the demand at each warehouse may be completely different at the time of delivery than it was when the truck started its journey. Some warehouses may want more units and others may want fewer. The rolling warehouse concept evolved to serve the needs of the market better. Instead of allocating the unit ahead of time to a particular warehouse, the truck leaves without the information about what to drop off where; **using recent demand forecasts, comapnies can provide the truck instructions along the way as to how much to drop off in different locations. Thus, the truck essentially becomes a rolling warehouse.**
* Finally, the Internet and the Web have helped companies reduce the costs of serving a market. Supply chains alwaays have room for improvement. Causes of inefficiency abound and include rigid manufacutring systems, resistance to change, paper-based processes, and so forth. With a streamlined supply chain enabled by the Internet, the costs of each process drop, leading to a more cost-effective method of serving the marketplace.

### A Note on EElectronic Data Interchange (EDI)
* Starting in the 1970s, EDI has been the dominant technology used by large companies (e.g., Sears, Ford, Walmart, and General Motors) to relay information among partners in a supply chain. EDI is a proprietary system taht emerged as a way of getting departments within a large company to share information with one another. Over time, standards were developed that allowed multiple companies to use this system to talk to one another.
* EDI systems are reliable: as one industry expert put it: "EDI is off the shelf, it's tried and true, it's an industrial strength workhourse". However, EDI systems are rigid and their potential for working with other applications is limited. **In the words of another industry expert, "Where you have innovation, competition, rapidly changing business models, EDI is a drag".** It's also expensive; the cost of transmitting information is $25 for every 1,000 characters.
* Many companies that have EDI systems are deciding whether to scrap the entire system or gradually modify what they currently have. Most have taken the latter approach, and are trying to adapt EDI to the Internet, primarily to reduce transmission costs. All types of small business now have access to the Internet, which helps with some supply chains.
* In addition to adapting EDI to the Internet, there is a movement to build extranets. Extranets are Web-based networks among invited partners. They are much more user-friendly than EDI systems beause of the Web interface; however, successful extranets have to overcome the hurdles of security and integration with legacy systems.

### Four Stages of SCM Evolution
* Supply chain evolve in four stages--traditional, integrated, collaboration, and synchronization.
* The traditional supply chain represents the lowest level in the evolution. At this stage, each company in the supply chain thinks of itself as an island that does not have to share any information with the others. Moreover, there is limited information sharing within the corporation, which results in inefficiency. Suppliers without demand information may produce t oo little or too much, and marketers without access to production schedules may distribute product inefficiently.
* The next step in the evoluation is an integrated supply chain. In this stage, there is information sharing within the busienss functions of a company; however; there is no information sharing with outside firms. As a result, several of the inefficiencies already discuss remain.
* The next step in the evolution is a collaborative supply chain. In this stage, there is broader information sharing with suppliers and customers. As a result, transparency and collaboration lead to better responsiveness. As Hau Lee, an expert on SCM, put it:

                 The first problem companies face (in a supply chain) is lack of visibility into your partners' demand forecasts. For example, 3M needs information about Procter & Gamble's production schedule of diapers so that it can plan for the components that go into the diapers. Meanwhile, P&G needs point-of-sale data from Wal-mart to plan its diaper production. Having demand information from everyone in your supply chain lets you synchronize what you are doing with your customers and suppliers. It also helps you avoid some fatal mistakes, such as building too much manufactuering capacity--or too little.

* Cisco is one of the firms that tried to achieve collaboration on a large scale:

                Cisco's plan is  to try to involve not just its first-tier suppliers but the second tiers and third tiers. What the company found is that sometimes when it has material shortage problems or delivery problems, it is becaseu of the second-tier or third tier supplier. For example, the first-tier supplier to Cisco is Solectron. The supplier to Solectron might be Quantum. Then there are suppliers to Quantum. If the supplier to Quantum is late, that creates problems at Quantum, which would then stop production at Solectron. Cisco wants to have information transparencies at all these layers because if Cisco had gotten wind of these problems right away, it could have found an alternative supplier in time to avoid any delays.

* Dell.com is another well-cited example: it has provided access to its data to 90% of its suppliers.
* **The tension involved in greater collaboration comes from two issues. First, companies are reluctant to share information with other corporations, because they fear that such sharing will lead to reduced power. They may also be concerned that their supply chain partners will share information with competitors.
* As one CEO of a leading company said:

                As you know, it means we're all partners, right? I think it means everybody is trying to do the right thing--make decisions quickly and effectively so that everyone across the supply chain understands the ramifications. But every company has its own incentive systems in place. And the truth is, those incentive systems and those priorities and goals need to be in alignment across the supply chain. If they are not, it doesn't matter--you call it collaborative supply chain until you're blue in the face, but it isn't.

* An industry expert places companies into four categories when it comes to collaboration: the not-nows, the nevers, the pretenders, and the real deal. The first set of companies feel that it is not the right time to push for this. The "nevers" feel threatened by collaboration and want to fight it until the bitter end. The pretenders have tried to incorporate collaborative initiatives, but have only made a token effort. On the other extreme, a small set of firms have actually implemented collaborative ideas into SCM practice. Heineken USA, Kmart, Bell Sports, and Hunter Douglas are some of the companies who fall into the last category.
* The second negative aspect of increased collaboration is greater interdependence. As a result, if one firm faces a problem, it spreads quickly to the other parts of the system. For instance, if the comapny has forecasted demand incorrectly, its suppliers are likelier to plan incorrectly. Similarly, a suppler's labor or delivery problem have a more immediate impact on the company and its operations. Companies grapple with this problem by introducing greater redundancy in the system (e.g., adding more suppliers), but this leads to greater operational inefficiency and complexity. There is no easy way out of this.
* A syncronized supply chain represents the final step in the evoluation. This type of supply chain distinguishes itself from the collaborative supply chain by even greater dependence. The goal is not just to share information, but also to synchronize operations. This type of supply chain uses systems that allow a company's operations to be visible to its suppliers and partners. As a result, operations can be synchronized so that there is a seamless transfer of information and products. In thse supply chains, there is greater interactivity among the partners, and often some level of joint planning and shared decision making, rather than one company trying to dictate to everybody else. The boundaries between companies in the supply chain are blurred with greater sharing. Naturally, this type of supply chain requires a radical transformation in the mindset of the mangers and the organization. Table 7.1 summarizes the potential benefits and challenges of synchronized supply chains.

### Introduction to the Distribution Channel
* The distribution channel is the portion of the supply chain that stretches from the manufacturer to the consumer. An organization needs intermediaries to distribute its products for the following reasons:

1. **Intermediaries reduce the cost of distribution. Consider a multiproduct company such as Proter & Gamble. If it were to attempt to distribute all of its products directly to consumers, the cost of contacting each consumer would be tremendous. It would not be feasible to run a store to sell Tide detergent. Working with intermediaries such as supermarkets, the company ensures that the supermarket bears the cost of making the product available to the consumer.**
2. Intermediarires shield manufacturers from risk. Consider the case of McDonald's the global fast-food chain. The company has been able to expand its business rapidly by using a franchising strategy, in which the company provides the knowledge to run the restaurant and access to training and supplies, and a local businessperson puts up the capital required to open the restaurant. If a franchise flops because of low market demand, the risk to McDonald's is not great. The franchiser will survive, even if the local franchise does not.
3. Intermediaries help manufacturers target products. Go back to the example of Procter & Gamble. The company makes a large number of products, but not all of them are suitable for a supermarket. Although Pringles potato chips may be sold only in supermarkets, Pepto-Bismol and prescription drugs ought to be available in drugstores. Different retailers stock different types of products and, hence, appeal to different market segments. By matching a product to a a target segment, the comapny can ensure that the right consumer gets the right product.
4. Intermediaries structure information essential to consumers. Individual buyers face search costs during their buying process: they must compare many products and choose the one that meets their need. Intermediaries provide an information framework that helps consumers shop. For example, supermarkets organized their products in aisles in a familiar pattern to help consumers locate products easily. Similarly, online retailers create a category structure and provide a search function to ensure that consumers can locate the product they want.

* A distribution channel is most effective when each member is assigned the tasks it can do best and all the members' objectives are aligned to meet the specific goals of the channel. Of course, this does not always happen, and the reuslt is conflict. Conflict can be horizontal or vertical, occurring between companies at the same level of the channel. An example of horizontal conflict is, two manufacturers distributing through the same wholesaler may fight over who gets preferential treatment. An e3example of vertical conflict is a retailer who may be unhappy with the treatment by the manufacturer. Managing this conflict effectively is necessary for success.

### An In-Depth Look at E-Fullfillment--The Great Challenge to E-Tailers
* Online retailers are not simply order-takers; **they aim to provide the complete shopping experience, from the order to the product's delivery at the consumer doorstep. A company must be able not just to take orders, but also to fulfill the orders successfully. Accomplishing this is no small task, and e-tailers have quickly realized that planning and managing their e-fulfillment operations efficiently directrly affects their profits.** (Even though this section is focused on e-tailers, much of it is relevant to B2B companies as well.)
* E-fulfillment is not trival. Consider this example: A consumer visits an online bookseller and order six books produced by four different publishers. Once the order is received, the bookseller must figure out how to fill the order. One of the books is in the bookseller's warehouse because it is in great demand; the others require coordination with the publishers. **Based on the relationships with the publishers, some can be shipped directly to the consumer, and others will come to the bookseller's warehouse and will then be forwarded to the consumer.**
* This is the level of complexity of one order. Imagine an online retailer at its peak with hundreds of orders coming in every minute from all over the world. Obviously, organizing e-fulfillment effectively is critical to the profitability of a company.
* Online retailers that did not realize this learned a costly lesson during the 1999 holiday season when they were not able to meet shipping promises. In July 2000, the Federal Trade Commition (FTC) ruled that KBkids.com, Toysurus.com, CDnow, and Macy's.com did not tell their customers quicly enough about delays in the shipment of products. The last three companies on this list paid fines of about $1.5 million to the FTC. Major embarrassment to Toysrus.com forced the company to turn over fulfillment to Amazon.com
* A study conducted at Dartmouth College monitored the fulfillment of online orders worth $14,000 during November and December 2000. They found that:

                * It took an average of 9.5 days from order to delivery
                * 67% of the orders were delivered by the customer-desired date
                * 54% of the orders were delivered by the original e-tailer date
                * 88% of the orders were delivered by january 5,2001.
                * 3% of the orders were cancelled after customer discouragement
                * 70% of the orders received were preceded by an email shipping notice.
                * 32% of the orders used premium shippment (three days or less)

* Online retailers are clearly struggling with their fulfuillment operations
* Of course, many online retailers have learned from these fisascoes. A report on e-fullfillment released by Accenture, a leading consulting company, in December 2001 reported that 98% of all online merchants confirm orders using e-mail compared with 81% a year ago. The study also found that 72% of sites are now able to confirm that a product is in stock--up from 38% one year ago. However, the average number of days it takes for the product to arrive has remained steady at about seven days.
* Fufillment is expensive to every retailer. McKinsey conducted a survey of leading e-tailers (Webvan, Fogdog Sports, and Drugstore.com) in the fourth quarter of 1999. In this study, fulfillment costs ranged from $10 to $14.29 for a typical order, or 12.3% to 60.8% of the revenue expected from the order. These figures do not include shipping costs, which can add from 1.2% to 22.1% of the revenue. Clearly, even if e-tailers brought prices down significantly, these costs would drive them into the red.
* The role of fulfillment costs has become even more important considering the rise of free shipping as a permanent option among online retailers. In January 2002, Amaon.com announced that any order worth more than $99 would receive free shipping. It made this offer in response to a promotion run by bn.com since the middle of 2001 that made shipping free on all orders of two or more items. This "free-shipping war" places more pressure on retailers' profit margins, and renders more urgent the need to reduce fulfillment costs.

### Five E-Fulfillment Strategies
* **A company can adopt four e-fulfillment strategies--logistics postponement, resource exchange, leverage shipments, and brick-and clicks.**
* Some markets are turbulent. Customer demands change quickly, and competitors act swiftly. In such an environment, if a company is commited to shipping certain products to certain markets, it runs the risk of obsolescence. The product may arrive at the market too late or reach the wrong market, and the resulting product return and reshipping costs reduce company profits.
* In such an environment, **logitsics postponement is a valable strategy. Merge-in-transit is one approach to postponement. Instead of collecting all parts at a central location and assembling them there into the final product, merge-in-transit proposes using a logistics service provider located clsoe to the consumer for assembly. This reduces shipping costs and ensures quicker final delivery.**
* Dell.com goes a step further. In its build=to-order system, the computer is built only when the customer order is received. Rather than acquiring the terminal and other computer parts, the company asks the terminal supplier to ship directly to the consumer. The rest of the computer goes from the Dell warehouse. This simple arrangement saves the company money and makes it more competitive in the marketplace.
