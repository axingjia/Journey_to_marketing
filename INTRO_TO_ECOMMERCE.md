* In a successful ecommerce operation, three elements--internet technology, business mmodel, and marketing--are well integrated. A problem arises when one element is missing or not well executed.

* The manager of tomorrow is faced with six new issues--efficiency, value, measurability, dense networking, interactivity, and a global marketplace

* Companies using the Internet have reexamined and streamlined their supply chains to reduce inventory-holding costs, reduce the time to market, and improve demand forecasting.

* CIO.com provides four commandments for online B2C companies who wish to succeed: 1. be diverse; 2. Exploit your channels; 3. Be frugal; 4. Avoid business models with high customer acquisition and low profit margins

* Business 2.0 magazine also has presented a list of "habits of persistent dot-com":

        1. Forget the exit strategy--aim to build a real business as opposed to something that will be bought out
        2. Niche-ify yourself
        3. Aim for high margins
        4. Get small fast--large does not necessarily equal larger profits
        5. Hunt for bargains at the Web fire sale

* A business model consists of business objectives, a value delivery system, and a revenue model. The path to shareholder value maximization goes through customer value maximization, so delivering value to the customer is vital. A revenue model is comprised of the set of revenue streams that contribute to the company's profitability. The company must maintain a rich portfolio of revenue stream without losing its focus. In addition, every business that has both a physical and a virtual component, must understand the interrelationship of these two spaces in order to thrive.

* Since customer demand drives supply chains, they must be **customer-centric**. Carefully observing the market helps reduce and improve efficiency. Some have even argued that the term "supply chain" should be replaced by "demand network" or "customer-driven Web".

* There are three flows within any supply chain--physical goods, money, and information. The central movement is t hat of physical goods from manufacturers to consumers; financial flows and information flows facilitate movement.

* **Financial flows** are the movement of financial payments among the different companies that facilitate the forward movement of physical goods. Unless a downstream intermediary (e.g., wholesaler) has made the appropriate financial arrangement, an upstream comapny (e.g., manufacturer) will not ship the good. Companies may have complex financial arrangements with other agencies in the supply chain (e.g., credit, long-term contracts). Financial intermediaries also provide services such as insurance and escrow.

* One of the most valuable resources within a supply chain is information about the markegtplace (e.g., consumer tastes, demand patterns, inventory). The primary impact of the Internet and Web technology on supply chains has been to ensure that the right person has the right information at the right time. With better information about consumer demand, suppliers are better able to organize their production and manage their inventory. Information equals money in the supply chain. Every time a supplier can reduce invetory costs or produce the right type of product, it reduces costs and boosts profits. Information can also lead to conflict wigthin the supply chain and battles to control information. Many companies are paranoid, for example, about the potential competitive implications of sharing information (e.g., a wholesaler may be in a position to share information with a competing manufacturer)

* Despite these possible problems, effective sharing of marketplace information can help mitigate problems such as "bullwhip effect". Even though customer demand may be relatively stable, one observes greater variablility in orders as one moves up a supply chain. In other words, even a stable market demand could lead to a volatile order pattern for manufacturers. The phenomenon could be due to a variety of factors; one scenario would be retailers stocking up for future months when volume discounts are provided. Whatever the cause, the impact of the bullwhip effect on the supply chain can be huge: greater inventory may be held at different places in the chain, leading to greater costs; production facilities may not used optimally; and so on. Better information flow between members of a supply chain can help avoid these problems. For instance, Walmart is frequently praised for relaying point-of-sale information up the supply chain so that planning can be improved.

### Benefits of Internet Technology
* By facilitating bettter information flows in the supply chain, the Internet and Web technology can help supply chain management (SCM) in three important ways--sharing knowledge, increasing the speed of response, and reducing the costs of servicing a market.
* First, using Internet and Web technology, it is now possible to share knowledge among participants in a supply chain. The large companies in a supply chain can easily provide inmntermediaries with information on market and industry trends. Specific information about the market collected by salespeople and retailers can reach manufacturers faster.
* Second, using gthe Internet, companies can respond faster to changes in customer demand. Speedier sharing of information about changes in customer tastes or sudden inflections helps firms more quickly bring the appropriate product to the market and align product offerings with market demand.
* The concept of a rolling warehouse illustrates the impact of this technology. In turbulent markets with rapid fluctuations in customer demand, delivering a product over long distances (e.g., from Los Angeles to New York) can become problematic. Typically, trucks stop at multiple warehouses that service local markets. The problem is that the demand at each warehouse may be completely different at the time of delivery than it was when the truck started its journey. Some warehouses may want more units and others may want fewer. The rolling warehouse concept evolved to serve the needs of the market better. Instead of allocating the unit ahead of time to a particular warehouse, the truck leaves without the information about what to drop off where; **using recent demand forecasts, comapnies can provide the truck instructions along the way as to how much to drop off in different locations. Thus, the truck essentially becomes a rolling warehouse.**
* Finally, the Internet and the Web have helped companies reduce the costs of serving a market. Supply chains alwaays have room for improvement. Causes of inefficiency abound and include rigid manufacutring systems, resistance to change, paper-based processes, and so forth. With a streamlined supply chain enabled by the Internet, the costs of each process drop, leading to a more cost-effective method of serving the marketplace.

### A Note on EElectronic Data Interchange (EDI)
* Starting in the 1970s, EDI has been the dominant technology used by large companies (e.g., Sears, Ford, Walmart, and General Motors) to relay information among partners in a supply chain. EDI is a proprietary system taht emerged as a way of getting departments within a large company to share information with one another. Over time, standards were developed that allowed multiple companies to use this system to talk to one another.
* EDI systems are reliable: as one industry expert put it: "EDI is off the shelf, it's tried and true, it's an industrial strength workhourse". However, EDI systems are rigid and their potential for working with other applications is limited. **In the words of another industry expert, "Where you have innovation, competition, rapidly changing business models, EDI is a drag".** It's also expensive; the cost of transmitting information is $25 for every 1,000 characters.
* Many companies that have EDI systems are deciding whether to scrap the entire system or gradually modify what they currently have. Most have taken the latter approach, and are trying to adapt EDI to the Internet, primarily to reduce transmission costs. All types of small business now have access to the Internet, which helps with some supply chains.
* In addition to adapting EDI to the Internet, there is a movement to build extranets. Extranets are Web-based networks among invited partners. They are much more user-friendly than EDI systems beause of the Web interface; however, successful extranets have to overcome the hurdles of security and integration with legacy systems.

### Four Stages of SCM Evolution
* Supply chain evolve in four stages--traditional, integrated, collaboration, and synchronization.
* The traditional supply chain represents the lowest level in the evolution. At this stage, each company in the supply chain thinks of itself as an island that does not have to share any information with the others. Moreover, there is limited information sharing within the corporation, which results in inefficiency. Suppliers without demand information may produce t oo little or too much, and marketers without access to production schedules may distribute product inefficiently.
* The next step in the evoluation is an integrated supply chain. In this stage, there is information sharing within the busienss functions of a company; however; there is no information sharing with outside firms. As a result, several of the inefficiencies already discuss remain.
* The next step in the evolution is a collaborative supply chain. In this stage, there is broader information sharing with suppliers and customers. As a result, transparency and collaboration lead to better responsiveness. As Hau Lee, an expert on SCM, put it:
